## Transcript

Jason Lemkin (00:00:00):
Here's the mistake that 99% of founders and sales reps make. We're not really selling in B2B, we're solving problems. Our job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition, I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. I've even got a special discount for the end of this month, and let me just help you. I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I've explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house. There's only Superchargers. I got you, don't I? That's the job of SaaS and sales because we're not selling commodities.

Lenny (00:00:48):
Today, my guest is Jason Lemkin. Jason created and runs Saastr, the world's largest community for SaaS and B2B founders. He also runs two of the biggest town conferences every year, one in the Bay Area, which attracts over 15,000 people, and one in Europe with over 3,000 SaaS executives, founders, and entrepreneurs. Before Saastr, Jason was the CEO and co-founder of EchoSign, which he grew to over 100 million ARR and then sold to Adobe where he ended up as a vice president of their web services business. If you follow Jason on Twitter or LinkedIn, you know how much wisdom he has to share about all aspects of building a successful SaaS business. 

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, we focus on what I find most product leaders have the least experience in, building a sales team. We get very practical and tactical on how long you should wait to hire your first salesperson, what your one to two first hire should look like, why you should actually hire two salespeople, not just one initially, how to comp them, how to interview them, when it's time to hire a VP of sales, how to avoid your salespeople flaming out and burning through all your cash. We also get into how to make the product and sales relationship healthier, including how to push back on sales and feature requests, why your head of product should be super involved in your sales process, how long you should make your trials, why you should avoid annual contracts, and so much more.

(00:02:09):
Jason also shares advice for running a conference, which I found super interesting. This episode went long because I just couldn't stop asking Jason questions, but as a result, I'm excited to bring you this incredibly rich episode on building your sales team. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow this podcast in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. This helps tremendously and I really appreciate it. With that, I bring you Jason Lemkin after a short word from our sponsors. 

(00:02:36):
Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product popups really annoying, "Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature." These popups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say, they just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing, and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. 

(00:03:10):
They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. 

(00:03:59):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Comm, Quora and Modern Treasury trust Vanta to help build scale, manage, and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, and many more, Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders. 

(00:04:36):

Jason Lemkin (00:05:03):
Hey, I'm so excited. Long time. What's the expression? Long time fan, first time dialer or something?

Lenny (00:05:03):
Caller? 

Jason Lemkin (00:05:09):
First time caller, yeah, first time caller. 

Lenny (00:05:10):
First time guest. 

Jason Lemkin (00:05:11):
I don't know if that exists in 2024 or not, but yeah, that's me. So thank you so much for letting me come.

Lenny (00:05:16):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I feel like you're the kind of guy that I knew would be on this podcast eventually, and I'm glad that we're finally doing this. I also feel like we can go in so many directions. I feel like you have so many insights on so many parts of building a business, especially a B2B business, but I thought it would be most interesting to dive deep into building your sales team, essentially trying to help people figure out how to start their sales team, scale their sales team, and all the elements they go into it. How does that sound?

Jason Lemkin (00:05:46):
I think it's great. I think it's an evergreen topic, but I think there's remains a consistent set of confusion, fears around how to build a sales team, and it's evergreen. The tools change and the pace has changed, but the issues, I love to dig into them because we keep making the same mistakes as founders and executives again and again and again.

Lenny (00:06:09):
100% agree. It's such a black box to me. Sales, I've never done sales, and I'm always just like, "I have no idea what's going on here." So this is how I learned from folks like you. You touched on this now. Now, I wasn't going to get on this, but I think it'd be interesting just this question of, does everyone need a sales team? Will you need a sales team if you're listening as a founder? Is it simply, if you're a B2B business, you'll need a sales team? How should people think about, "Will I need a sales team?"

Jason Lemkin (00:06:34):
If you truly build a self-serve product, you can either never have a sales team or Slack defer it or Canva really defer it. Canva didn't really build a sales team until they were well north of 500 million in revenue because it's epic self-serve. Slack started all self-serve, and by the time they went public, the majority of their revenue was enterprise sales. So you can sequence things. You can have hybrid models like a third of Asana's revenue is still from self-serve, and two-thirds are from a self-serve motion. So there's all different hybrid things. 

(00:07:06):
The most important thing though I've found is however you get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, be honest, be honest, and if you've talked to them as a founder and you know that they need a sales type motion, they need effort to deploy it, they have questions about security, they have questions about competition, they have onboarding requirements, and you say, "Hey, I don't like sales, so I'm going to do a PLG motion," you'll fail.

(00:07:34):
One of the things that I've done with so many founders over the years, and it shocks them at first, is your first 10, 15, 50 unaffiliated customers, the ones that find you from the ether, they're the next 50, 100, 200, 1,000, and you can either embrace them or run for them. Too many producty founders find that, "Hey, gosh, I'm going to have to do sales," and they exit it. They exit it. 

(00:08:00):
I'll tell you a company I invested in 18 months ago when things were easier, maybe 20 months ago, they were doing 5 million in revenue, growing over 100% with the sales like motion. Things got harder, things got harder as they did for many of us, and they decided to fire the whole sales team, and now they're doing less than one from 5 million with beloved customers. If I told you the logos, your jaw would drop. Over 5,000 20 months ago to 1 million today because they fired the sales team because the founders didn't like sales, they thought it was icky, they didn't want to do it, they were tired of doing it. I can tell you several stories like this. 

(00:08:34):
So you've got to be honest about the ... Sometimes we get it just right on day zero. Sometimes we know exactly how our company is going to work or Lenny's podcast is going to work. We can predict the future perfectly, but I find in B2B, a lot of times the industry, we end up winning. The segment of the industry, the type of customer is not what we initially thought and either lean into it and be a success or run from it because sales is icky and risk failure.

Lenny (00:09:00):
When you talk about being honest, what you need to be honest about is that you need sales help to close customers?

Jason Lemkin (00:09:07):
Be honest about that. Just be honest about, yes, the motion that it will take to get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, and if they were able to find you by putting their credit card and no one had to talk to them, then that's your DNA today. It doesn't mean you won't go up market later like a Slack or a Canva, but if you can get them all to do that and you never have to talk to them, then get really good at viral loops, get really good at almost B2C type motions, get really good at this kind of stuff and hire growth hackers and do the whole almost B2C-ish motion, which we have at self-serve, but if your first 10 customers come in and say, "You know what, Lenny, I'll pay you $5,000, but you've got to solve this problem I have with online video," that is not a self-serve motion. It is not a self-serve motion.

(00:09:51):
Even worse, sometimes worse is your first 10 customers, five of them sign up online, but it takes a huge amount of effort for 19 bucks a month, and then five say they'll pay you $5,000 a month. Some founders are like, "I'm going to work on the five that pay us 20 bucks a month, not the five that'll pay us $5,000 a year." I find too many folks that don't like sales, too many folks that have not had any life experience in a sales-led environment flee from those customers, and I've never seen that lead to success. We're surprised who our niche is sometimes. We talk about nailing our niche, but sometimes we're surprised that niche that finds us.

Lenny (00:10:28):
There's a lot of startups I've invested in that start off product-led growth and quickly realized, "This just isn't working," and many of them move to, "We need to actually hire salespeople and start to go top down."

Jason Lemkin (00:10:40):
Most companies are a hybrid. Even there's weird hybrids like there's folks like Mongo and Snowflake. Mongo has, well, maybe Mongo's much better example, Mongo has a free low end version, and there's open source too. It's a little confusing, and then there's not a lot in the middle, and then there's a lot of big. There's all different ways to combine a product-led or self-serve motion with sales-led. Too many founders in the beginning think it's either or. It's not either or. 

Lenny (00:11:06):
So I think the big takeaway here is sales is not a question of if you're going to need a sales team, it's a matter of when. The Canva example is crazy. Maybe that's the [inaudible 00:11:16]

Jason Lemkin (00:11:16):
But they still have one. But they still have one now. 

Lenny (00:11:18):
They still have one. I think Notion, I think at 10 million ARRs when they hired their first salesperson.

Jason Lemkin (00:11:23):
That makes sense.

Lenny (00:11:23):
So I think the question that leads to is, what is a sign that you should start to hire your first salesperson?

Jason Lemkin (00:11:31):
Even if you hate sales, even if you think it's icky, even if you don't like it, as a founder you've, 95 times out of 100, you've got to find a way at least to close the first 10 customers yourself. You've got to find a way. We could dig into how to do that if you don't like sales. The hack though is that even if you don't like sales, customers love to talk to the CEO. The customers love it. Here's the other thing, as a founder, you're really good at the product in the market, hopefully even in the early days. So what's important is even if you don't know how to do outbound, even if you don't know how to send a cold email, even if you don't how to do any of this stuff, and even if you don't know how to ask for a check, even if you don't know how to open or close, almost all founders are A+ middlers, A+ middlers, A+ middlers. Before we started, you and I talked about podcasts and content, and immediately it was an A+ conversation. Maybe you don't know how to close a big sponsor, I'm just making that up, and maybe you don't know how to find one, but once you have someone in your spider web, letting the conversation, you and I just had was A+, and any founder should be there by day one, by day one, and prospects love it. 

(00:12:40):
If I want to buy CRM, I don't get to talk to Yamini at HubSpot or Marc Benioff, but I get to talk to you and your CRM company. It's magical for early adopters. So bear in mind, no matter how bad you think you are as a founder, you're pretty good at the middle part of sales. So find a way to get any prospects, get really good at the middle, and then work up your courage. Work up your courage, and find how to ask for next steps and money. What would it take, Lenny? How can we get going on Riverside? What would it take? We would love to have you. What would it take to get you going next week? You've got to learn that little motion, but you don't have to learn all the stuff you think is smarmy other than how to go from middle to just ask for how we can get going.

Lenny (00:13:19):
I like this term, middlers. So just to make sure I understand what that means, in the middle of the conversation, you're not great at initiating, you're not great at closing, but you could talk about it.

Jason Lemkin (00:13:27):
Yeah, and this is where sales reps are terrible. Most sales reps, once you go beyond the five basic questions, they can't tell you how a database works or how to eliminate hallucinations from your product or how to do payroll in Eastern Southern Guam. The sales rep, and we can talk about this, they need help. They need help from the founders in the early days. They need help from sales engineers or product people, which is my favorite place to get the help as you scale, but they need help. 

(00:13:56):
The beauty to founders is they don't need help in the middle. You can be 10 times better in the middle than any sales rep at your bigger competitor. If you're running, I am just making up CRM, but if you're running a new CRM startup, you can run circles around 98% of the sales reps at Salesforce or HubSpot. They have the brand, they have the partners, they have the integrations, but they cannot answer the questions you can answer.

Lenny (00:14:21):
Okay. So you close the first 10 customers. What are other signs that, "Okay. Now is really the time we need to start hiring sales"?

Jason Lemkin (00:14:26):
I think as soon as you've got those 10 customers and more than 20% of your time is booked up with customers, you need leverage. You need leverage. You've got to get ... If you do it too early, if you're not spending 20% of your time in sales and 20% of your time in recruiting, you're failing as a founder. You need 20% of each, 20% in sales and 20% recruiting. Nothing else really matters at some level as a CEO, maybe not as founders, but as CEOs. Once you cross the 20%, you need leverage or your calendar will die. So you need to hire one rep and you've got to hire two because otherwise, there's no A-B test. You have to A-B test humans. You have to A-B test humans. You've got to hire two as hard as it is, and there's just one cheat code to those first two. There's one cheat code. 

(00:15:13):
I talked to so many founders that screwed up their first sales hires, and they always nod when they hear it. Those first couple reps have to be people you would buy your own product from. That's it. Now we can talk about other criteria. We can talk about normalizing for deal size. We can talk about industry expertise. We can talk about all this kind of stuff, but when you go out as a first time founder and interview 30 reps, and you're going to have to interview 30, and 20 are just going to break your brain because they don't do any work and they don't do any prep and they didn't even go to your website. Then eight of the next 10 are okay, but you know it's not really going to work, but you might hire them if you get tired.

(00:15:50):
If you're lucky, one or two of them, they're like magicians. They ask the right questions, which we could talk about. Then take a pause and say, "Look, no matter how strange their background was, whatever they did, it's not the right background. It's not our same deal size. It's not our industry. They actually weren't very good at their last job. They got let go at their last job, but I would buy from Lenny. I know. I've been doing this for a year. Every day, I would buy from Lenny because Lenny just explained to me my product and my customer's problems in a way that I actually believe. Forget about what's on her LinkedIn or his LinkedIn. I would buy from Lenny." 

(00:16:23):
That rep always works because you can trust them with those leads. Almost every first time founder hires someone because they worked at Twilio or CloudFlare or wherever, and they talk the talk and they can say ACV and NRR, and they can talk all these acronyms. None of which matter. None of which matter. We all get attracted to logos on our resume, but in our gut, I always ask them, "Did you know that Jason was going to ... Would you buy from Jason?" They're like, "You're right. I wouldn't have bought from Jason, but he worked at Twilio." So just wait, wait and interview 30 sales reps, however you find them through LinkedIn, through use recruiters, use contingent recruiters. It's exhausting. Do everything. Work your network and then be flexible in the beginning. We're looking for pirates and romantics in the early days. We are not looking for folks with massive sales operations teams and enablement teams. You're looking for that quirky one that's got a few extra IQ points, that for reasons that make no sense has fallen in love with your little product that is so feature poor and does nothing, but they love it, they love it, they love it. 

(00:17:28):
My first rep I had this back in the day, he had gotten let go by a prior startup and he was struggling and he was living in his brother's garage at the time. This was not your number one person at Snowflake, but of all the 30, he came in and what's now Adobe sign? EchoSign. He described the whole problem. He described how we would solve the problem for our customers in the early days of this category. It was clear, whatever it took we needed him and whatever we needed to backfill the garage or whatever, this was the only one that could sell the product, and he did it for a decade. Closed our first five-figure deal, first six-figure deal, first seven-figure TCV deal. Didn't scale completely. Inside of Adobe was harder to scale inside of a 20,000 person company than it was in a six-person company, but he was still there. He still made that far to the journey, but he was the only one that I knew that I would buy my product from, not that I would buy something from, but I would buy my product from. 

(00:18:24):
Leads are so precious in the early days. It's so hard to find leads. That's the problem. You hire this perfect person from Snowflake and you have three leads a month and you give him two and he doesn't close them, your company's going to die. Leads are so precious. That's what folks don't get. So wait, and I know it's painful, and I know most founders have hired this person with the right LinkedIn that they wouldn't buy their product from. Just keep interviewing. You need that quirky pyromaniac that loves your product and can sell it. They're out there.

Lenny (00:18:57):
Amazing advice. Wow. There's so much there. I'm going to follow a couple threads there. In terms of the level, I know a lot of people make the mistake of going with a VP of sales pretty quickly. What's your advice? I know you talked about general attributes, but what's your advice for the level and seniority of these first two hires?

Jason Lemkin (00:19:14):
Two things, one that's evergreen and one that's maybe especially apropos for today's environment. The evergreen one, which I've talked about for over a decade, and I think folks that have been through it will see it, which is you need two sales reps hitting quota closing deals before you're ready to hire a manager for them. Almost all VPs of sales, their job is to take you from rep three to 300, to take you from three to 300, to take something that's just starting to repeat, a script that's just starting to work, leads that are just starting to come in. Then take Lenny and Jason, the two reps I have, as quirky as they are, they're crushing it. 

(00:19:55):
Then I'm going to hire a more heterogeneous type of person going forward. I'm going to hire the person from Cloudfare. They can't all be like Lenny and Jason, they're pretty quirky, but at least I can learn from them. What's working? What are the objections? How do we get around that feature gap? We're one year old, we're two years old. We've got a lot of feature gaps. This integration doesn't quite work. How do we box around those issues? How do we sell our 10x feature? Because if you're a startup, your product isn't very good, your software is not very good, and you have a competitor, but you have some 10x feature that is driving people to buy you something you're doing that does not exist in the marketplace.

(00:20:29):
The really good reps get insanely good at selling that, and the folks off the street, the new VPs often doesn't even understand the 10x feature. It's too subtle. It's too subtle. Why? The fact that your product is localized in Portuguese magically means you can win these deals. I'm making up something that doesn't quite make sense. So you need two reps that are hitting quota and then you hire VP of sales. If you hire it before then, you're doing a Hail Mary. It ain't going to work. It never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever works. You're asking them to find product market fit to be the first rep, to be the second rep and scale it all at the same time. It's mission impossible to do all four at the same time. 

(00:21:09):
So that's the biggest mistake is, Lenny, I can't get sales going at my company. I can't do it, but I raised $4 million in my C+ round. I'm going to go out and hire the VP of sales. That VP of sales will not be there in eight months. You know what else? 2 million of the four will be gone because they'll never understand the product. They will never understand. There's so many things we could talk about, but if there's one thing I could reinforce for this audience, it's that early sales team, they've got to be product gurus for your product audience. They've got to be product experts. Later as you scale, they can't be or you can't scale. 

(00:21:42):
When I started, when I came out of my own startup and started interviewing other folks, I remember I would interview a lot of folks at places like GitHub back in the day. I'd be like, "Do you have a technical background? Are you an engineer? Have you ever built any software?" They're like, "No, I don't. I don't know. I don't know," and I was like, "I was curious how you could do it," but GitHub was so well-established that it's 10 questions. It's 10 questions and grab a sales engineer. It's 10 questions and grab ... So you got to be really good at 10 and then you grab a sales engineer. That doesn't work in the early estate startups. So you've got to find these sales folks that are a bit of product savants and dropping the VP of sales in that isn't a product savant, which is a big issue. That's all mister or miss process. This is the issue. They're all mister or miss process.

(00:22:24):
So the second point I wanted to make, and I was on the fence for years of when you hire a VP of sales, do they need to carry a bag? Do they need to sell themselves or not? Does it matter? Does it matter? I wasn't sure for a long time. The reason I wasn't sure for a long time, it's not that you don't want a VP of sales carrying a bag. I do think a VP of engineering also should commit code. We can talk about that. 

Lenny (00:22:45):
Carrying a bag, meaning close sales themselves? 

Jason Lemkin (00:22:46):
Yeah, not just be a boss. 

Lenny (00:22:47):
Have a quota. 

Jason Lemkin (00:22:49):
Yeah, have a quote. The reason I was on the fence was because I was like, "Well, listen, in theory it's great, but let's say you're a hot startup and you want to go from two to six this year." So I want to add 4 million in new bookings, and let's say I can do 400K in quota per rep. That means I got to have 10 reps. She walks in with two. I'm at a race, aren't I? I got to hire eight in the next six months to hit my plan, and I got to put numbers on the board. If I'm going to out there as an individual contributor sales rep, I'm never going to hire eight people, am I? It's never going to happen. 

(00:23:20):
So I used to say I don't know if it matters, but what I've learned the last 18 to 20 months when everyone has gotten lazy, Lenny, everyone in tech has gotten lazy, is I see way too many VPs of sales that come in and never have any idea how to sell the product, never, never. They only want to be managers.

(00:23:38):
Now, whether they carry a bag or whether what they do is they join calls with the reps, whether they backfill the reps, you want your VP of sales in deals 20, 30 hours a week when they start. I see VPs of sales today start, they're in no deals. I'll go to a board meeting and a VP of sales will be there two, three months, and they'll have a look on the board. I'm like, "How's it going with Airbnb?" and they'll be like, "I don't know. I got to ask John." Doesn't know because it isn't in the deal, isn't even in the deal. So I see this too often.

(00:24:08):
Another company I'm on the board on, I really like this VP of sales a lot. He joined and six months in, sales were down from where, the new bookings were down from where they were six months before. He was honest. He's like, "The biggest problem is I feel like I didn't have time to learn this product. It's a complicated product. It's more complicated than the product I last sold, and I just didn't have time."

Lenny (00:24:29):
Jason, this conversation is going exactly how I'd hoped. There's so much actionable advice here. Let me try to summarize a little bit of the things you've said and then keep going. So let me know what I'm missing here. I'm going to try to just highlight some of the important things you mentioned. So in terms of when it makes sense to start hiring your first salesperson, a couple of things you shared is you've closed the first 10 customers on your own as founders. If you're spending more than 20% of your time on sales and you need to start creating more leverage. I'll throw in one other thing I've heard and just to tell me if this is also true, that there's a repeatable process you've created. You can sell consistently enough or you can tell someone, "Here's how I've been selling." Is that right?

Jason Lemkin (00:25:08):
Yeah. If you hire a VP of sales before then, it's approaching 100% chance of failure.

Lenny (00:25:13):
I see. So you can hire the first two reps before you're like, "Here's a pretty good process that has worked for me a number of times."

Jason Lemkin (00:25:19):
Yeah. Listen, as hard as it is for a lot of founders to even get their arms around, the reason is you've got to be that crummy first head of sales with them. You've got to manage those reps. You've got to be in the field with them. You've got to be figuring it out before you can hire the person. You just have to even if you're terrible at it because you're still going to be a good middler. You're still going to be a good middler.

Lenny (00:25:41):
Okay. A few more things that stood out to me. One is hire two sales reps immediately, not just one. These reps you need to interview about 30 people. Eight will be pretty good, 20 will be terrible, and two, these are people that you can see selling your product and you would buy from them. They're often very quirky and not maybe a traditional sales background. They've never been VPs of sales, essentially. They're more like AEs and things like that historically or maybe not even salespeople historically. Is that right?

Jason Lemkin (00:26:10):
I think you will regret it if you don't hire these first couple of sales reps that have a couple years of experience if you're in B2B with B2B sales. They need a couple of years of experience and they need a certain amount of maturity, and maturity is a real issue, and these are in any early hire because we just don't have time to babysit people. There's no onboarding, there's no training. So they need a couple years of experience, ideally something close to your deal size, we could chat about why, that would be nice, and enough maturity that you can trust them with that lead. You can trust them with your customer.

Lenny (00:26:43):
Okay. Then you hire a VP of sales once you're ready to go from three to 300 reps. Your advice is also give the VP of sales a bag slash a quota slash they need to be doing sales themselves in today's world.

Jason Lemkin (00:26:56):
At least for a little while. More importantly, if they don't want to, I think in today's world you got to run from them. Exactly whether they fully carry a quota, a half quota, whether they backfill the sales team, you want a salesperson. Here's the thing, Lenny, you want a ... This is going to sound silly, but it's not. Trust me on this. For anyone watching, listening, you want a head of sales that actually wants to do sales. I got to tell you, and I'm still struggling with this myself after the last three years or so, so many folks in all functions, we could talk about other functions too, but especially in sales, don't want to do sales anymore. They don't want to do it. They don't want do it. 

(00:27:39):
2021 was crazy because everything was too crazy. There's too much money, too much going on. 2022 was the knife falling. That was crazy too. 2023 was just hard. Whether it's burnout or whatever out or just too much change, I would say I've probably interviewed for different reasons, 50 VPs of sales in the last 12 months, I would say the majority don't want to do sales. It's my first screening question. That's why they got to carry a bag because it proves they actually still care about the craft. 

(00:28:12):
The best sales folks love sales. It's a craft. They love money. Yes, they love money, and that does matter. Do not hire a sales rep that doesn't like money. Trust me on this one. There's 0% chance they'll work out either, but they also like the craft. They like honing the script. They like beating the competition. They like figuring out the counterfeit. They like figuring out the weapon and the 10x feature. They like working on a team. They like hunting. They love it, but then sometimes I just think burnout is always a reality, but I just think that the last three years have been so yo-yoed, that folks are just, they're out. They're out. Don't hire them no matter how smart they are, and that's the test. 

(00:28:52):
I'll tell you, I talked with a really great VP of sales candidate that had worked with a top 10 tech company and I asked him what he wanted to do in this next role. He's like, "I've got a great team. I've got eight people that I can bring with me. We're ready to lock and load." I'm like, "Okay. Well, let me tell you one of my views in today's world is that you've got to actually visit more customers now, not less. In a distributed world, it's more important to visit customers." He lived in the East Bay in Pleasanton in the East Bay, which is maybe 20 minutes east of Oakland. He said, "I'm willing to visit customers, but I won't go as far as the peninsula in San Francisco." He's just happy at home. He's happy at home, Lenny, and he don't want to sell.

(00:29:34):
This guy has the best LinkedIn and the best references, but he don't want to sell anymore. He needs a job. He wants to be a VP of sales. I see this across the industry and I'm struggling to find answers. I think the biggest hiring ... We talked about a lot of tactical hiring mistakes that you can make today in sales. The biggest strategic mistake you can make today in sales because there's so many veterans, there's so many folks that worked at Twilio and Mongo and wherever, pick any great company you want. There's so many veterans out there, you just can't hire the ones that don't actually want to sell anymore, and there's too many, there's too many.

Lenny (00:30:06):
You mentioned that you actually just asked them in the interview. The first question is, "Do you actually want to sell?" What other questions do you ask for either ... Let's go through both. You said you have these questions that you ask for the early hires and then the VP of sales. What are some tips for people when they're interviewing these folks?

Jason Lemkin (00:30:21):
It's interesting. VP of sales or VP of product, I look for the same answer. One of the Colombo style questions I ask them, and this is so odd. It barely even counts as a question is, what do you want to do your first 30 days? What do you want to do? Actually, I usually ask, "What do you want to do your first two weeks?" In B2B, if I don't hear from the VP of sales or the VP of product that I'm going to go meet customers, out, I'm out. There's too many VPs of product too, Lenny, that don't want to meet customers anymore either. The majority of VPs of products that I interview, they don't meet customers. Every single great VP of product, chief product officer I've ever worked with in my entire career, you know what the first thing they do in the first two weeks? They're like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone."

Jason Lemkin (00:31:00):
The first two weeks, they're like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, I'm going to go talk..." They don't want to sit out on meetings and look at PRDs and talk out of their navel on endless internal meetings. All the best ones, they say they just leave. They literally say, "Leave me alone. I will see you in two weeks. I'm going to go meet with 20 customers." And that's what products should do. Sales, whether it's prospects or existing customers, it can vary, but they should be like, "On my first day, I want to join five calls." 

(00:31:29):
And when you hear that story of, "I don't want to travel out of Pleasanton," or they say, here's what you're going to hear from the wrong person for anything, even up to 50 million in revenue, "I'm going to spend that first month working on process," "I'm going to spend that first month getting Salesforce up and running," "I'm going to send the first month on territory planning, Lenny, because we really, with our three reps, I really want to make sure we've nailed territories, right? Lenny will do the south, Elaine will do the east, Jason will do the west." 

(00:31:59):
When you hear process, process, process, from any, from marketing, product, sales, customer success, too, boy, it's the death of customer success. It's just... And it's not that you don't need process, it's just, it's even worse than it was than a few years ago. And I know this is going to trigger some people, but the truth is they don't want to work. They don't want to work. They don't want to work. 

(00:32:21):
I literally just got this LinkedIn email to work with me at SaaStr, from this person who'd been reading SaaStr for eight years. You're like, "I want to run account management, customer success for you. Here's what's, you're doing wrong, here's how to do it." I'm like, "Oh, this is pretty good." And I DMed her back, I'm like, "Great. To be honest, you realize that you're actually going to have to talk to customers and sponsors yourself in the beginning." No response. Just out. Just out. And that was the best one I got the last 30 days. That was the best inbound that I personally got. 

(00:32:51):
I know it sounds triggering or critical, but as founders, we have to be honest that there's this vast pool of veterans with great LinkedIns and great resumes that are so burnt out, Lenny. And let's not blame them. I know it sounds like I'm blaming them or being negative, and I'm trying to not be negative. I'm empathetic. I am empathetic to the burnout, but don't, you can't hire these. There's too many. 

(00:33:14):
The industry is littered with the burnt out. They're littered with it. And if you hear a touch of cynicism, if you hear anger, if you hear, "I don't want to meet customers in any..." and I'm going to say any VP role, product, sales, marketing, customers... If they don't want to meet customers their first, let's make it a 14-day test, you know they're never going to want to meet customers.

Lenny (00:33:33):
These folks that don't want to do sales that are VPs of sales, I imagine when you're further along, that's more, okay, because you don't need them to be doing sales, right? They want to manage, optimize. No. I see you shaking your head?

Jason Lemkin (00:33:46):
I mean, okay, you think, okay, there's an element, let's call it north of 50 or 100 million, where for, what's sometimes called commercial sales, SMB sales, it really is all process. Okay? So for sure, I agree. But at Salesforce, they're trying to close $100-million-plus deals. You think that the sales leadership doesn't need to be in those deals? You think they can just hit refresh on the dashboards and track them from home? No. Marc Benioff today is still flying to meet customers. He said the other day, why does Marc Benioff go to Davos? He sits, and I've never been to Davos. He sits at the same place, at the top of some staircase. Okay? 

(00:34:26):
And Salesforce drops millions of dollars, and he waits to meet customers, prospects, and partners in person all day, because it's efficient. Because it's efficient. Because he can do 50 or 100 customer or prospect meetings a day at Davos. He's still doing it at 30-something billion in revenue. Right? So this idea that, is there some truth at... For example, when I worked at Adobe back in the day, it is true that Adobe, which was, parts of the business, sales literally was dashboards. I get it. Okay, at four billion, 10 billion in revenue, but most of your audience is not ready to hire at four billion or 10 billion in revenue. They're not ready to hire that person. Don't hire them, right?

Lenny (00:35:08):
I don't know, maybe Satya's listening. You never know.

Jason Lemkin (00:35:12):
I think on the sales side of the business, they're flying out to the big deals?

Lenny (00:35:17):
To close the loop on this thread, when you're interviewing the early sales reps, those first two quirky folks, what are some questions and ways to know if there may be a good fit? You mentioned one of, you feel like you would buy from them?

Jason Lemkin (00:35:30):
Okay. The one, really, the simplest one, and early in my career, I thought this was silly or hated it, this Glengarry Glen Ross. I don't know if it was Glengarry Glen Ross or that toxic Leo movie about sales, which is still entertaining. Yeah, one way or another, Lenny, it's got to be, "Sell me this pen." But it's not "Sell me this pen," it's "Sell me this app." So I don't like surprises, I don't like games. I like to do this in a second interview or whatever. Give them time. And I don't like to judge too harshly, but whether it's the first interview or the second, they got to sell you this pen. They've got to put in the 30 minutes of work and maybe it's two hours.

(00:36:07):
But here's the thing, today's world, you can go on YouTube or someone's website... There's an explainer video for every product under the sun, isn't there? I am shocked how many salespeople I have met, Lenny, from SDR to SEB of sales that, by the time... And I'm doing an interview for a portfolio company, this isn't a screener interview, they haven't even watched an explainer video yet. I could be the fifth or eighth interview, and they don't know how the product works. They have not even gone to the effort of searching YouTube or the homepage and watching it. 

(00:36:38):
And forget about explainer videos enough. But so many companies do webinars now and they publish them on the... Really good stuff, customer testimonials. Right? If you're a sales rep, you don't actually have to know how the webhooks work or how to provision an API key, but you need to know the product as well as that webinar that's on YouTube. And 98 out of 100 folks won't bother in an interview. They won't bother. They're just going to click on "Apply" on the ATS and tell you, "Hey, I recently stumbled upon whatever. It looks like... Do you have time to discuss." Right?

(00:37:10):
But that one that actually does enough work and watches the video, and then can sell it to you, and they're going to make mistakes. They're not going to get it right, but they have enough confidence with the core problem to be solved. Because here's the mistake that 99% of founders and sales reps make. We're not really selling in B2B. We're solving problems. And this is why so many people are struggling in 2024, because they can't... their products, as sales reps, as companies, they can't solve big problems anymore. 

(00:37:41):
Our job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition. I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. And I'm going to help you understand, Lenny, because you're in the market for the car, why this is the best one. I'm going to be honest about where it's not. I'm going to answer all your questions. I'm such an expert, and then I'm going to ask you, Lenny, when is that... You have 280,000 miles on the Civic? Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. And I've even got a special discount for the end of this month. And let me just help you."

(00:38:14):
And I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I'm explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. And I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house, there's only supercharges. I got you, don't I? And that's the job of SaaS and sales, because we're not selling commodities. And that's why the best reps will also tell reps when not to buy their product. 

(00:38:41):
As painful as that seems in tougher times, in 2024, the best reps say, "No, we're not there yet. We're not the right... If you need this feature, if you need this integration, I want you back in six months when you use this big product that isn't that great. But today, we're not the right solution for you." That's, the best ones do that. They have the confidence to know to close it. And the rest of the world thinks this is some sort of adversarial transactional thing and it's not. Right? 

(00:39:07):
Software... I think hopefully all your audience would agree, when it's done right, software's magical. It solves incredible problems, incredible problems. What Airbnb does, what Uber does, what SaaS... Things solve... I can track my customers, I can manage, I can automate my communications. It's magical. You shouldn't have to use boiler room tactics and use [inaudible 00:39:30] tactics when you have something. But, it doesn't sell itself, except for a little while in late 2020, early 2021, that screwed the whole world up when products actually sold themselves.

Lenny (00:39:42):
I feel like this is a separate podcast we should do of just how to get better at sales and how to sell. But, I feel like that's its own hour of conversation. I did a great episode with April Dunford where, I don't know if you follow her stuff, but she-

Jason Lemkin (00:39:54):
Yes. 

Lenny (00:39:54):
... essentially describes exactly your approach of help people understand the market, help them understand the entire landscape, and then talk about your problem. So anyway, we'll link to that episode. Has a lot of good advice there. In terms of this interview, selling-me-a-pen approach, to give people something very concrete to do. How do you actually set this up? Is it like, "Sell me your product," and then they put together a pitch for your team and they pitch you on a product?

Jason Lemkin (00:40:19):
I'll tell you, until the boom, until everyone in late 2020 got so desperate to hire anyone with a pulse, almost everyone in sales had to come and they had, during an interview process, they actually had to do the pitch. They would come and you used to do it in person with this screen. You can do it on Zoom now, it really doesn't matter, but do it for real. Do it for real, and everyone would see. And everyone in recruiting change, people stopped doing reference checks, they stopped doing these tests, and they would just hire warm bodies.

(00:40:51):
Late 2020, I can tell you a funny story in a second, and it was okay until it wasn't. And our hiring processes have not reverted back to pre-March, 2020, and I think it's failing founders left and right. I can't tell you, I would say 95% of the hiring I see out there, people don't do reference checks anymore, Lenny. And we can talk about when they work and when they don't, but no one does them. No one does them. You're going to invest so much... Forget about the salary, it doesn't really matter. So much time, your time, your leads, everything's so precious, to bring Jason into your company and you're going to go through all this recruiting process and you're not even going to do any reference checks? People don't even do reference checks.

(00:41:33):
And they don't, they stopped doing, "Do me this demo," because they were so worried the rep would go to Gusto or would go to Deal, or would go to remote. There was no time. I got to get... This SDR has 50 offers. Lenny, we got to hire this SDR with three weeks of experience. We've got to decide today. And that's the way, and hiring does not come back. If those hires bounce, not only is it bad for you, but it's a disservice to the... It's worse for the hire. I mean, that poor CloudFlare woman that blew up with the thing, there's so many issues there we could dig into, but it's all Cloudflare fault for hiring her. Okay, let's forget about that she didn't close a single deal. Okay, so objectively, in sales, should you retain your job in sales if you can't close a single deal? I don't want to get into some of the triggering things, but remember, if you hire someone and they fail, it's all your fault. She didn't know what she was getting herself into. No candidates can do enough diligence ever. There's not enough time. There isn't enough time. 

(00:42:32):
And this is true all the way to the top. And so, as an investor, a board member, it's funny, when I do interviews, I do this thing, I try to be the last interview sometimes, and the founders don't want me to do it. They want me to sell. I don't want to be the last one. And what I want to do is when, Lenny, you've decided to join Ellen at her startup, right? At the end, I said, "Look, Lenny, I've talked to Ellen, she loves you. You have the job. You've got the job. What I don't want you to do, Lenny is bouncing three months after. So let's slow down, let's talk about the questions you have on your mind, and let's have a safe space where we can make sure you're going to be happy and successful there." Right? 

(00:43:09):
And sometimes even the founders get mad at me for doing this, because sometimes, the candidate bails. But I'm like, "I know you're mad at me today, but it is your fault. A hundred percent your fault if any of your hires fail. Don't blame them. And I'm guilty of this. I get upset when people start and they don't give it their all or they don't do it. I mean, what if you hired someone for your podcast and they decided, "You know what? I don't want to do the podcast this week. I'm tired. I'll do it..." You're so mad at them, but you should've seen it during the hiring process. Right?

(00:43:44):
So, tying it back, that's why you've got to do this, "Sell me this pen." You've got to, before you hire the salesperson, have them sell your product real. Do the demo. And if they need more time, give them more time. Let them watch another demo. Don't have them feel like it's a trap or spook them. Treat them the way you would like to be treated. But if you skip this step, I mean, what's the point? You're not helping them.

Lenny (00:44:09):
What I love about this process is it connects exactly to what you recommended you look for in these hires is, "Would I buy my product from these people?" So this makes a lot of sense. And you give them this assignment at home and they do work on this and they come in, right? It's not like come to the office?

Jason Lemkin (00:44:22):
If you talk to a great transactional VP of sales that's hiring tons of reps that do it, they'll make them do... If they're still doing this, they'll make you sell the pen fast in the process. They don't have time. They're doing 20 interviews a week, 30 interviews a week, you've got to sell me this pen. But if you're a founder and I'm talking about you've already talked to a bunch of candidates, you're down to one or two, make them, tell them, "Look, this isn't a trick. I'm not that great at telling my product myself, but I got to know that you're going to be happy and successful here. So do a demo for me."

(00:44:49):
And if they won't do it, they're not a salesperson. And too many people went into sales, not... The other weird thing about B2B sales in good times is actually, a lot of these folks are not really what you might think as salespeople. They can't do outbound, they can't pick up the phone. All they know how to do is to manage leads that come in and say, "I want to buy today." And you need those people, too. Okay? And I'm not saying you don't need those people, too, but that's not always what we think of as sales.

Lenny (00:45:16):
Another black box for me, and I think a lot of people with sales, is comp and quota, had actually set up their comp for early hires, and then how to actually decide on a quota. What advice do you have for figuring that out early on? What percentage is commission, what percentage is salary? All that-

Jason Lemkin (00:45:31):
Yeah, everyone gets this wrong. We worry... Look, at scale, when you're extremely mature, extremely mature, and very profitable, you really got to tweak this stuff very carefully, and we could talk about that if it's relevant. But, in the beginning, we get this all wrong. What matters is, can a sales rep close more than they take home? In the very beginning, that's all that matters. It's just you selling, right?

(00:45:58):
The first three months of a new rep, you're lucky if they can close as much as their take-home pay is, their OT. And so, in the really early days, my early, early day comp plan is, look, your first three months, you keep a hundred percent of what you close. Of course, that's not profitable for the business, but you've got to invest in them, right? You keep a hundred percent of what you close. And if you have enough going on in your business, usually, that's enough to put supper on the stove. 

Lenny (00:46:24):
And that's without a salary? 

Jason Lemkin (00:46:26):
No, no. You pick an OT, a salary, but you got to... Okay, let's step back for a minute. You got to pay market. You got to pay market. And in the early days, if you're bootstrapped or really lean, this stresses folks out. I just talked to this great rep, Lenny, but he wants 150k OTE. And in fact, it's a step down. He had 170k at Slack, but he knows this isn't a startup. He wants 100. He might take 140.

Lenny (00:46:53):
And OTE is total comp, overall total comp.

Jason Lemkin (00:46:54):
Total comp. And the founder panics. "I don't have, I'm only making 60. How can I pay 140?" Well, let's break it down for a minute. First of all, let's be tactical. It's usually 50/50, right? 50% base, 50% bonus for a sales rep. So they're really only taking home a 70k base, trying to make another 70. Okay? Then 70 divided by 12, help me do my math. It's not quite 6k month. Well, maybe with taxes it is. You're really only paying 6k a month for a couple months to see if this experiment works out. You're investing 20,000, you don't have $20,000 to do sales? Then don't do sales, if you can't find $20,000. So people freak out too much about this comp-line number, this base and bonus, the on-target earnings, OTE, and they're not more practical about what am I committing to cash upfront? 

(00:47:44):
Two, you need a plan where it's a win-win. So if this person makes 140, but ultimately, a sales rep's got to bring in four to five times what they take home. That 140's got to be 500, 600 or more. The more enterprise you are, the bigger the multiple has to be, and the higher the comp. But it's got to be 3x to 5x at a minimum, 3x for small businesses, 4x for mid-market, 5... You got to get there, but you don't have to be there on day one and two. When you get there, the reps should be accretive, shouldn't they be? If they make 150 and they bring in 450, unless your marketing costs are out of control, which can happen, but that's not sales fault is it? If your marketing costs are reasonable and you pay a sales rep 150 for closing 450, if you engineer your plan right, you should be smiling, not frowning.

(00:48:34):
Where it gets tough is when you have a ton of folks not closing. When you have a ton of folks not closing and you have extremely high marketing costs, then it all breaks. Your cap breaks, your payback period breaks. But, if you have inbound leads, if you have demand, and you have sales reps that can sell you this pen, they're going to be accretive, Lenny, because of that math. And take the pressure off, don't make them close 5x their take on their first quarter, make them close 1x. Let them put points on board, let them eat. And so negotiating, here's the point if you think about it. Negotiating someone down from a 150k OTE to 130, it's not going to make any difference. You want them to close 600 or 700. It's not going to matter. 

(00:49:15):
At scale, does it matter? For Mongo maybe. Maybe. But, what you care about is how much more can they close and they bring in? And then you, that's why you want them to make a lot of money. You want them to be rich. You want them to take home a lot for a whole bunch of reasons. And so, don't freak out about the acronym OTE, what they take home. Figure out what it's really going to cost you and would you buy from them? And if you would, they're probably going to bring in more than they take home. Right? And on the marketing side, in early days, you're lucky if you can find a marketing channel that is that accretive.

Lenny (00:49:49):
Amazing. Okay. So just to summarize, you start a sales person with, say, 75k in salary and then say 75k in expected sales. And they take-

Jason Lemkin (00:50:01):
Bonus, bonus.

Lenny (00:50:02):
Bonus.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:04):
Bonus from sales, yep. 

Lenny (00:50:05):
Bonus from sales and the the idea there is they take 100% initially of their sales, for the first month or two, just to make it feel amazing. They're making money. See how they're doing, don't put a lot of pressure on them. And then the plan is, over time, get it to a point where they're bringing into the business four to five times what they're taking home in terms of bonus.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:24):
Yeah, yeah. 

Lenny (00:50:25):
I set expectations every month or two, or is it every quarter? We're going to revisit your comp and quota and adjust.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:32):
If you get it right, you never have to revisit it. Not for years. I mean, I'm using the same sales comp plan I have for a lot of years. It still works. Listen, you can make tweaks and you've got to listen, and we're all human beings. And people, and again, remember, your sales team has to eat. They've got to eat, okay? And you've got to be somewhat competitive. But, there's only so much you can tweak, Lenny. I mean, they have to bring, close more than they bring home. Right?

(00:50:55):
And so, you can make tweaks at the margin. The problem is if you make too many tweaks to this model, you burn up all the cash. You're trying to plug a leaky boat, there's no point. There's no point. There's no point. And remember, related to this, for a long time, for most folks, unless you're, even if you're hyper funded, you're better off with fewer, better reps than more reps.

(00:51:18):
There is a stage when you get big enough where this concept of capacity planning really does matter. Lenny, if I got to go from 50 to 100 this year, okay? I'm going to add 50 million. If each of my reps can do 500k, I need a hundred, don't I? Okay. And literally, if you have 20, you mathematically cannot hit the plan. So there's a certain truth at scale. In the early days, this is a rookie error. I'd much rather have two reps, each closing a million than 20 reps struggling to close 100k each. Culturally, it's terrible. There's no domain knowledge in the company. Everyone's miserable, everyone's fighting. 

(00:51:50):
What you want to do in the early days is concentrate your leads and your best closers, at the same time, bringing new people up. But you've got to concentrate your leads to your best closers. And that means year two, year three, year four, they should be making a lot of money. Lot of money, sometimes too much. I remember the first investment I ever made was a company called Pipedrive, which sold for a billion and a half. SMB CRM, and I put in the first sales rep there. He used to work for me. And the founders got mad at him. They got mad at him, because in three months, he was making more than any of the founders. They were pissed. 

(00:52:21):
I'm like, "Guys, I know we're have different backgrounds and cultures, but this is what you want." But it took them a long time culturally as self-serve... Because Pipedrive was 100% self-serve at the time. They'd never had a sales rep. And I put the guy in, and what he did was he went and he looked, all these self-serve customers, he's like, this was the company was about two million revenue at the time. And he's like, "Okay, who's bought more than one seat?" He just did a reverse sort and he called them. 

(00:52:48):
I remember he called AOL back in the day and he's like, "You guys have 20 seats of Pipedrive. Would you like to buy more for your sales team?" They're like, "Thank you very much. We'll take 100 seats." And he just went down the list, from the top to the bottom, and he took home 20% of those deals. Now that difference, that extra 80 seats at AOL, he brought it in. So Kim, keeping 20% of that is a great deal for the company, right? But he was pretty good at it and he was the only person for a while, so he made hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars when the poor company, the founders were paying themselves 50.

Lenny (00:53:20):
So your advice there is don't be sad if your salesperson is making tons of money.

Jason Lemkin (00:53:25):
If you architect the simple sales fund we talked about, and they're making a lot of money, you're making a lot of money, and your equity is worth a lot of money, your equity is worth a lot of money. Right?

Lenny (00:53:34):
When do you make that switch from they're taking home 100% of what they're selling to smaller percentage?

Jason Lemkin (00:53:40):
Look, some people are going to think it's goofy what I said about 100. I just view it as a simple ramp. I think you do it for one quarter max. One quarter. The problem is if you let this go for too long, more than a quarter, if you make it too easy for long a quarter, the problem is the mediocre lean into it too much, and that doesn't help. And not only does it not help you, it doesn't help them. You don't want to make mishires. They're so damn... I mean, you could have a whole podcast only just on mishires. It's probably the single most important thing in scaling startups. It's not hires, it's mishires.

(00:54:12):
It's a tragedy if you mis-hire a rep, but you don't want them there six months. It's not good for them either. You want to support them, you want to help them find a place where they're successful. And here's the quirky thing on the mishires, and this is why that first guy I hired was mid-pack. He was less than mid-pack. Here's the thing about sales is, someone can be very good in certain sales environments and completely fail in other ones, completely fail. It's probably more binary than any other function. And so you got to find it before you hire them, but you also got to root it out fast, because those leads are too precious.

(00:54:44):
And it doesn't mean they won't go on to another company and be wildly successful, but you could utterly fail. And the one related point I'll give, if I had to throw one hint on this first, any of these reps, first 10 and VP of sales, one hint more than anything else, trust... got to hire someone whose last product was harder to sell. This is so important. This is a recipe for utter disaster. If you've, take someone in sales and their last product was easier to sell, they will have none of the skills to sell your product. But, this is the... and I'll give you an example in a second. 

(00:55:27):
If you hire someone from something that was just a smidge harder, a smidge harder to sell, and they come into your company, it's like they're on Mars. It's like weight has been released from their feet. They learned how to sell a harder product and get it done, and then they come to you. And the first example I had, the first SDR I hired was a guy named Sam Blond, who went on to be CRO at Brex, and then now is a partner at Founders Fund. We worked together from the very beginning, first SDR. And he came, before that, he was an SDR at a company called Intacct, which was bought for a billion, which was online financials. Okay?

(00:56:03):
And back in the day, we know what the one thing people didn't want to put in their cloud was? Their financial statements, okay? It just wasn't trusted that. There are some things you would trust to the cloud, like A CRM, but they'd be like, "These are my crown jewels. I can't put these..." So he went from desperately trying to convince folks to move a business process to the cloud. They had no interest. And he came to us, and it was hard, but it wasn't that hard. And he instantly was number one. He went from SDR to SMB-AE to mid-market AE to director of sales, to head of this whole sale... 

(00:56:31):
Because, I mean, there are many reasons he was great, but he came to me and I said, "Sam, why are you crushing it when everyone else here is struggling?" He's like, "This is much easier than Intacct." So hire someone like that and don't make... No matter how much you like them, the sell me this pen thing will control for it a bit, okay? But, when we give, we give, we give in the hiring process. We never give what we want. Be very, very careful if the last product was easier to sell.

Lenny (00:56:57):
I love this advice. What is a heuristic that the last product was harder to sell than yours? What tells you that that's probably true?

Jason Lemkin (00:57:04):
Be very careful if it was more technical, very technical. Some folks can go from a business process sale. They can go from selling a Gong or a sales software and outreach, and they can go sell a complicated API to VPs of engineering or VPs of product, but most can't. Okay? So more technical is a tough heuristic. More competitive is a positive. What really works, Lenny, is if you hire someone from the number four in the space and they did well. You take someone that was number four in the space and then you're number two in the space? You think number two's really hard because number one's crushing you? But they're at number four in a space where no one can tell the difference between these products? That's a great one, right? So a space that's more competitive, a space that is a positive, more technical.

(00:57:55):
The other one related to technical, on the pure B2B side, is much more complicated business process. I see folks fail in B2B when they've sold us... Yeah, it's hard, but they've sold a simple business process. They go to something that's got a lot of integrations, a lot of complexity, and a lot of business process change, and they just melt because it's too complicated. They just melt, right? There's a company I invested in, it's doing over 20 million today. And for some reason, to simplify what they do, which is pretty complicated, they called it the Gong for X. Okay? The Gong for X.

(00:58:30):
And it's great to get a VC meeting and a few other, but it's not even on their homepage, okay? It doesn't really make sense. And the CEO had me listen to this senior sales exec he hired, and the only thing he could tell the prospect was that they were Gong for X. And the prospect kept asking, "Well, how does this deep integration with this business process flow and Zendesk works, and how does this go over to Salesforce?" He's like, "Well, we're Gong for X." That $600,000 deal was lost. Right? 

(00:59:00):
But, maybe that works in some space, right? And Gong's hard to sell today, too, don't get me wrong. But you see my point, it's just that simplicity, it's too complicated, right? And I know it's not the perfect heuristic, other than this technical thing, but the technical one, man, trust me. Too many B2B type reps melt in B2D. They just melt. They just, selling to VP of eng is a different... It's the same beast, but they don't suffer fools, do they? Not the VP of engineerings I'm close. They don't suffer fools.

Lenny (00:59:32):
I haven't heard this term, B2D before, business to developers. 

Jason Lemkin (00:59:35):
To developer, yeah. 

Lenny (00:59:36):
I imagine that what it stands for. Oh, interesting. Haven't heard that term before. Okay, let me zoom out a bit and I want to move on to a different topic. But before we do that, so we've talked about kind of these early days of hiring your first two reps, getting your VP of sales to help scale out the team. To give people a sense of where this goes, as the business scales, what does the org evolution look like? You have these two reps doing sales on their own, then you have a manager. What does it look like over the next couple phases of the sales org?

Jason Lemkin (01:00:03):
Look, to simplify, there's rules of eight. So in sales, I'm actually not sure what the tip of heuristic is in product, because product teams are leaner, at least I hope. I like it when they're leaner. But the thing about sales is there's no efficiency. If you have a sales-led motion, half your company is going to be in sales at 10 millionaire, half your company is going to be in sales at 50, half your company is going to be in sales at 100. 

(01:00:27):
One of the tough parts of the software model is that there's no, there's actually almost anti-efficiencies in sales. The public companies are actually less, they have the higher CACs than startups, believe it or not, because they have so much market penetration. So you're going to need a lot of people. And it's rules of eight, eight SDRs, outbound reps need one manager, eight AEs, eight sales execs need a director above them.

(01:00:51):
And then when you really scale, eight directors. You don't really ever going to have eight directors, but eight directors could have a VP or eight reports. And so there's rules of eight. If you want to build an organization on it, it's all rules of eight. For a while, for SDRs, thinking this was this high velocity entry-level position, people pushed it to 12. But the more folks I talk to today, the more I hear, everyone's reverted to eight. I'd rather have fewer SDRs, having better conversations. And so it's just, you can build your whole org with eights.

Lenny (01:01:21):
That is way too easy of an answer. So the idea there is you hire this VP of sales, then you hire six more sales reps, AEs. So what happens next? You hire another-

Jason Lemkin (01:01:32):
Got to start hiring managers.

Lenny (01:01:32):
Manager, got it. Yeah. 

Jason Lemkin (01:01:33):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:01:34):
And then you scale eight more reps.

Jason Lemkin (01:01:35):
And once you have eight AEs scaled, you almost always are going to start, a VP's going to already... A good VP of sales already be hunting two directors.

Lenny (01:01:44):
Two directors. 

Jason Lemkin (01:01:45):
Whether they're just split up normally, whether they're east, west is a classic way. Another way, you might have smaller and larger customers. That's pretty standard, right? Commercial and enterprise. But a good VP of sales, once you have, she or he has eight reports, will be bringing in two directors, or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title-

Jason Lemkin (01:02:00):
... directors or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title inflation today, which doesn't bother me nearly as much as a lot of other things we've chatted about. I don't care what your title is if you'll actually do sales or do work, but yeah, we need to bring in managers at 8:00. And folks that can, also, a related point is, a lot of founders were, "When will my ... " I really love my head of sales, but she's a stretch. Most of them should be stretches.

(01:02:25):
If you hire the seasoned one, they're not going to work, so for 95 out of 100 of us, our first head of sales should be a stretch VP of Sales. And what that means is, usually, they were a director before that or a senior director or sort of a VP, okay? But you should be cautious about hiring your first VP of Sales for their first third VP of Sales gig. They're not willing to do the job anymore. You need a stretch and it's worth it for their career growth. It's worth it for their personal growth. It's worth it for the equity, right? So you're going to hire a stretch. That's an important tip right there. But then, you're going to be a little worried, how far can Lenny go? How far can ... I love Lenny, but he was a director for two years before this, and this is his first rule, and he did so good last year, but I'm worried Lenny's going to break. I'm worried Lenny's going to break.

(01:03:09):
And related to this quote, the simple answer is, Lenny will break if he can't source those directors under him. You can scale forever as a sales leader if you can hire better managers under you. And it's true of any functional area, but what you'll see in sales is, you'll see your stretch VP of Sales drown when they never can hire better managers under them, They'll end up doing some weird internal promotions, which you want, you want to do internal promotions. My rule is you want to promote 50% from within and hire 50% without for your managers, but if, really, the only people you can promote are just junior people on your team, you can't find leaders, you can't scale. I do see this happen too frequently is, a first time out of sales, does it, and then, they're like, "Here are my managers, Lorraine and Jason, but they really were just reps for two years and they don't know how to do it." So you have a whole bunch of people who don't know how to do it. That's when the organization cracks.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2x to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in.

(01:05:11):
Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(01:05:26):
There's these terms that we throw, around account executive reps. It might be helpful just to give people a sense of what does this actually mean when someone's an account executive. Is it that they're just sitting there calling and doing sales directly? Whatever the key terms are for the roles or the title might be helpful to quickly summarize.

Jason Lemkin (01:05:42):
Yeah, I think the two ones that are probably less obvious for folks that are new are SDR, Sales development representative, and AE, account executive.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Okay, great.

Jason Lemkin (01:05:49):
And SDR is, generally, although I wish it wasn't, it is generally an entry level position, often fresh out of school, generally paid on the order of 60K to 80K, OTE and SaaS and US-based SaaS, and their job is to email for dollars, dial for dollars, and in many cases, to screen, to screen inbound leads. It's entry level, and their job is to pass on a lead to a sales executive, an account executive, an AE. Not all companies have SDRs. It's a longer topic, but pretty much all the best teams have some type of SDR function now because we've learned we want to specialize. We want openers opening and we want closers closing, so that's the rough idea.

(01:06:34):
SDRs are openers in some cases, and account executives are the more seasoned folks closing. And it varies, compensation from account executives that are US-based could be anywhere from like 90K to 200K, depending on, that's with base and bonus split at 50/50, depending on whether they're hunting tiny deals or big ones. That's the way an account executive works. And I think what doesn't happen today ... Those are the acronyms, SDR and AE. I think people can figure out VP of Sales, that's vice president of sales.

(01:07:03):
I think a thing that's gone on in the industry that founders expect now because there's so much discussion of it on LinkedIn and social media, but I haven't found work, is that an account executive will magically be full stack. They will do outbound themselves, they'll go use ZoomInfo and Apollo and develop a list themselves, they'll manage that outbound list themselves. If they don't have enough inbound, in their free time, you know what they'll do, Lenny, in their free time? They'll just do more outbound. You know what sales reps do in their free time? Today, they sell real estate or courses.

(01:07:36):
If you want a tip, for founders, I know you want this full stack AE, and they do exist when they're micromanaged in certain high performance sales organizations, but they don't exist in real life. They're specialized. Most AEs, they want to be closers, they want to be handed a lead, a contact me, a lead. They want to work the lead and close the lead, and you hire some SDRs to help generate more demand. Those are the basic acronyms. What's hard for most founders, here's the tough part, most founders have enough stamina to manage a couple of these AEs, these account executives, these folks who work the leads. Most founders do not have the stamina to manage 10 kids fresh out of college that need to be micromanaged on an hourly basis to call leads. Very, very few founders themselves can manage a team of SDRs, but if you can, it's like a superpower.

Lenny (01:08:28):
That was really helpful. I did not know what exactly these terms represented, and when you're hiring those first two reps, they should be at the account executive level.

Jason Lemkin (01:08:37):
Yes. And they'll do some outbound and they'll do some of this SDR work. It's just, ultimately, people end up specializing.

Lenny (01:08:43):
What is the title for someone above the account executive? Is it Director of Sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:08:46):
Yeah. There's really no ... It's a meta topic. I wish there were another career path for these ICs. This does exist in product, it does exist in engineering. It should exist in sales, but the truth is it doesn't. There is no senior SDR for this outbound. And for this AE, this person closing, yes, you can go more enterprise and make more money, but there isn't really a senior AE track, but there should be. It's unfortunate. It should be.

(01:09:15):
Too many of these folks are looking for, they look to go into management for promotion when what they really should look for is to be a super IC, and it's a shame that more folks don't try to implement a super IC role in sales, but that's basically what the career path is in management. And that's why another tip, another mistake that founders often make is, they hire the number one account executive at a hot company to be their head of sales. It's not the same skills. Most sales executives should not be managers. They don't want to be managers. They want to be individuals. They want to be highly paid individual contributors, these days, that mostly work from home and make a lot of money working 30 hours a week. That does not naturally breed great management skills.

Lenny (01:10:02):
I want to shift directions a little bit and talk about product and sales. A lot of listeners of this podcast are product managers or founders building products. How involved should product managers be in sales. And vice versa, how involved should sales be in the roadmap and what's being built?

Jason Lemkin (01:10:19):
I think, in the best run B2B organizations that I've worked with, and my own as well, the great, at least the head of product, the VP of Products, are deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. A company I invested in that's just crossing $60 million, they just had a meeting with who will be their largest customer. And the head of product who was there at the board meeting is like, "Thank God I was there because what they want to do with our product, we sort of do. We sort of." Now, the product does do it, but what they want to basically do is deconstruct the product. They don't actually want to use the backend and analytics and some other pieces, but they don't really need the front end of the product. If the head of product hadn't been there, that deal would've been lost. It would've been lost.

(01:11:11):
An AE doesn't know that. Even if an AE did know that, a sales rep did know that even. If the VP of Sales didn't know ... A VP of Sales would not be empowered enough to stand up in a meeting and say, "I know what you want. We can launch tomorrow on this and, in 90 days, we'll tweak the UI so it does exactly what you want." You want that in your big deals. If you have that magical VP of Product that truly owns the roadmap, owns it and has the gravitas for that meeting, they become like the mini CEO in these meetings. A lot of CEOs, at scale, I've talked to, I was just talking with Daniel Chait at Greenhouse, he does this, they're over $200 million, when they have that head of product, they divide and conquer with the big customers. And the CEO can do some and the VP of product can do others.

(01:11:52):
And sometimes, the VP of Eng, if they're very producty, can also do that role too. Sometimes, you get these three weapons. In the old days, sometimes, your VP of Customer Success could do this, but unfortunately, and I know this is going to trigger some people, I don't see customer success stepping up for this pseudo product role anymore and I see them shrinking more and more into process. But that magical VP product, they give you that scale, that CEO level scale.

(01:12:17):
Can a product manager or a director do that? In my experience, the best ones, absolutely. The mid-pack ones that are working on the color of the pixel, I'd rather not have them in the deal. You have to be utterly fluent in the product, the entire product. You have to be the one that knows how to connect the pieces that don't ought to always connect themselves, and you have to have the gravitas to work with a large customer, to make commitments. That deep knowledge and commitment, it's hard below the VP level, but if it does exist, I love it. They become one of the greatest strategic weapons of a B2B company is bringing the product team, because the VP of Sales never quite goes that deep and can't make the commits, and the CEO can't be everywhere.

Lenny (01:13:04):
The bane of many product managers' existence is the flip side of sales is involvement in product. Do you have any advice for how you've seen the best SaaS companies handle requests from sales going into product, how product teams should think about requests from sales and making that work?

Jason Lemkin (01:13:21):
I think this one is so simple and I'm surprised people make it so complicated. I know we all release 28 times a day, but the reality is, software still goes on quarterly release cycles no matter what we say, okay? Your customers cannot process 88 releases a day, okay? The maximum a customer can process is two big releases a year and maybe quarterly, so let's simplify. That's how customers think. Forget about how we build software.

(01:13:46):
Every quarter, give your head of sales a certain budget, whether it's story points or 10% of the pie chart, however you do it, give them a budget. And when you do this, things will radically change then. They radically change because even the best VPs of sales, they change the wind. On Monday, what they really need is the HubSpot integration. And they're like, "Oh, my god. We weren't going to do that for two years, but I guess we could change everything on Monday," but then, on Wednesday, a new prospect comes in and, "We need SAP, but we just spent two days spec-ing out." You need SAP. And then, on Monday, it's Salesforce, right? And it's not that sales isn't honest, it's just, the big deals, the big ones always, the tail's wagging the dog and it burns out the organization. Even with the best sales leaders, I find it burns out, especially because the stressful deals, they overreact, and as good as they are, they're not product people, so they don't really know how to prioritize and force rank. If you say, "Okay, Lenny, my VP of Sales, great. HubSpot, SAP, whatever you want, you've got 10% of the budget, you've got a hundred story points, whatever metric or heuristic you use, but you've got to decide now each quarter." And if you want to change during the course of the quarter, if you want to disrupt our whole engineering product team, you can do it, but understand there's a high cost, and the later you do it in the quarter, the less successful it's going to be because we already started the HubSpot integration. Not only will it demoralize the team, but we're going to run out of ... You already used your budget.

(01:15:10):
I just don't see enough product leaders being objective here, saying, "Listen, here's your budget. You get it, period. No one can take it from you. I guess the CO can steal it if she really wants to, but it's yours, VP of Sales." And they will do the low balancing across their team. They will do it. They will listen and they'll say, "Maybe I don't need that HubSpot integration after all. Maybe." Right?

(01:15:32):
Because what a VP of Sales should be doing is taking ... The CO has to look five years into the future, product has to look about two years into the future, and you really can't ask a VP of Sales to look more than 12 months into the future because that's where they're next on the line, but a good one will load balance feature requests across the year and they will listen to all the ... Because they'll actually be in sales, they'll actually be in deals, and they'll be listening and they'll realize, look, even though we're going to lose this deal to HubSpot, I've gotten four SAP requests the last ... I'm going to take that bet. Even if I'm wrong, I'm going to take that bet. You got to give them that ... And you got to talk about it every week and say, "Look, here's your budget, Jane. Here's your story points, your whatever, your 10%. This is what we're building now for you, objectively, and this is what we're currently planning for the next two quarters. Would you like to change the ones for the next two quarters? Because we haven't committed any code yet, and if you really want to change what's in process, you can. Otherwise, it's going to be hyper disruptive," but you got to at least pretend to be objective, for sales.

(01:16:29):
If you're too emotional about it, you break the organization. You've got to say, "Listen, I know we've already written 80% of this upside integration. If you really need us to put us on the shelf and drop everything for a million dollar deal, we're a startup, we'll do it. But understand, just, is this really really what you want?" And if you involve them every week as a stakeholder, magic happens. But I don't see the VPs of Product that I work with, I know I'm not in all the staff meetings, but the meetings I'm in and the board meetings, I don't see this back and forth happening.

Lenny (01:16:58):
This might be the same exact answer you just gave, but say you're a PM and a salesperson comes to you, "Hey, we're about to close this deal. We just need this one feature. Can we just get this on the roadmap?," what's the best way to help that sales person understand why it's not happening, help them feel like, "Okay, I get it"? Is it exactly what just said? "Okay, we could change everything. Here's the story points you have this quarter."

Jason Lemkin (01:17:18):
Well, are you assuming that PM is the head of product or empowered enough to make the decisions?

Lenny (01:17:24):
I'd say, yeah, that PM could put something on the roadmap if they think it's important.

Jason Lemkin (01:17:29):
The reason I'm a little confused, just because I want to get it right, is what I'm hearing, which maybe isn't what you said. What I'm hearing is, a junior IC rep is talking to a more mid-level product person about the roadmap, and you want to have that. That's one of the reasons we actually go to the office. Because those discussions don't happen on Zoom, Lenny. They don't happen. And you want those discussions to happen, but you don't actually want them empowered. You want them to say, "Listen, I will talk to my boss." That's the right answer. It's too confusing.

(01:17:58):
This stress between product and sales is a good thing. It's a sign of a well-run B2B company when there is stress between product and sales. It's a good sign. If there's no stress, you're not in enough deals. You're not in enough deals if there's no stress. But the stress has to have enough process, even in a startup, that it doesn't break because your question alludes to the fact it can break organizations again and again. People get people resented on either side.

(01:18:27):
This is one thing where the answer has to be, "Look, we can chat about it over lunch. We can chat about this, and actually, you've got a good idea. You're an individual contributor. I'm going to tell my boss, on Monday, that I think we should do that. I'm going to use a little social capital and say we should do this," but you got to push the decisions up. That's as far as you're going to make recommendations. Otherwise, instead of that one stressful conversation with the VP, you've got a hundred, you've got 10 times a hundred, and again, they're fun lunch conversations, but they'll wreck you.

Lenny (01:18:54):
So the advice there is, basically, "Talk to your manager, I'll talk to my manager. They need to hash this out. It's not my call."

Jason Lemkin (01:19:00):
I think you got to push it up and I think you got to force the VP of Sales and the VP of Product to have this weekly meeting about the budget, and that will force them to have enough, just enough organization on their team so that it can all be surfaced up. Because that means they each have to have a meeting with their team for 30 minutes each week and say, "I'm going to put up on the whiteboard guys, so my sales team's going to say ... And I've been to many of these meetings where you force the sales team to force rank what they want and you end up, I tell you, Lenny, 100% of the time in the sales meeting, when you do a whiteboard force rank, you end up walking out with very different outputs than when you start the meeting in sales 100% of the time.

(01:19:36):
On the product side, you need to do the converse. You just need to say, "We owe sales 10% of our points, so in our team meeting, we're going to put in 15 minutes of our team meeting and we're going to make sure we have the priorities right from the sales team. Let's go over what I got from Linda. This is what she says. Is she wrong? Should we do something? How can we help the sales team be even more successful? And what inputs is the team hearing?" And they can raise their hand and say, "Look, I just had this all the way conversation with Bobby, but honestly, Lenny, I can build a HubSpot integration in a day." "What? I thought it was really hard." "No, I did it my last company. And listen, actually, we can actually outsource it to Bob and Linda at this agency I know for 20 grand. They'll build it next week." That's a magical moment. That's a magical moment. But you've got to each have these parallel meetings. The good thing, that tension can become debilitating. We've all seen those fights, those almost fights that break out, and they come from a place of passion, but you got to have structure.

Lenny (01:20:30):
Great advice. Another trend I've been noticing is that product teams are taking on P&L responsibilities and revenue goals. What's your sense of, is that good? Is that bad? How do you think about that for product teams?

Jason Lemkin (01:20:42):
You want everyone to be aligned on the big picture revenue goal for the end of the year. Is the question, you mean having financial bonuses and stuff tied to hitting the plan?

Lenny (01:20:51):
More that their KPIs and their OKRs are essentially this much revenue, you need to drive this much revenue from your experiments, from your product launches.

Jason Lemkin (01:21:00):
As you can see, I have a lot of opinions on things here that are data-driven and they're live experience. This one, I need another year in the oven, and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. What happened in the last 18 months is, in customer success, which is, in the old days, it was related to product. Now, it's less so, which I think is unfortunate. In customer success, in the last 18 months, this happened all across the industry. 24 months ago, customer success's goal was happy customers, measured in retention, sometimes NRR, net retention with upsells, sometimes with GRR, just logos, how many logos. That was your only job, happy customers. Happy customers.

(01:21:35):
Then, things got harder in many areas of B2B, and every customer success team last year, their goal was revenue. You need to bring in more revenue from existing base, and it destroyed customer relationships. There is a leading public company, I will not name them, I'm a positive guy. I will tell you, a company we all have used for years and loved, and they did this to their customer success team. And they came to us last year, we paid $299 a month for this product for our team. They asked us for $50,000 upfront or said they would turn it off that day. That week. Maybe it was that week. $50,000. That's what happens when you weaponize ...

(01:22:10):
So customer success, and I know this is going to trigger some people, but it is true, when I talk to leaders, customer success got weaponized and I don't like it, okay? I don't like it as a product. All founders are product people, I think. I don't like it as a product because I think it's bad for customers. That experience I got was horrific, wasn't it? That $50,000, being told. And it got walked back. And the fact that it got walked back is almost even worse because it wasn't true. It was a threat. So do I want to weaponize the product team? I want the product team aligned with revenue. These are the tough decisions for founders. But I think we're going to regret, to some extent, weaponizing teams that we don't need to weaponize.

(01:22:50):
Having said that, I will tell you, and again, no knock on Adobe, but when I was a VP at Adobe, and it was a long time ago, when product was in another building, in some cases, that was not great. And I love Scott and the whole team, it was a great experience, but I can just tell you, what I learned is, that did not work for me as an agile guy, having groups that would do this work in isolation.

(01:23:08):
And the problem was they would never talk to a customer. So I know I want product constantly talking to the customer. I know I want the VP of product with a lot of equity, wanting to hit the bookings number for the year. Do I want your average PM weaponized and forced to bring in revenue from an experimental feature when everyone agreed it's the test we're going to run? We only can run so many. You say, should they have revenue for new feature launches, for new product expansions, for new things? Yes, but everyone's got to make that decision. There aren't that many of us that have 1,000 extra engineers sitting around with nothing to do.

(01:23:44):
Even the smallest experiment, no matter what it says on the internet, again, that we release 100 a day, I would argue bringing any product extension to market's very expensive and risky because you're taking away from something else. These are expensive decisions, and if you punish people for the mistakes in product, this is something that big companies are actually better at than startups, which is, they don't fire you if the new initiative fails. Because then, no one at a big company would ever join the new initiative. There are exceptions, but no one at Adobe or Google would work on the new product if you got fired if it didn't hit $100 million its first year.

(01:24:21):
One thing I saw that was very, and I don't know how to bring to startups in my big company experience, was it's liberating to some extent to let people fail, up to a point. It's liberating. Because the cost of failure in a startup is so high. It's just so high. I know that's not what the exact question, and ask me in a year, but my advice is, just be careful that you don't weaponize functions.

Lenny (01:24:44):
I probably should have clarified. I think this is mostly true in PLG companies where most of the growth is coming from product, but I imagine the advice is still the same, as be careful putting too much pressure on the product team to focus on revenue.

Jason Lemkin (01:24:55):
Well, that's how you get dark stuff. Back in the day, I remember my sister worked at Vistaprint for online business cards, and her entire job was to force people to buy upsell of additional products on the checkout page they didn't want to buy. That was her whole job. And she was paid a large variable comp to get people to buy third party products without realizing in their checkout, and it worked. That's all she did for three years was figure out dark stuff, I mean, darkish, grayish stuff so that when I bought my business card, I also bought GoDaddy and 11 other things that I didn't want. It works, but it doesn't create high NPS, does it?

Lenny (01:25:34):
Mm-hmm. No.

Jason Lemkin (01:25:34):
The thing is, here's the thing that you have to think about. What's crazy, Lenny, now, and I talk to a lot of these folks is, there's so many SaaS companies that are a billion or more in revenue. I just wrote up, there's just Pimcore, which is SaaS for [inaudible 01:25:49]. I just wrote up, it just crossed a billion in revenue. So many folks are at a billion. CloudFlare just crossed a billion. And the only way you can do that is if your revenue compounds.

(01:25:59):
And in fact, just myself, I just interviewed Matt Mullen from WordPress, 20 years he's been doing this, and he said the number one thing he didn't understand at WordPress, at Automatic, was the power of compounding. When you do these things that are customer hostile, and a lot of us were under stress this last 12 days, to hit the numbers, right? This is your job as founders, is you got to load balance the fact that the cash has to last and my investors are mad with me, but nothing matters in B2B that it compounds. And some of this dark stuff you're talking about on PLG, it anti-compounds, right?

(01:26:30):
And I would say, let me flip it around. The magical thing at the high level that it compounds, if you have a self-service model, a PLG model, I actually think the number one most important metric is churn. It's going to this churn, churn, churn, churn. And when I meet any startup for investing or anything, if the churn is not top decile for a low end product, I'm always out. It's almost unsolvable. It's almost unsolvable. This 3% to 4% a month churn rate that a lot of SMB stuff, it's almost unsolvable. I think that's where the energy should go, is relentlessly bringing down churn so that, 20 years from now, we all have billion dollar AR companies. That's what we want.

Lenny (01:27:11):
I have a rapid fire set of questions before, actually, the lightning round. We'll see if we have time for all these things. I just have a bunch of random questions that I'm going to fire at you and and see what comes up. Sounds good? Okay, cool. I got a thumbs up. Let's do it. Okay.

(01:27:23):
What is just one thing a founder or product leader can do to become better at sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:27:28):
The number one thing they can do, and this is very tactical, at the end of each meeting, because again, both of them are good middlers, the head of product and the founders are good demos, they're good at talking shop, they're good at talking in the industry, they're good at talking workflows. Learn. This is the only school you have to learn. Even if you're not comfortable asking for money, learn to ask for what's the next step, Lenny. This is what all great salespeople have learned to do. Actually, mediocre salespeople are terrible at this. The best salespeople never leave a meeting without a next step. The next step does not have to be a check. Don't break the relationship, but what's the next meeting? The next meeting might be, "Lenny, is there someone else at your company that I could do a demo for?" People are lazy, they don't want to do multiple demos.

(01:28:06):
But in 2024, we all have to demo multiple stakeholders. In 2021, it was one stakeholder. Now, it's a four-stakeholder sale. If you don't know what to ask at the end of the call, ask, "Who else? Lenny, is there someone else? I know you're excited to buy our product, but who else? Is there someone else in the organization? Can I help you? Can I just do a demo?" A demo is not threatening. Whatever the next step is, "What's the next step we can get on our books?" And listen. The best salespeople march deals step by step by step by step. And then, they put in the time. They've done the demos, they've done the pilot if they need to, they've helped them get going, they've helped them see the value. And then, if it takes six steps to say, "Okay, Lenny, now, we've got five folks at the organization using it. They've seen, here's the deal. They love it. What can we do, Lenny, to get going? Can we get a contract signed so we can get going on February 1st?" It's just very natural.

(01:28:56):
And founders just end the Zoom. They end the zoom, and they wait. They wait in their inbox for the next step to come, but it doesn't, it rarely comes on its own. That's the number one tip is, make sure yourself and you log it in your CRM that you always have a next step after. You don't have to be great at sales. As long as you're moving the ball down the field, then, get it into the red zone, and then, figure out how to ask for the money. But you don't have to ask for the money until it's in the red zone.

Lenny (01:29:21):
Amazing. While we're on this topic, is there a book or a course or anything that you'd just recommend folks go to get better at sales? Just, is there some tactical, "Go read this thing, it'll help you?" Or is it just, it's hard, you're not going to figure it out reading a book?

Jason Lemkin (01:29:35):
I am a voracious reader. If I only wanted to plug myself, and I usually wouldn't, two things that we have, we have something called SaaStr.University. SaaStr dot University. It's free. There's a pretty good course on learning about sales. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. It just organizes a lot of the stuff we're talking about and it's free. I think it's pretty helpful. We actually wrote a book called From Impossible To Inevitable that sold about 100,000 copies.

Lenny (01:29:59):
Oh, wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:29:59):
I did almost none of the work, although a lot of is my content. Aaron Ross did it. It's actually really good, and it interviews a lot of top sales leaders and goes through a lot of stuff we did. I don't usually hype it, but for 15 bucks, I think this ... And actually, I've never made one dollar. I've never even gotten a check for these 100,000 copies, but I do think it's actually ... The second edition's pretty good. I think, if you like what we're talking about, the SaaS University and the others. I just hyped my own course, which is free. I don't think I'm selling something if it's free. The book, I don't make a dollar on. I'd be very cautious, and this is tough, maybe this is something we can work on together. There's so many courses and so many people selling stuff the last two years. Just be cautious. Just be cautious.

(01:30:39):
The last thing I will say is, there is another community called Pavilion, and I do think it's great, Pavilion. It does have a lot of networking and stuff for sales and connecting sales with founders, and I am a super fan of what they're doing. That one's worth investing. But be careful about Bob and John's sales courses on the internet. There's too many.

Lenny (01:31:00):
Awesome. All right. We'll link to all those things in the show notes.

(01:31:03):
Next question, what is the ideal trial length for a free trial for sales team? Is it 14 days, a month, years? What do you recommend?

Jason Lemkin (01:31:11):
Tomas Tsangaris did a whole SaaStr presentation just on free trials and free trial legs. It was really good, but the one thing you didn't know, which I know just being an old timer is, one of the reasons we have 14-day trials on the internet is, in the old days, the Salesforce sales team, when they were SMB focused, wanted to close deals that month, so they forced Salesforce to move from 30 to 14 days. There was no evidence it was better for the customer. There was no evidence that it got usage going or people ... They just wanted to close deals the same month.

(01:31:41):
That's something to be cautious about, these metrics. And be cautious, since we're talking to product folks, be cautious that they're customer centric. Salesforce is very enterprise now, but in the old days, it pushed it to 14 days so the sales reps could close deals faster. What we learned from Slack and Zoom until recently was infinite trials work pretty good. So does Canva. Slack and Canva, and until recently, Zoom, were okay waiting four years to convert. And those are epic companies. Those are epic companies.

(01:32:12):
And these are one of the things that only founders can make these decisions. I wrote this post years ago saying, "Who's your VP of Free?" Because who's got a VP of Free? Do you know anybody that has a VP of Free? I got a VP of Growth, I got a VP of Product, but if you have this massive free base, who's your VP of Free? I know almost no one that has a VP of Free. And usually, it's some kind of collaboration between product and the CEO. They're the VP of Free, but even then, you need a VP of Free, and we don't have one. There's no perfect answers, but in a world where we're tightening nooses everywhere on trials, we're tightening nooses everywhere, be careful the advice you get, be careful the short-term advice.

(01:32:49):
For example, another related terrible piece of advice VCs give you is switch to annual contracts. This is terrible advice. Terrible advice, Lenny. Terrible advice from people who've never built products and aren't in the field. Going to annual contracts, on a spreadsheet, looks great. On a spreadsheet-

Jason Lemkin (01:33:00):
Going to annual contracts on a spreadsheet looks great. On a spreadsheet, it looks great. You know what's better? Letting customers pay what they want to pay. If it's you or me buying for ourselves, Lenny, we're still going to put it on a credit card, aren't we? If it's our own personal... And we want to pay monthly, usually, we don't know. We usually want to just try it monthly. Big companies want to pay annually because they have procurement departments. Why force people to go the way they don't want to go? So, just start, this is a product audience. Product needs to be the voice of the customer. It's not so much customer success as it used to be. It's not so much sales. You've got to be the voice of the customer together with the founders and push these things.

(01:33:39):
Think about, I would do the longest possible trial that is still customer-centric and understand there's tension. Understand there's tension, right? I say anytime I'm in a board meeting where some VC says, "Let's do annual for an SMB." I mean, I'm like, "No. Show me the money. Show me the evidence that this is better for the customer." Right? How many times have you gone to buy something for yourself and it's 19 bucks a month? And that's annoying because it's an [inaudible 01:34:05] credit card charge. But do you want to pay 240 up front? I mean, maybe you do it for a Riverside or something you use all the time, but some random product you just discovered, you're just going to bounce.

Lenny (01:34:14):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:34:14):
So, who's going to show the data in the bounce, right? A related point for like in sales. No one does enough. Everyone does these win-loss meetings, but no one talks enough about the deals they lost. Everyone talks about the deals they won. All the lore, the tribal lore in sales is how we won the deal. People should be spending more time talking about deals they lost than the deals they won, right? And same thing for this PLG motion. If you make your... Yes, I give everyone a pass for 2023, everyone whose growth plummeted and did things they shouldn't. Did price increases they didn't earn, cut the free trials, hid their free editions. I'm going to give you, look, you've got to give your team a little stress relief, right? So, I'm giving every person I work with, every portfolio, everyone a one-year pass, but the past is in the past. We got to get back to being customer-centric and building businesses that build to 1 billion ARR on their own because they're wonderful businesses that are product-centric, right? That recur. And every time you rip a customer off, you lose, the relationship's damaged, isn't it?

(01:35:21):
And a controversial thing I say to the product team, but I think this is the right thing if you're going long, is look, everyone raised prices last year, as you know, right? Everyone raised prices. The question I ask folks is, "Did you earn it?" What feature did you [inaudible 01:35:36]? If you raised prices 8% last year, did you add 30% more value to your product? In the old days pre these crazy years, the answer usually was yes. People would wait up, they would wait a couple years, right? And the whatever product from four years ago was so much better. It really was. Really had earned 1995 instead of... Last year, no one earned their price increases. No one came out with an amazing new edition, an amazing new functionality that earned it. They just sent you an email saying, "You're paying more." So we get one pass, but earn it. Earn your price increase.

(01:36:12):
Have the longest free trial possible. Own it. And this VP of free thing, it's got to be founders working with product because no one else cares about the free. You can't expect the sales team to care about free, can you? You can't expect the marketing team to care about free. Unless they can immediately monetize them, right? Unless they can ram them into conversion. People abuse their long tail in the last 18 months, but your long tail is... These are your... Even if they don't convert that much, they're your advocates. I mean, how many people read your newsletter? 500,000 people, right?

Lenny (01:36:42):
Almost 600,000.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:42):
Okay. 600,000. Now, not all of them convert, do they?

Lenny (01:36:46):
No, no. That's exactly how I look at it. It's kind of this Brian Belfort is this... Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:49):
What about the 590,000 of them that love Lenny that don't convert, right?

Lenny (01:36:49):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:53):
If you over monetize them, then Lenny's community doesn't exist if you over monetize them. But when you bring in a VP of sales for Lenny and a VP of growth and... You can't expect them to care as much about that long tail as you, right?

Lenny (01:37:10):
I love your passion around this. So, what I'm hearing partly is you're a big fan of freemium, essentially, right? And the benefits of product-led growth where there's something you could just use indefinitely, or do you still think that's a trial where it needs to end at some point? Or is it just like, "No, freemium is great in a lot of cases."

Jason Lemkin (01:37:26):
Listen, I'm a big fan of long tails when they work. They don't always work for enterprise products. I'm a big fan of delivering more value than you take out for your customers. And I am a big fan overall of free, because, and I know you'll agree with me this, every founder figures this out at some point, free products are better software. Products that cannot offer a free edition cut corners because they don't have to be good at onboarding. The products that do not have a free edition have human beings that bridge the gap between buying and deployment. And that's okay at ServiceNow, and that's okay in certain products, but the best products invest the engineering cycles to have a free edition. Whether that's truly free, whether it's an extended free trial, whether it's a long tail or a medium tail, the amount of... All of your product is better if people can actually, if you have a free edition, all your customers benefit, even your enterprise customers benefit, they all benefit.

Lenny (01:38:28):
This idea of VP of free, I think technically it's probably the head of growth for a PLG company or the person leading the self-serve part of the business.

Jason Lemkin (01:38:36):
But even in the organizations I work with that have those structures, that person is focused on monetizing that tail. Who stands up for the 590,000 other readers of Lenny? Who's their champion?

Lenny (01:38:50):
Yeah, and you're 100% right. That's exactly how I think about the newsletter. There's this free audience and ideas over time, they get convinced, "This is worth my money and let's give it a shot."

Jason Lemkin (01:38:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:38:59):
So, yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:39:00):
And your growth person, let's say 1% converts. I'm just making that up. Going from 1 to 1.1 actually is a big deal at that scale or 1.2, right? That's okay. But you've got to nurture the 490,000, not spend all the calories just ramming the paid edition through, right? But only it's a fun thing, because once you hit a little bit of scale, this is part of your job as founders and product leaders is who's going to be this VP of free? It's not growth. I don't think it's the growth team or something. They got to hit their goal when their goal is to get another half million out of the newsletter this year. And that's their bonuses side to it. You think they're going to work on the free ones? No chance.

Lenny (01:39:43):
Makes sense. Oh man, there's so many things I can go into and want to go into. I also want to let you go. So with that, is there anything else, Jason, that you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Anything you want to leave listeners with?

Jason Lemkin (01:39:59):
I think just make this the year of the customer guys. And I really think that sales has been under so much pressure the last 18 months. Customer success has changed. Product teams have to step up. This is your time to do great things this year as product people. Be the voice of the customer. Be the VP of free, be the whatever. Be the champion. Stick your neck out. Work harder, folks. Work harder. The funnest part of anything in startups is working hard, but in product it's extra fun. By working harder, you have the more fun conversations. Find the delight in... The delight in product is making customers happy. It's not worth it otherwise. Otherwise, it's drudgery and it's endless PRDs and Gantt charts and mindless discussions. Make your customers happier this year, you will be happy. This is the year of product and we all get a pass for whatever bad deeds we did or mediocre deeds we did in 2023, get back and be the vanguard in your companies.

(01:40:53):
Startups need, and bigger companies, they need someone to inject energy again, in many cases. Energy has been lost. And it would be great if product can do it and say, "Listen, let's do something, even if we're not exactly sure how to get more leads, okay? Even if we're not exactly sure what to do, there's one thing under our control is the code we write and the product we ship. Let's do three great things this year. Let's just do them not good, great. Let's do three great." And what you'll find is the whole company will respond, including sales, including marketing, including... If we start shipping great thing. Few things inspire teams more than when you're shipping great products. So, be... If you weren't the leaders the last two years, if you were being forced to weaponize your customer base somehow ship three great things this year. That's my challenge. Ship three great things.

Lenny (01:41:39):
I love this. This is the year of product, that might be the title of this podcast.

Jason Lemkin (01:41:42):
Yes.

Lenny (01:41:44):
Jason, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jason Lemkin (01:41:50):
Okay. I'm worried about the first one, but go for it.

Lenny (01:41:52):
They're very non-surprising, because they're always the same. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:00):
That's the one I just want to take a pass on. I know they're the same. I read more than anybody else in the planet, but I wish I had those two great, great books that have changed my mind in the last 12 months, but hopefully I've added some value. But this one, I think I got to take a mulligan on it [inaudible 01:42:14] perfect answer.

Lenny (01:42:15):
Acceptable answer. Is there a favorite movie or TV show that you really enjoy?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:20):
Oh, the Terminal List.

Lenny (01:42:22):
The Terminal List?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:24):
The Terminal List, yeah. I'm not into the Chris Pratt. I'm not into that goofy superhero movies he does, and I know people like it, but The Terminal List, it's pretty, it's I got it, it's written by this ex Navy SEAL that I think tech people don't read the... Everyone, but outside of tech reads this author, but Amazon did this thing with The Terminal List and I think the reason it gripped me, it's like this post, it's like a lot of tech is right now is we're trying to do the right things, but are we doing the right things? It's just confusing. So this one, I couldn't put down, The Terminal List. That was my favorite show. The other one, the one I liked that I couldn't believe. You want the second one? Even though as product people, Maverick, and I'll tell you why. This movie Maverick, okay, you wouldn't think I'd be a Maverick guy, but the quality of this product, it was so high.

(01:43:18):
And what's interesting, you remember Maverick was supposed to come out before COVID, right? And Tom Cruise said no. He's like, "This is such a good product, we're going to wait years for this thing to come out." I'm like, " I'm not going to like this. I mean, cocktail was pretty good, but I'm not going to..." But as a product, when... I've watched this movie three times from a product perspective and just like software, when something is done that well, no wasted calories, no... You see everything tied together. That's the kind of software we love, right? It just delights us when it works better than we expected. So, those are my two.

Lenny (01:43:53):
You also did all his own stunts, which I think is a good metaphor for the VP of product, maybe being involved in sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:43:57):
Actually do the work.

Lenny (01:43:59):
Yeah, exactly. Oh man, I'm stretching it. Okay, next question. You answered a few of these already, but do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing salespeople, especially?

Jason Lemkin (01:44:09):
I answered it, but I'll bring it up again in case you do it again, is, "What do you want to do your first 14 days to head of product or head of sales? What do you want to do your first 14 days?" It's not a technical 30-day plan, you don't have to do 28 slides. It's what I call a Colombo question. Not that I really watch Colombo, but Colombo is this old detective on TV who, I don't know if you ever, he would ask these dumb questions, right? And then the murderer would thought Colombo was so dumb, but by the end of the episode he'd always incriminate himself because the question. So, when I interview, I always do Colombo questions. They're never tough ones, right? They're always nice. I don't know if I'm nice, I'm honest, but the interview [inaudible 01:44:42]. But Lenny, what would you do your first 14 days as VP of product here? And they don't want to visit customers. Don't hire them for either all sales or product. Just don't hire them.

Lenny (01:44:51):
I've got the answer now. That's exactly what I was going to say. Next question, what is a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?

Jason Lemkin (01:45:00):
My two aren't really amazing, but I'll answer them. I love this Opus Clip app for making clips from video. I know you have a whole team, so you probably don't need it, but I produce a lot. I mean, a lot of us do content marketing, right? Whoever does it. I produce a lot of content. I don't have enough time to do this. So, the only AI tool that I've found helpful so far is Opus Clip, which takes all of the incredible amount of YouTube content we have, force ranks it and turns it into 59 second clips. And I'm a case study on the website, I tried the earlier products. They were almost there, right? But it's not, is it as good as a clip team? Right? Is it? No.

(01:45:41):
But literally in 60 seconds, what's interesting is it can do something, I don't have time to, I could never make YouTube clips. I could never make Instagram shorts. I could never make... It just would never happen, right? It would never happen. And the fact that one product enables you to do something at a minimum viable quality you couldn't do before, I'm a super fan. It's pretty interesting. So, that's my favorite. And my other one is this one. This is the folding phone that's finally as good as a normal phone. See, there's The Terminal List that I've got folded up and it just works.

Lenny (01:46:11):
That's wild. [inaudible 01:46:12].

Jason Lemkin (01:46:12):
Weighs the same as an iPhone.

Lenny (01:46:13):
Wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:13):
And so the reason it's cool is this has changed the way I do productivity. One Plus, it's the One Plus. One Plus, yeah, it's the first one that's the same form factor, same weight, same... So there's really no, there's no loss, right? And I can use my normal phone here like I'm using, it's a little funky, but it's the same... And then to be able to do content, to be able to check, to be able to do full email, full account, full everything like an iPad.

Lenny (01:46:39):
We see your Tesla where it's going, that gets parked. That's very cool. So, it's basically like an iPad plus a phone in one.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:47):
Yeah, I probably use this 50% of the time of the iPad.

Lenny (01:46:50):
Wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:50):
So, that's it. That is it. The other ones that-

Lenny (01:46:52):
And that's an Android?

Jason Lemkin (01:46:53):
... Make sense to me. Yeah, it's a Android, yeah.

Lenny (01:46:55):
Amazing. I had not seen that. That is extremely cool.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:55):
Very cool.

Lenny (01:46:58):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?

Jason Lemkin (01:47:07):
It's, "Be kind." When I reflect on my career, right? Mistakes, I don't think I'm mean. I actually think I care more than most people on the planet. I like to think I've helped a lot of people, but it's not taking the time to be kind at times and not taking time to be kind when things don't work out. Not taking time to be kind when you leave a situation. Not taking time to be kind when maybe someone's done the wrong thing, right? Not taking time to be kind to a customer that leaves, right? I remember in the early days of Adobe Sign of EchoSign, we had a top tech customer, and I killed myself to close this customer, right? Famous, huge, huge tech company today. And then our champion changed, right? Champion changed is the big issue in software and product and came in and brought in DocuSign instead of us.

(01:47:56):
And man, I was just so mad. I just tore into this guy. This guy had actually had dinner at my house, right? And he actually never, he just did it because it was good for his own career, right? And I was so mad, but I broke the relationship forever, right? That's just one random example. And I just think there's so much advice to fire fast and to be relentless and do all these things, right? But you've interviewed so many people, Lenny, right? I mean so many great leaders. I haven't done what you've done, but I've talked to almost all the top CEOs in SaaS, okay? And they're kind. It doesn't mean that they're soft, they're not soft, okay? They make tough decisions every day, but they're kind. And so in this world where everyone feels like they're getting ripped off or they're not paid enough, or I want founder pay for founder work, this motto, really it's troubling.

(01:48:51):
Everyone is founder pay for founder... "You want me to work more than 30 hours, Lenny? I need 30% of the company. I need founder pay for founder work." It's like, I hear you. But you'll find that by being totally committed, going to 110% and also finding a way to be kind, that will endure across your whole career. So, I know it's... Because I think I'm good, but not always kind. It's how I challenge myself all the time. Be kinder in that conversation. And the big epiphany, we already talked about it, it shouldn't have taken me this long to realize that anytime an employee fails, it's your fault, be kind. You hired them. They never knew what they were getting themselves into. If the job's too hard, if they lack the skills, if there's not enough budget, if there's not enough people, if it requires too many hours to work, you should have known that. Not them. Be kind. Be kind to every single person on your team that doesn't work out. That's not just putting together an email spreadsheet and sending it out. Try, try harder. Be there for them. Be kind.

Lenny (01:49:44):
Be kind. I love this. I know that you actually, your username on Twitter includes, "Be kind." In your actual-

Jason Lemkin (01:49:51):
It's a reminder.

Lenny (01:49:52):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:49:52):
It's a reminder.

Lenny (01:49:52):
So, you really back this up. Amazing. Okay, final question. You're on a giant conference, SaaStr.

Jason Lemkin (01:49:58):
Yes.

Lenny (01:49:59):
First of all, just talk about what it is so people know and explore it and check it out. But the actual question is what would surprise people most about running a conference like this? Things that they know, think about it goes into running a conference like this.

Jason Lemkin (01:50:13):
Any business, no matter how weird it is, that's at scale, the best one in it, it's always interesting, I think for case studies, right? The best, pick anything, the best cup maker, whoever it is, whoever makes the best... This is not an interesting business, the Starbucks cup on its own, but the best person, I pretty much guarantee you there's a good story there, right? SaaStr is a community as well like you have. We started this really early in 2011, 2012 for B2B founders back when that seemed like a weird thing to do. Now it doesn't seem so weird. So, we built a lot of content and we started doing events and meetups. I never did a meetup. You do a lot of meetups, but when I did meetups, I'd never actually even been to one. So, I did meetups in 2012 and 2013, but 1,000 people came to the meetups.

(01:50:56):
That will make sense to you today, but a decade ago for B2B, it was pretty, people were like, "Why are all these people here? We thought there was six of us that cared about B2B." So, then we did a big event. We did a one-day SaaStr annual in 2015, and 3000 people came including the evening. And so we just kept going. So, we get about 10 to 12,000 people together a year. What that means is change. It's no longer novel. I'm not the only person producing B2B content anymore. I'm not the only founder that sold their company like in the old days. There's plenty much more successful founders and better, I certainly, I don't do very many podcasts, because I'm not a hundredth as good as you. I do one a quarter, for example.

(01:51:34):
But the events have become this meeting place for founders that have hit scale, that are somewhere between 1 million and 20 million. And especially folks that aren't in Silicon Valley, especially folks that aren't sitting in Hayes Valley or wherever, that don't have a community. And that surprised me in the beginning how many international folks would fly all the way to the Bay Area. I remember this founder came from Perth, Australia for the first afternoon. I'm like, "Thanks for coming, but this is a lot of work." He is like, "I didn't come for you. I came because there's no one like me in Perth." So, it's taken on a life of its own. There's a lot of learnings. I think, I didn't intend to do mass scale events. I intended to just do meetups, because I had a community like you do meetups. So, it was absolutely an accident. The learnings are, it's extremely expensive and it has this weird curve. Okay, that's this weird curve where, and this is more because I think actually all founders, all startups should be doing events for their own customers, at least steak dinners I've written about. You should get your customers, if you get your customers and prospects together, you sell more. Get your customers and... It does not need to be a million dollar or 10 million event. It can be Roots Chrises, it can be whatever. It does not even need to be fancy. Just get them together.

Lenny (01:52:39):
It has to be steak though.

Jason Lemkin (01:52:41):
Yeah, well, no, but steak does work. I mean, I'm not a big steak guy. It could be any, just something nice where they want to go. It, just where they want to go. Your customers will sell your prospects for you. Your customers will do the selling for you [inaudible 01:52:53] bring them together.

(01:52:55):
When you do it really small, it's cheap, because how much does that back room cost at the steakhouse, right? It's worth it if you get one big deal out of it, right? And then you graduate and then you'll do a meetup and you'll do it at someone's office. Some tech company, they'll give it to you for free, they have an extra office. That costs nothing, right? And then you're like, "Well, that went well. We got 100, 200 people came to Lenny's thing at Digital Ocean." And then you say, "I'm gonna do an event." And then you rent a theater, a disuse. And these theaters are actually kind of cheap because they're dark during the day. There's not a lot going on and a lot of... Not movie theaters but music. So, those are cheap. But then you're like, "Well, there's only one stage and it smells like beer."

(01:53:34):
So, then the next year you do a hotel and a hotel's pretty expensive. It's like half a million, 800,000 and I hated hotels. But you know what I learned from the business model? It's turnkey landing. So, your marketing manager can call up the Hilton in any city and in two weeks spool up some mediocre AV, some mediocre chicken wings and drinks, okay? And you and I don't like to go to the Hilton that much. The ballroom C, we don't like to go to events [inaudible 01:54:00], but it turns out your customers don't care. They want to be together and talk about your app, right? And then if you do community like you do, you could probably charge a couple $100 for tickets and get some sponsors and bring in some revenue, right? But then after Hilton Ballroom B, it costs $2 million to turn the lights on.

(01:54:16):
And SaaStr annual... So, our Europa event in London's in early June, June fourth to fifth, please come if you want. That costs $2 million to turn the lights on in London. To turn the lights on in the Bay Area for 12,000 people in September in the Bay Area, which is the most expensive place, right? It's $10 million to turn the lights on.

Lenny (01:54:32):
Holy shit.

Jason Lemkin (01:54:34):
It's $10 million to turn the lights on. Now, I'm being a little expansive in what I mean by turn the lights on, but this is what it's going to cost you. It's going to cost you about $1000 per attendee in the Bay Area or Las Vegas to have a mass scale event. Not smaller, not one day in Grand Ballroom B, but a multi-day event, right? The AV is 1.5 million. The food and beverage is 1.5 million. The tenting is $800,000. I can keep going. So, once you get to 20, 30, 40 million in revenue, quietly, there's public companies out there.

(01:55:04):
They have software like Margins at that scale, but before that, it's brutal, right? And when I started doing these events, I interviewed the head of it back before March 2020 when tech companies did their own events, they've pretty much given up, which is an interesting side topic. Big ones like big, not small ones, but big ones. Biden View, the head of events at everyone, right? At Twilio and Marketo and dah, dah. They all be like, "Well, how'd the event go?" It'd all be the same. Well, we brought in about 1.5 million revenue. " Oh, okay." "And we lost 2 million." Everyone lost 2 million. Every single one lost 2 million. And you could see in the financial state, even Zoom at that scale just announced how much money they lose at Zoomtopia. So, it's a terrible business. What I like to say is it has diseconomies of scale. The Lenny's little free meetup costs zero, right? And then the one at Cloudflare's office costs zero.

(01:55:50):
And the one at Hilton B maybe costs $200, but then it costs $1000 per person at scale, right? Even more like Moscone like in San Francisco is probably the most expensive. You're approaching $2,000 per person, because you have to buy about 15 to 20 million of hotel nights to do an event in Moscone, right? So I don't know if that's... We could, I mean it's a side topic, Lenny's side podcast for people that care. But this diseconomies of scale. But there are a handful of public companies that do Lions, Money 2020, Shoptalk, a few others that are at SaaStr scale. And they cobbled together these very profitable public companies. But they all got to do at least 20 to 30 million, because you've got to get over a 10. And it's intimidating to get over a $10 million net, right?

(01:56:33):
And so what it means is we have to spend 14 to 16 months each year planning for SaaStr annual because it's not that fun if you fall six or $8 million behind. That's what happened in March 2020. We were the first major event to be canceled by COVID in March 2020. The first one, RSA happened for security the week before then we got canceled. So, we lost $10 million in one day and it took a long time to dig out of that hole, Lenny, especially since we monetize nothing, it took a long time, but they're worth it.

(01:57:04):
I know you don't do traditional events, but you do do meetups in your community, and I know they're worth it. I know they're worth it. Bringing your customers together, bringing your community together, and we talked about this offline before we started. Second tier, third tier events I do not think are worth it because they do not attract the best people. It's just a fact. Most people, it turns out from our founders are our core ICP. They go to two events a year on average, two events a year, okay? And they'll do other steak dinners. So, if you go to one of the two that they're at, you just might bump into Jeff Lawson or Eric Juan or whoever the next one. They might be there. That might be one of their two, but they don't go to number three through 10. They don't go to these. So, my role in general is people wonder, should I go to events? Is it worth my time? It's a waste of time.

(01:57:49):
And I know you've thought about it. And the irony is, even though we produce events, I used to think that. I didn't want to do events, I just wanted to do meetups, right? I was shy, I just wanted to do meetups. But then I learned over time that the best events bring the best vendors, the best executives, the best everything together. So, pick the one or two best events in your industry. And even if you're antisocial, try to go to one or two a year, go along. It pays off. It pays off, but maybe don't bother with the rest, even if they're ski slopes or they're fun that the subscale, subscale just doesn't work for meeting and marketing to people. It just doesn't work.

Lenny (01:58:25):
I said at the top of this podcast that there's a billion things that we could talk about, and I think that's exactly what happened. We can go in so many directions. And that alone was extremely interesting, because people want me to run a conference and I really don't. And I really enjoy the meetups that we have now. And we actually do have sponsors that cover drinks and food and things like that, and they're very chill, and I really love what happens at those things. But yes, this is really good information. Jason, I have two more questions for you that I ask everyone. I think we went through a couple of these things, but just real quick, where can folks find you if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on some of the stuff you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jason Lemkin (01:59:03):
In general just go to this kooky, URL, SaaStr, saastr.com. That's a way to access a lot of what we're talking about. If they want to reach me to be transparent, I get a lot of impound, like I'm sure you do, to be honest, guys, it is hard to process the amount of inbound that folks get, right? But I'll give you an insider tip. I do see almost all of it. So, if you want to reach me, if you just want an hour of my time randomly, I'm sorry, honestly, I'm sorry, I don't have that hour of time, okay? But if you want to interact lightly, I mean, I'm on Twitter all most days @Jasonlk. I'm on LinkedIn a lot, just search for me, Jason Lemkin. LinkedIn's pretty cool. I have 260,000 followers. We have really good conversations. And I will tell you, if you have a question like you really need some help in your business or you want to do a pitch, if you send me the world's best email pitch, I will read a 100% of them.

(02:00:00):
Track it, put it in Mixmax, put it in HubSpot, put it... You'll see I'll open that email if the title's good. It doesn't mean I can respond. I'm sorry, no, Lenny can't respond, but realize it is going to be read. If you need a favor, like a help, if you ask the question super discreetly like, "Jason, here's the LinkedIn, I'm Lenny. I'm trying to hire this person. I'm at four millionaire doubling. Should I hire her?" There's a chance I'll look at that LinkedIn, I can tell you, or if it's one question, but if it's an hour or coffee, it isn't going to work, but it is going to get read. So, do that by email. Do it even by LinkedIn. I didn't used to read those LinkedIn emails, but if it's really good, I will read it and I probably respond to five or six of them a day.

(02:00:35):
I give to the extent that it's helpful, free answers, free advice. Not that I charge for anything, but make it good. Don't ask for coffee. So, many folks have written this, the most important people in the world read email. It's an open medium, right? And a subset of those folks actually read their social media. Even Elon Musk reads his, before he bought Twitter, he read it. You can access almost anyone in this industry. Just be super strategic about how you do it. Again, put yourself in your shoes. Would you answer this? Would you do this? But I would say half the stuff gets open to read. So, I know that's a rambly answer, but first, we talked about sales. You can reach anybody in the world via email. It's magical.

Lenny (02:01:11):
I'm sorry for the many emails you might get from this podcast. That is actually really good advice. Resonates deeply with me as well. Jason, thank you so much for being here.

Jason Lemkin (02:01:21):
Thank you for all the time, Lenny. I'm a super fan. It's great to be here and let me know anything I can do to support you or your community going forward.

Lenny (02:01:28):

## Transcript

Jason Shah (00:00:00):
Pushback is, I couldn't imagine a word more viscerally that makes you feel like you're sort of physically going against what somebody else wants, and it gears people into a mindset of then, well, how should I push back. It starts from a place of I need to disagree, I need to say no. It's a very negative mindset, purely based on the word that has come to label a behavior that alternatively could be about how do I shift the direction on something, or how do I help the business actually succeed when I disagree with somebody about something, and that's a very different mindset. And so, the two things that I've seen be most successful would be, I think number one is actually understanding what a goal is or what somebody's kind of issue is with something, and then actually aligning those things in some way.

Lenny (00:00:53):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Jason Shah. I was lucky to work with Jason while I was at Airbnb, and when I started working on this podcast, I knew that I wanted to have Jason on. He was actually my very first guest on this podcast when I was pre-recording some episodes, but as you'll hear in our chat, we decided to take another crack at it for reasons you'll soon understand.

Lenny (00:01:28):
In this episode, we cover what it's like to be a PM in Web3 and how that's changed as crypto winter has returned, how to lead a team through ups and downs, which leaders in Web3 know all too well, including how to keep morale up and people focused when so much is changing around you. We also get into a ton of killer advice on leadership, hiring, pushing back on your CEO, working backwards, career advancement, and a lot more juicy stuff. Jason is a gem and I am really excited to share this episode with you. With that, I bring you Jason Shah.

Lenny (00:02:05):

I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor, Amplitude. Hey, John.

John Cutler (00:03:36):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:37):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (00:03:49):
Well, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So, the big aha was seeing how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (00:04:09):
And supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (00:04:14):
Yeah. So, Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.

Lenny (00:04:22):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started. Jason, welcome to the podcast.

Jason Shah (00:04:34):
Thanks so much, Lenny. Really excited to chat with you today.

Lenny (00:04:36):
Something listeners don't know that we know is that we actually recorded an episode between you and I back in April. It was actually my very first episode that I ever did for this podcast, and it was before I launched. It was kind of like a pre-launch launch episode, and interestingly enough, by the time the podcast launched and it was going to go out, well, let me also add that we chatted mostly about Web3, forgot that detail. So, most of our chat was about Web3 in the state of Web3 and PMing in Web3, and by the time the podcast's supposed to come out, Web3, things have changed in the world of Web3, and so, it kind of felt a little stale and out of touch, and so, we decided let's do it again. And so, how do you feel about that?

Jason Shah (00:05:15):
I appreciate that, Lenny. I'm honored that you would have me back. I'm going to count it as the personal record of two times on Lenny's Podcast, even if the world only knows it as one.

Lenny (00:05:26):
Wow. Good one. Okay, first ever guest and first two-time return guest. Amazing. Okay. To set a little context for folks on your background, your career, could you just give us a 60-second overview of your background and your career and how you got to what you're doing today?

Jason Shah (00:05:45):
Yeah, for sure. Thanks again for having me, Lenny. So, my career has all been about solving important problems in a unique way. I think the latter part is the youngest child in me who has to be special and do things different than other people, and the former is about making sure that my time is spent well since we're all limited there. So, I actually got started in a sense in tech when I was 15. I started my first company, much like a lot of teenagers, it was around test prep and getting people ready for college, and it was my first exposure to using technology at scale to help people, and I just found it addictive ever since.

Jason Shah (00:06:20):
And so, I ran that company for seven years through school, was lucky to do a small acquisition to a partner of ours that we had worked with throughout, and then I would just hooked, and I moved to San Francisco without a job. I was really arrogant. I said, "I'll never work for anybody else," and then lo and behold, Yammer comes along, I'm super excited about it, I had been working on a product actually in the same space. And so, that was actually my first formal product management role, and I stayed at Yammer, I stayed through the Microsoft acquisition back in 2012. Low and behold, I was at the world's largest productivity company at Microsoft, and most people there in my opinion were wildly unproductive and I wasn't shipping a lot. I got the itch again, so started another company called do.com and ran that for about four years, and then eventually, we found a better fit with Amazon. They were growing their AWS offering, SAS products. So, we partnered with them to kind of do a small acqui-hire and help build the team out and the product there for a little over a year.

Jason Shah (00:07:18):
And then again, to be honest, I got bored and excited about what Airbnb was doing and the mission around belonging. That's why I was lucky to meet you and so many other really wonderful product leaders and just human beings in general at their core, and then to keep things brief for now, I got to work on a lot of really exciting products and businesses there, but eventually got the itch for Web3 after being a kind of observer from afar, investor, and I wanted to be a builder in Web3 specifically, and to me, it's a new vision of a better version of the internet. I'm really excited about that. So, I've been with Alchemy which is a blockchain infrastructure company for the last year, and really excited about all the opportunities. I've gotten to work on products that have been part of most people's everyday lives, and I'm hopeful that we'll get to do that with Web3 and Alchemy as well.

Lenny (00:08:05):
Amazing. I just realized as you're chatting there, do.com, I'm pretty sure I used that back in the day. I think I just realized that.

Jason Shah (00:08:12):
I hope so. That would be a new, I'll add that to my second podcast achievement is if I got Lenny to use a product that I worked on, especially a startup.

Lenny (00:08:20):
Wow. Cool. Okay, so we're going to go a little bit backwards through your career and start with Web3. We're not going to spend most of the time on Web3, but just thought it'd be good to chat about some of these things, partly because you guest authored the sixth most popular post, online newsletter of all time, currently at number six, and it was about how to be a PM in Web3. Basically it's called The Product Manager's Guide to Web3. And so, a few questions there I wanted to touch on. One is just like, how would you describe the current state of Web3? We're recording this at the end of July, and so, we'll see when this comes out. But I'm just curious from someone working within it, kind of going through the boom and the busts, not the bust, the winter that we're kind of in a little bit right now. Yeah, how do you feel about it right now?

Jason Shah (00:09:01):
Yeah, for sure. So, as much as I'm a techno optimist, I'm also realist, and with that being said, I genuinely believe Web3 is in the strongest position that it's ever been in. I think it's important to remember that the term Web3 has barely existed in kind of popular lexicon for barely a year. We've definitely had crypto for more than a decade now as technology, arguably as a financial instrument of some sort, but specifically the number of companies that I'm seeing be formed, the number of products that are starting to actually achieve some form of early product market fit, some products that are starting to scale. There's definitely been obviously a huge drop in price. There's definitely been some huge scandals in terms of financial mismanagement and the contagion from that.

Jason Shah (00:09:46):
But I think it's been my experience that a lot of new technologies don't move up in a straight line, and Web3 is especially challenging here because so many things have been financialized from the outset, whereas generally speaking, you'll see startups or new technologies mature over many years, whether it's the internet itself, artificial intelligence, QR codes, all sorts of things that kind of have gone through different periods of adoption, and so, I think we're seeing things kind of record Ethereum transactions happening, new Layer 2 technologies launching all the time that are going to help scale Layer 1 Blockchains, Solana has announced its phone that's going to be the first sort of Web3 native phone out there. So, there's so many new exciting product developments and users entering the space that as much as prices have come down, I'm really optimistic about the state of Web3.

Lenny (00:10:32):
I think about a little bit is going through this shift in excitement about Web3 as a PM within a company working in this space, I imagine it tests some of the core skills of a PM, like keeping people focused, prioritizing effectively, keeping morale up. If people are getting like, "Oh man, all my cryptos going down," I'm curious how you've been able to leverage those skills and what you've learned going through this experience, keeping people focused, morale up, prioritizing effectively, those sorts of things.

Jason Shah (00:11:00):
Yeah, it's a great question. It's really important, right, because we've seen in this space that there are these cycles, and I think that morale and ability to keep building are the determinants of long-term success, and if everybody kind of takes the ball and goes home, that uncertain future won't necessarily materialize. So, in my opinion, I think that the only way to maintain moral is to make progress. I think that no speech, no sort of extrinsic motivators like we're going to give everybody some free crypto to keep motivated about it or something like that really works. I think people get really excited when they see progress.

Jason Shah (00:11:37):
So, for example, at Alchemy, we see more developers than we've ever had on the platform today, and then we're shipping, we just launched Solana support and people are like, "This is real." We're actually doing things, building things. We just had our team out at EthCC which is a big conference in Paris for the Ethereum community, and it was wild the number of people that were there, products being built. Pretty much every crypto conference has a hackathon, and so, it keeps the spirit of building so alive.

Jason Shah (00:12:03):
And so, I think it at Alchemy and just in other situations that I've been in as a leader over time, I think it's all about a focus on progress and moving forward. We saw this at Airbnb when the business had a draw down in revenue, and I know you'd covered this with Sanchan recently, right? It was 85, 90% revenue and you didn't know when it was going to turn around, right? It's not just like, "Oh yeah, this will come back in six months and we can just keep plowing forward." But I think what worked was making progress and actually focusing on product and your customers, and ultimately if you hire the right people who are motivated for the right reasons, I think that recipe keeps people highly motivated and highly effective at building for when things do eventually turn around.

Lenny (00:12:44):
One of the most interesting and maybe surprising points you made in the post that you wrote about being a PM in Web3 is that there's much less need for a PM, especially early stage Web3, and it feels like, the stuff you're talking about feels like a PM's really helpful along these lines. So, I'm curious, are things changing at all there? Have you changed your perspective on PMs and Web3, and then I don't know, where do you see the evolution of product management and Web3?

Jason Shah (00:13:09):
I actually am seeing things change a lot, and one thing in Web3, if one learns nothing is the ability to admit when they're wrong or when things change. And so, I think that that's exactly what I'm seeing. So, basically, I'm specifically noticing a lot of teams hiring product leaders, more product managers. Those product managers are actually now working kind of increasingly in sort of more traditional product management fashion, in addition to some of the differences that we discussed in the post around the community management and role in marketing and things like this, but specifically, Uniswap just made a big hire out of Meta. I saw that Gemini also did the same. We're seeing OpenSea hire a lot of talent along these lines too, even through the ups and downs that their business has seen, and at all levels. Whether it's kind of product manager, senior product manager, director, VP or CPO, you're seeing it across the board.

Jason Shah (00:14:03):
And so, I think that's partially happening because you're seeing a maturation of products, right, and so, maybe you can start early with a few engineers, a community manager, get the ball rolling, but eventually the product is more mature, the complexity has grown, the role of the product manager is far more useful than they can differentiate. I also think the market is getting increasingly competitive. So, there's many NFT marketplaces. There's many Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains. As a result, I think product is always a competitive advantage, right? If it's working, it improves strategy, it improves execution, and improves team collaboration. And so, maybe that was less of a difference maker before where these teams didn't need that competitive advantage as much because maybe they launched a token and the token was mooning, and so a bunch of people were adopting the product, but that only lasts so long, and first principles still come come in to focus, whether it's one day or one month from now.

Jason Shah (00:15:00):
So, I'm definitely seeing it shift. It's definitely making a huge, positive difference in the cases that I've observed, and my hunch is we're only going to continue to observe this because with more user adoption comes new challenges, and for all these players that are growing and getting some form of adoption, the product complexity is only going to grow, and having somebody to help lead teams, help prioritize between all the different products that they could build or strategies they could pursue is going to only increase in importance.

Lenny (00:15:27):
I know we're like we're PM people talking about the value of PM, but something I find is that people that are kind of anti having a PM or don't see why they need a PM in my experience just haven't worked with a great product manager because my experience, you find a great PM, they just make everything better, and so, it's not surprising to hear what you're sharing which is people are kind of discovering that value of bringing on a product manager, even if it's mostly engineering work. And so, that's promising, and I wonder if that's just a natural evolution of a new space where people are like, "Eh, I don't need PMs in this one," and then like, "Oh, okay, well, I see. All these things aren't happening. We need someone to help. Who can do that for us? Maybe it's a PM."

Jason Shah (00:16:06):
Yeah, that's a great observation. I think that combination of having a direct need for something that emerges as well as if somebody's had either a bad experience or not even had any experience with somebody who can play this role which is quite common in Web3, especially because a lot of folks are relatively early in their career, given the kind of accessibility of the space, and I think frankly the more adept understanding of the space naturally that a lot of people have when they're early in their career and less set in their ways. And so, that's a great point, and as a result, the better PMs we see in Web3, hopefully the value will prove itself out over time.

Lenny (00:16:41):
And hopefully they do well so people don't keep getting burned out by bad PMs.

Jason Shah (00:16:45):
We're rooting for all PMs, but definitely Web3 PMs too.

Lenny (00:16:49):
Yeah. What's surprised you most about working in Web3 as a PM?

Jason Shah (00:16:53):
I mean, I think that the biggest surprise to me, despite what we were just talking about, was how big some products have gotten without kind of the traditional either product manager role or without the playbooks that we're so used to from the last 20 years of the internet. And so, for example, Uniswap has done more daily volume on certain days than Coinbase, and Uniswap is about a hundred people versus 5,000-plus at Coinbase, right? So, that's astounding to me.

Jason Shah (00:17:21):
I think a lot of these NFT collections and communities that have grown. I met with a lot of these at NFT.NYC recently, and a lot of them, aside from the price speculation and things like this, have actually built, the Bored Ape Yacht Club is actually building a metaverse project that does look better than some of the digital games that I've used in the past of Second Life and things like this. Obviously, a lot of time has passed and so there's a greater foundation of technology to build off of and they're working with a partner on that product as well, but there's a ton of progress being made without some of the traditional product structure or individuals. And so, again, I think PMs play a really strong role, but it's been incredibly surprising to see how far products can get without the product playbooks and resources that somebody who's worked in the internet space from the last 10 or 20 years is so used to.

Lenny (00:18:11):
Awesome. Okay. We're going to move on from Web3 and chat a bit about some of your other career accomplishments and companies you've worked at. So, you worked at, you mentioned Yammer, Microsoft, Amazon, Airbnb. I'm curious which of those companies has most informed the way you approach product and build product and run teams because they're all so different in how they operate, and I'm always curious what company is the formative experience for you that's like, "Here's how I like to build product most." I know it's always a combination, but how do you think about that?

Jason Shah (00:18:39):
Yeah, it's definitely a combination, but I would say if I had to pick, Amazon, even though I was only there for about a year after the acquisition. I say that because of this blend between product and business thinking that is especially present there. And so, people say Google is an engineering culture. People said Facebook is a product culture, Airbnb or Pinterest, sometimes a design culture or things like this, and I think that Amazon was a place where you couldn't divorce business and product. You couldn't be a product manager without thinking about revenue growth, without thinking about go to market, and I really like that because as a startup founder doing product in a bigger company, it gave me the chance to exercise a lot of those skills.

Jason Shah (00:19:24):
It's very similar actually to how I feel at Alchemy now where I remember my first month there I was like, people ask me how's it going, I'm like, "I feel like an athlete. I feel alive again." I can do M&A one day, I can be doing product another minute. I could be figuring out, oh, we need to hire our first lawyer to write onboarding plans for employees the next minute, and it wasn't as siloed as sometimes a product role can be. So, I think Amazon, I went there to learn and understand. That was my biggest goal was this is an incredible company that's gone into... The Whole Foods acquisition happened when I was there, and I was wondering how does the same company kind of within retail win with the AWS, go create studios, and I think the Amazon culture ultimately more than anything else around ownership, being vocally self-critical is right a lot as one of the leadership principles. All these things combined I think created a really unique culture.

Jason Shah (00:20:12):
So, I would say Amazon's had the biggest impact on me, and there have been certain lessons that I've taken from, like you said, all these places, but Amazon was by far the place that I think left the biggest mark on my view on product and leadership.

Lenny (00:20:26):
That's quite amazing that you were there for a year and that's the one that's most informed and impacted you. Do you feel like people should try to go work at Amazon as a training ground as a PM? Is that something you encourage PM to try to do?

Jason Shah (00:20:37):
In general, I certainly had a positive experience, but I think that as you know and as I'm sure you've advised countless people, it's so context dependent. Are you learning the zero to one? Are you learning the one to scale? What's your aspiration? Is somebody trying to start a company eventually, or are they trying to work the ranks of the product leadership trajectory? And so, I definitely enjoyed it a lot, and I think to your point, there's often a non-linear sort of correlation between factors that we traditionally think are linked, right? So, my time there was one of the shortest, but my learnings were some of the greatest because I was really intentional and maybe because of the sort of moment in time and what I wanted to get out of it.

Jason Shah (00:21:17):
The same way for what it's worth, while we're talking about this disconnect, when I went to Yammer, I also interviewed with kind of... This was the era of TaskRabbit. I talked to Square and I remember people always say, "Well, what stage do you want to join seed, Series A, Series B?" And the crazy thing is that Yammer was, it was already passed a hundred people, it grew to 500 by the time of the acquisition, and it felt almost like the culture was so tightknit, it felt like a seed stage company at some points, even though eventually it kind of felt like... Well, once it was acquired from Microsoft, we'll just say it didn't feel like a seed stage company anymore, but it felt smaller than a lot of the actual smaller companies than I was at. So, I think that's something I've noticed a lot is that a lot of the proxies don't necessarily match the internal realities in certain cases.

Lenny (00:22:01):
You mentioned you picked up a bunch of tactics and kind of lessons from some of these companies. What's one concrete process or tactic that you took it away from either Amazon or one of these other companies that stuck with you that you like to kind of share with folks?

Jason Shah (00:22:14):
Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think one that Amazon is well-known for is the working backwards process, and for those that don't know, the idea is try to define effectively an ideal end state which funnily enough is very similar to some of what we both experienced at Airbnb and took away, and usually the mechanism for doing this is what's called a PRFAQ, and that's a press release and frequently asked questions, and it forces a certain degree of clarity to have to actually write a press release about the product that you're going to eventually launch.

Jason Shah (00:22:44):
Every employee goes through actually like a business writing class after they start at Amazon. They give you a little card with five tips that you're supposed to keep on your desk about concision and specificity in the words you use. For example, you should never write the word great in an Amazon press release. You should write user friendly in X, Y, Z way and will save customers time 20 minutes each day through this. It's intended to be very concrete in a way that avoids some of the fluffiness that frankly... It's funny, when people try to move from slides to docs, they really just import the same mindsets that they use in slides, but just with more words now.

Jason Shah (00:23:22):
And so, I think the working backwards process of establishing the long-term goal using a mechanism like a press release and the FAQs where every word matters, and even the FAQs, for what it's worth, there's a section for external FAQs that you would include for example as an appendix, but also internal FAQs that are meant to de-risk launch or raise the elephant in the room or dogs not barking as Amazon likes to call it often. So, that was a really helpful process that felt very true to me as a way I like to live my life as well, and then also very applicable.

Lenny (00:23:55):
The tidbit about not using the word great is so interesting. Is there anything else there that you could share about just basically just like how to write effectively and communicate and launch. Is there any other tidbits along those lines?

Jason Shah (00:24:07):
Yeah, that's a good question. In addition to not using the word great and words like it that are either subjective in what they mean or unclear in what they actually mean, definitely using numbers more than adjectives. Strict concision, I would go over these documents countless times, and there's a phrase, I can't remember, it's either Mark Twain or another famous writer who said kill your darlings, right? Cut, cut, cut, and just remove. And so, I think I found that really useful in emails I write or documents I write to this day is just going over, not because you're saving ink by cutting words, but because it forces clarity of thought. Fewer words means every word is 10 pounds in weight instead of one, and that means that the decisions you're making, the trade offs are far more intentional, and in the case of great, if you say something is great because we're going to deliver something in two hours versus Amazon's great because the selection is very wide, the implications on strategy are completely different. And so, that's one of the benefits of being very specific and very concrete in language.

Lenny (00:25:12):
I didn't intend to go too deep into this topic, but no one's ever covered this working backwards process on this podcast, so it's kind of interesting to talk about it a little bit more maybe. How does that actually work? So, you sit there and you actually write out a press release that would go out when you launch this thing. Is there like a template used? Is there anything you could share for folks that want to try this out and/or point them to a resource that will help them down this road?

Jason Shah (00:25:36):
Yeah, definitely. That's a great question. So, there definitely is a template, and so, it's a combination of an internal training where you have to write one of these documents. You review kind of good, bad, medium versions of this. It's generally used if there's let's say a proposal for a new product or even a proposal to buy a company. This helps really simulate what it's going to be like.

Jason Shah (00:25:56):
With respect to a template, what I recall is it was often sort of an introduction where you get kind of right to the point. You say what you're announcing. Then usually you would describe the problem in one paragraph and in very clear language. Again, all of the writing is this way. Then the solution, you briefly describe the product. After that, there's always a customer quote, and this is an example of this customer obsession that Amazon is so famous for that many companies like to say or emulate, but I think it really kind of may not be true if you evaluate the mechanisms that they use, for example, product specs that either don't have customer data or don't have quotes from customers, things like this. And so, there's a customer quote, and you have to literally put yourself into the shoes of... Let's say you were launching Prime. Put yourself in the shoes of Lenny from San Francisco. What exactly is he going to say when he has access to this, and how's it different than his life today, and what are the words that he's going to use?

Lenny (00:26:52):
You can't use great.

Jason Shah (00:26:53):
I mean, if great is one of your favorite words, maybe you could stretch it, but I think if you were in a room with your peers at Amazon, they might put some red pen through any greats that are used there. So, I found that really helpful, and it also helps force out of this box that product managers, product leaders tend to get into of thinking that they are always the customer and being a little sort of intellectually lazy, where I'm like, "Yeah, I would like Prime, so let me write the quote for what I would like," but maybe I'm only a small segment within our total customer addressable market.

Jason Shah (00:27:26):
So, anyhow, there's a customer quote, then there's one leadership quote similarly that this achieves a complimentary goal, like how does this fit into our strategy in a way that you would express to the public but is still true to what the internal sensitivities and mechanisms would be. And then a call to action towards the end, and not just download here, but this will be available to customers next month. They can go access these portals within these Whole Food stores at this state. It again forces clarity of thought with respect to not only the rollout plan, but taking a step back. When you read it, do you feel like you would actually want this product? Would you use it? So, I found that really helpful as a structure.

Lenny (00:28:05):
Can you just summarize those again real quick?

Jason Shah (00:28:07):
For sure. So the structure of the PRFAQ docs was generally an introduction where you're announced the product, problem, solution, customer quote, leadership quote, and a call to action.

Lenny (00:28:17):
So, interesting how similar that is to a one pager potentially. The other thought I had while you're chatting, so the Airbnb approach is work back from the ideal, Brian talks about it, the 11-star experience versus the Amazon approach which it doesn't need to be the ideal, it just needs to be an awesome launch. So, that's an interesting difference, both effective in different ways.

Jason Shah (00:28:37):
I think people tend to, when they see that both companies have some sort of working backwards process of thought, I would say working backwards on one hand and then 11-star experience on the other. Listening to how you describe it, I want to almost frame it as working backwards from sort of a moment in time or a launch like you said with Amazon versus working backwards from a quality standard in some sense of an 11-star experience.

Lenny (00:28:59):
Going in a slightly different direction, one of the things I wanted to chat about is you worked at all these different companies and they have different types of leadership and different approaches to leadership. And so, I'm curious, what have you learned about effective leadership watching all these awesome operators work, and what kind of separates them in your experience from folks that maybe aren't as effective?

Jason Shah (00:29:18):
Yeah, it's a great question, and to briefly recap, right, I've gotten to see somebody like David Sachs who've been the CEO of PayPal and then the founder of Yammer and gone to do many more things since then. I've gotten to see sort of Jeff Bezos at a distance. I was never that close to him obviously and never got to work with him, but got to observe his impact on the organization. Obviously, I've gotten to witness Brian Chesky and his leadership in sort of the pre-IPO days as well as through the ups and downs of COVID, and then also now at Alchemy, our co-founders, Joe and Nikil are leaders that have really had an impact on me as well, and I would count myself, but I've also see myself as a bad leader in the start of [inaudible 00:29:56] and learn from that.

Jason Shah (00:29:57):
I think it's a really important thing to reflect on, and I think for me there are three things that have stood out the most. I think number one, nothing is above them. I've seen whether it's Brian caring about the full bleed image on the homepage, whether it's Jeff Bezos who famously would receive customer emails, read many of them, forward them, and he's famous for question mark emails where for his time's sake he would just forward an email to a leader with a question mark and you would just have to figure it out and then report back in 24 hours with the resolution thereof. But nothing's above them, and a lot of founders or a lot of CEOs or even CPOs and leaders think you get to a certain point and then I'm above a product spec, I'm above looking at the data running a sequel query, and I think that that is a mistake in a lot of ways, especially from a standpoint of who people come to respect as well as efficacy at one's job.

Jason Shah (00:30:51):
And then the other two things would be, I think they're in the details. So, it's less about being above something, but this is kind of Amazon's famous for auditing the details for example, and leaders are... For example, when we were going to launch Prime, order a bunch of Prime things and see what happens and really test things out, and write up a long feedback email on Saturday or something like that, and make sure that things are moving forward.

Jason Shah (00:31:12):
So, I think in my opinion, some of the best leaders, David Sachs would do this too. He actually ran the product reviews. It was the CEO of the company doing product reviews, not some kind of middle tier of a director of product who was just running them. They were force involved and there were things to delegate and activate around, but Sachs was in all of those details and ran those product reviews himself and would talk to the product managers directly, and I think that was really impactful, and it also, I think from an accountability and culture perspective, when you're PM and you talk to the CEO and you feel like you're presenting something at product review, it's totally different, and it creates a certain amount of responsibility and quality, frankly, that I think is really important, and it's a way to coach obviously as well for those leaders to really make a mark on the organization.

Jason Shah (00:31:59):
And then lastly, I think they adapt, right? I think that are a lot of leaders who are like, "I've worked 20 years to become a leader in this way and I have a playbook," either based on past experience or based on some sort of philosophy that they've developed over time that they feel committed to in some way, and I think coming back to some of these examples of watching Brian lead through COVID or watching Joe and Nikil now through this particular crypto winter shift gears and figure out exactly like we're still building the core business, but how else can we lean into this and adapt to the unique opportunities that are in front of us. I think that's really powerful. So, what I've seen is nothing is above them, they're in the details, and they adapt to new information and new situations. That's what I've seen the most that I've appreciated in the best leaders that I've gotten to either observe or work closely with.

Lenny (00:32:46):
Awesome. That's super interesting. The first two are kind of connected which is really interesting, and it just reminds me of Brian and how detail-oriented he was about everything. He used to review every product launch and every screen of every new product. We had to show him here's what we're launching this week, and he just kind of went through and either blew it up or let it pass. And then I just remember the founders, when they were designing the office space, just looking at pictures of listings they wanted to... Because Airbnb, the office conference rooms were modeled after Airbnb listings, and Jim just looking through hundreds of listings that the team brought him and he'd just picked the ones that he wanted to turn into conference rooms. Also, obviously Steve Jobs. This is a really interesting through line of great leaders is just this huge attention to detail, and there's probably something about once they let go that thing start to kind of diminish. Is that what you find?

Jason Shah (00:33:39):
Yeah, that's such a great point. You mentioned the Jobs example and there's a great book that you've probably read or in your community seen, I believe it's called Creative Selection by Ken Kocienda about the early days of the iPhone, and I think it was Project Purple or something like that, and you're absolutely right. There wasn't no slides, none of this. They brought in the prototypes for each of those reviews and things like how to do typing on a tiny screen and those early keyboards and how to do auto complete, and Jobs was totally in those details from Ken's telling in this book.

Jason Shah (00:34:10):
So, I couldn't agree with you more, and it's something that people miss because most of their exposure to leaders is on a YouTube video or at all hands, and so, they don't really get to see that side of leaders I think, and it's also not what I think from an ego perspective is kind of what people want it to be about. They want to be about making big decisions or commanding a large group of people, and I think it's hard to do that without these pieces.

Jason Shah (00:34:34):
One other thing I just wanted to briefly touch on to your point on how they're connected, it's a really good point, and at the surface it almost seems like they could potentially be the same thing. One thing worth calling out though I think is the idea of something not being above somebody or a person not being above things. I think the biggest thing I take away from that is humility is that nothing is not my job, right? Anything, could be picking up paper off the floor and putting it in the trash, or it could be reviewing a product spec, whatever it is, and then begin the details in my opinion is about craft, right, and really understanding things at a low level such that you're able to reason about it and make good decisions, like Brian with the homepage or Bezos in some cases with customer processes that he got in the weeds on. I think the two together, humility and being excellent at craft, I think is a very potent combination, especially when you throw in the last thing of being able to adapt to any situation.

Lenny (00:35:29):
That's really interesting. What it also makes me think about is the reason things are less good often if there isn't a person at the top that's being very detail-oriented, and I find this with the newsletter and this podcast and other stuff is no one's going to care as much about it. No one's going to be like, "Oh my god, I really need to get this right so much because I'm just like, I'm personally feeling responsible for the quality of this stuff and it's like it's on my shoulders to make this awesome." And so, I think that's probably why a lot of the best stuff is led by a singular leader or singular opinion or singular person. A lot of the best startups are just someone's vision is like, "Here, this is what we're going to do," and then the more it becomes a community-driven thing, the less often it ends up being successful.

Lenny (00:36:16):
This episode is brought to you by Maven. I've been an investor, an advisor, and a customer of Maven from day one. I even taught my product management course through Maven. Maven is a cohort-based learning platform where you learn alongside peers with a direct connection to your instructor. Maven's got a ton of courses for product managers, founders, and executives to help them level up in all kinds of ways. Over 10,000 people from Airbnb to Coinbase to Google to Tesla have taken courses from real experts and operators that have spent decades honing their craft. As part of their fall season which Maven just launched, there are over 100 new courses starting in the next few weeks. Many of the people I've had on this podcast are teaching courses like Jackie Bavaro on product strategy, Arielle Jackson on startup branding, Emily Kramer on B2B marketing, plus Annie Duke on decision-making, Nir Eyal on behavioral design and how to break into product management with Marily Nika. Check out all of my favorite courses and learn more at maven.com/lenny.

Jason Shah (00:37:19):
I feel like you're totally right, especially, I mean this is the natural progression, but it doesn't have to be that way right? And I think to your point, I think a lot of leaders focus on accountability in an organization once they get large, and so, you see things like performance reviews and things like this. It's a very top-down approach to trying to drive results, but is opposed to a sense of accountability if you drove a sense of responsibility. If people felt like this is my company too, this is my product, this is my office floor. I don't want trash on the floor. I'm going to pick it up and throw it there. Even if we have somebody whose job it supposedly is to clean that up, it's like I take pride of ownership in this and I'm connected to it, and I think that makes all the difference in terms of... At Airbnb, I think people who felt that way were willing to push back on certain things, or they're willing to propose new ideas because they felt invested in the company.

Jason Shah (00:38:12):
I see it at Alchemy all the time. I see an engineer hop in and fix something at 3:00 AM because they feel committed to the code base, and it's not a thousand-person engineering organization where my only job is to make the iOS app 2% more effective at engaging users.

Lenny (00:38:27):
So, you touched on the skill of pushing back on a founder or CEO, and I know that's something you're really good at. I've seen you do this. I'm curious what you've learned about how to effectively do that as a PM at a company pushing back on a CEO or founder when you disagree.

Jason Shah (00:38:40):
I mean, I think this is one of... I actually think it's one of the most misunderstood terms in a sense because I think language like we were talking about earlier is so important, and yet what you call something ends up defining I think 90% of what people understand about a concept, right? And so, pushback is, I couldn't imagine a word more viscerally that makes you feel like you're sort physically going against what somebody else wants, and it gears people into a mindset of then, well, how should I push back. It starts from a place of I need to disagree, I need to say no. It's a very negative mindset, purely based on the word that has come to label a behavior that alternatively could be about how do I shift the direction on something, or how do I help the business actually succeed when I disagree with somebody about something, and that's a very different mindset.

Jason Shah (00:39:34):
And so, the two things that I've seen be most successful would be, I think number one is actually understanding what a goal is or what somebody's kind of issue is with something, and then actually aligning those things in some way. So, in coming back to Airbnb, I remember Airbnb had bought a company, Luxury Retreats. There was a goal to integrate that business and that product into the full Airbnb suite, and there was a lot of potential with that, but I remember that there was part of the product experience that was oriented around chatting with somebody and the idea that the business had had a very large team of wonderful people who helped you as concierges basically for your trip, and so, this was a team that I was on that, to be honest, had fairly low morale. It's always difficult to integrate an acquisition with a company, especially when we were based in different places, et cetera.

Jason Shah (00:40:26):
I remember hearing from a leader who had been at Airbnb for a while who's very effective at persuading senior leadership, and they understood why this was a problem because this chat product was growing in complexity. You'd have to build all these features into it, and nobody could successfully shift the direction, and as a result, it was just this... It was a mess as a result, and there was very low morale because we were taking on too much scope, people weren't sure it was the right product, it was being built up as one giant launch as opposed to an iterative thing. And what was really interesting was that this leader was very effective at understanding that the goal wasn't about building a bunch of features. It was about, as often discussed at Airbnb, a magical experience.

Jason Shah (00:41:06):
And so, when we took a step back, it was reimagined as trip designers, not concierges, and their goal was to design your trip, and part of that meant a very elegant, simple chat experience so that you could have a efficient, fast, positive experience with that trip designer and move on. And it shifted the pushback of like, "We can't build this thing, it's too many features, we don't have enough time, we don't have enough resources" to, "Oh, we all want a really elegant, really smooth, slick experience for our customers. How do we do that? What's a trip design or a new concept that is actually going to elevate things? We're not telling you we want a payback scope. We're not saying we want to settle for less. We're actually just not only going to call it something different, but also envision a simpler experience which is more elegant. It's more on brand with luxury."

Jason Shah (00:41:51):
Boom, all of a sudden, everybody gets what they want. It's a better customer experience, less scope, and it wasn't about saying no. It was about understanding what we're all actually sharing as a goal which was a great simple customer experience and then actually building that. So, I saw that to be really effective and I think that that's something I try to bring into my career. I have a couple other examples if it's useful, but that was a big one that I learned from Airbnb.

Lenny (00:42:16):
Yeah, another example would be great. One thought there though is do you think it was mostly the name and the concept or was it that it was a bigger idea? What do you think it was about reframing it that way that got people, "Oh wow, okay, now I'm really excited about it again"?

Jason Shah (00:42:30):
That's a great point. I think it was a big idea, right, with a good reframing, and I think it's like many things where there's the substance of something and then there's the communication of it. And so, this is true often, for example, if a company is changing strategy. Oftentimes people might walk away feeling like, "Yeah, I guess I kind of agree with the strategy, but the way was communicated was really poor," or vice versa, like, "Yeah, they told us in advance and they sat us down all hands, but I really disagree with this strategy and I'm going to be dug into my heels and not disagree and commit now."

Jason Shah (00:42:58):
So, in this case, I think you're totally right. If it was just window dressing of... Founders are too smart, especially at all these companies we've talked about, to be fooled with a simple renaming of something. But I think the combination of a bigger idea, more exciting idea that was at the heart of what we were all going after together, combined with a simple way of communicating it because I've also seen big ideas that are poorly communicated fall flat on their face and not achieve the intended outcome. Those two together, I think were a really potent combination.

Lenny (00:43:28):
Awesome. I'd love to hear another example.

Jason Shah (00:43:30):
Yeah, for sure. So, a recent example at Alchemy actually, right? We're growing, we're hiring, but there are a lot of roles, especially being in Web3 that are not yet created. For example, there's traditionally growth, product growth marketing, we've created new area around growth operations which I'd be happy to talk about if we want to get into it. But it's a really interest interesting area, and we were going back and forth on should we hire for this role, it's not even a real thing. We've looked at some candidates, we're not so sure about them. And when I realize with our founders who are incredibly smart, very talented, have built the company over so many years now, they want to win. That's what they care about at the end of the day. They are so driven to win at the end of the day.

Jason Shah (00:44:10):
And so, ultimately, it wasn't like, "Let me make some rational argument about the role of growth operations or let me defend some issues with this person's resume that maybe you're spotting when we make this hiring decision," but, "Oh, you want to win? Oh, we want to grow faster? Awesome. This is the way to do it, and that's how we're going to actually become the generational company we want to be." Again, a reframing in this case around, yeah, we might disagree or squabble about certain things at a detail level, but I understand what we all came here to do and let's focus on that and how this is a part of that versus just focusing on maybe the means to an end versus the end itself, and the end always brings a lot of clarity in my experience.

Lenny (00:44:49):
What's cool about both these examples, and another guest touched on this, when you're trying to influence the CEO or the founder, coming back to your working backwards concept, you almost want to work backwards from what are they excited about, how do they see the world, what's important to them, and then pitch it that way. So, in the first example, I imagine they were pitching to Brian and he's like, "Yeah, drip design, that sounds like something Brian would love." Then in the second example, "Yeah, we're going to win. Here's how we win." So, that's a really interesting takeaway there.

Jason Shah (00:45:15):
I mean, I think we all forget that we're all just humans, and at the end of the day, we all are busy, et cetera. It reminds me of a lot of sales, right? I was very unsuccessful when I was trying to do outbound sales in the early days of my last startup do.com because I didn't understand this. I'm a product person. I'm not a sales person. I didn't listen to what people cared about. I didn't kind of work backwards from what a CRO or head of people that we might have been selling to cared about. I was just about features and here's what we can do for you and this and that. But all they cared about were one or two things, right? Maybe the CRO's growing revenue. Maybe the head of peoples worried about culture or scaling their talent organization, and we were nowhere near that list.

Jason Shah (00:45:56):
And so, I think it's similar for CEOs, and there's a huge disconnect when say a PM walks into a meeting with the CEO and they're talking about something that CEO is 10 miles away from thinking about, and certainly even the mindset that they're bringing to the conversation is totally different. I think Casey made a lot of great points about this in the recent podcast as well.

Lenny (00:46:16):
Sweet. Casey Winters, podcast plug. Okay, so something else that you're really good at is you don't kind of focus career-wise on working your way up the ladder and being like the top PM, and you seem to be really good at kind of following with what's interesting to you and your interest and your curiosity. Is there something that you've learned there, something you could share for folks that are just like, "Oh my gosh, should I just keep in with this job and work my way up? Should I try something new?" What have you learned about that sort of thinking?

Jason Shah (00:46:46):
There's the framework I like is ladder versus map, and I think that you can be either person that any point in your life. Sometimes there's a bit of a set mindset that somebody might have one way or another, but I like ladder versus map. Ladder is about moving up. It's more influence, more power, a higher title, things like this, whereas map is I just want to go wherever's interesting, right? I literally think of it, I think of my career very similar to travel. I want to go to Greece. I want to be hungry, walking around in India, sweating in a hundred degree weather. I want to go to Australia and kind of get locked out of my hotel and see what that's like.

Jason Shah (00:47:23):
I'm okay with discomfort because it's interesting. Sometimes, for better or worse, maybe this is a privilege, it's certainly a privileged thing to say, but I care more about living a really interesting life than let's say a good or comfortable life. I think that's where the growth comes from. That's where the stories come from. That's to me the things that I'll remember the most.

Jason Shah (00:47:42):
And so, when I think about product and I'm on my deathbed, I'm going to care about the products I built and how they affected people. Nobody's really going to be looking at my LinkedIn, hopefully for their sake and mine, at my funeral. Sorry, it's a very morbid analogy, but I think thinking of the future provides a lot of clarity about what am I going to care about a long time from now, and I think that applies to all facets of life. That's how I thought about my life partner. That's how I think about my career. That's how I think about where I want to live, San Francisco. San Francisco, a lot of people like to talk negatively about it, but I believe in the community. I believe in the place I'm interested in the long term, even if you know the short term it has some challenges to it.

Jason Shah (00:48:21):
So, I personally believe really strongly in this kind of ladder versus map distinction, and I think a lot of people are very intentional in the micro. They think about their next job, their next title, how much salary and equity there is. In good ways too, they think about the team that they're going to work on next with, but they're very unintentional about the macro. What's the big picture? What do I care about as an individual? There's not a lot of classes for that. There's not a lot of blog posts in the product management field about the touchy-feely side of this, and who are you as a person, where do you get energy from. So, for me, I found that really clarifying and it makes career decisions that have seemed risky to other people seem inevitable to me.

Lenny (00:49:03):
Is there a story of or example of how you use this approach to make a decision at where you end up going, and/or or is there something that you maybe regret or are really happy with in terms of the kind of the fork in the road, looking back, using this way of thinking?

Jason Shah (00:49:18):
A few concrete examples, actually. I'll keep them brief though. One is when I first moved to San Francisco, and I had mentioned I did a small sale of that education company, and I could have done a lot of more productive things with my career in the short term. I had all my peers from college who had gone off to their great jobs at Google or whatever. I said, "I'm looking to move to San Francisco and work at my dining table, and I have a little bit of savings from this, so why not? Let's see. It's going to be super interesting." I mean, it was also very boring at times, and so, I didn't want a lot on the sort of micro level, but I built five or six products. I became much better at programming as a result.

Jason Shah (00:49:56):
I remember one time, it's kind of a goofy story, but I was working at my dining table, and I saw Ron Conway on the street. I was disheveled because I was just working from my apartment and I wanted to go pitch Ron Conway on this terrible idea for a startup, and so went out there, and maybe it was fortunate to not shove me to the side, and he listened to me for a minute and then I emailed him after. These are random things that happen that over time I think make us who we are. Are you the sort of person who's going to hustle and do that? When I was building that education company, I went and put flyers in people's cars in various high schools, and I was trying to get things started, and coming back to leadership, that would be below most people. It's like, "Wait, you own a company and you're sticking flyers in people's windshields?" It was like, "What's wrong with you?"

Jason Shah (00:50:40):
So, anyway, I think that was an example of time where it was like, "Okay, if I'm on the ladder," I'm like, "I got to get the best entry-level job or whatever." Even if I had been an entrepreneur before that, I would've thought about my structure in my career, and I was more like, "This is going to be interesting. I'll figure it out. I believe in myself enough that I'll figure it out." So, I did that. Yammer and leaving Yammer was similar where I could have stayed. My equity was finally worth something. I could have learned a lot even I'm sure from the Microsoft structure, but I was bored and I had been talking to a couple angel investors who were willing to put money into whatever the thing was going to be, and I felt like raising money's actually going to be really hard for me. This is going to make my life a lot easier and I can focus on product and so on and so forth.

Jason Shah (00:51:25):
That was a really hard four years. Things like an M&A offer falling through the day before your wedding, or chewing glass and submitting to the Apple iStore and being a featured app and then resubmitting because we wanted to fix a bug, and then actually now it crashes 90% of the time. It's Memorial Day weekend and you can't get in touch with the Apple business development manager who can help you out to reapprove something. It was a really stressful four years, but using the map analogy, that's like getting lost in Croatia and having to find your way out or getting lost to to your hotel in Australia or getting bitten by a dog in Thailand, which actually did happen to me. But these are interesting experiences that I think build characters.

Jason Shah (00:52:05):
So, I'll pause there, but I think there are a lot of career decisions I've made. Do I have regrets? At times, for sure because you see what would've happened if you had joined a different company at that time and it would've been like, "Oh, I would've met so many great people. I would've worked on these products. I mean, my equity would've been worth more," whatever. But I think you only lived once, and I think that these rare experiences have been very true to me and taught me things that I wouldn't learn otherwise.

Lenny (00:52:28):
What's really cool about that analogy, ladder versus map, is a lot of times you think you're climbing a ladder and you think it's innately going to be great, and sometimes that ladder falls over and the company doesn't go anywhere and/or the job sucks, your ladder's heading to some terrible place. And what I find in my experience is anytime I try something totally new and take a risk, especially following things that give me energy, and I'm just like, "Let's just take a leap on this thing," in my experience at least, it's always led to better opportunities and much more interesting work. And so, it's kind of this get off the ladder to get on a different ladder, and sometimes you think you're on a nice ladder and it's not going to get you anywhere anyway. So, explore other ladders. So, I'm kind of picturing a Chutes and Ladders.

Jason Shah (00:53:15):
Totally.

Lenny (00:53:15):
There's many ladders and you want to explore the different ladders across the map. How about that?

Jason Shah (00:53:20):
I mean, I think you're totally right, and the only brief thing I would add to the way that you put it which I think captures the essence here is I think we all have a lot of false precision about what we think a given career move is going to lead to or what it's going to be like, and we forget that a lot of career decisions are made out of maybe 10 hours cumulatively talking to a team and getting signals.

Jason Shah (00:53:44):
So, I think that that false precision sometimes gives us comfort in making certain decisions and folds us back from a bolder decision that might be better, but maybe the ladder is just hidden behind some fog if you really want that, and you can get both. Maybe you can go to the most interesting place in the world, and have the success in life and progress and so on and so forth. It's just that I think a lot of people think it's totally either/or. They think that they've already figured out the precise outcome that's going to happen, and to your point, the ladder often does fall over. If that's what all your hopes are pinned on, it's a very fragile career decision I think is really difficult to navigate.

Lenny (00:54:19):
The flip side, you also don't want to be bouncing around over and over and over. As much as I talked about how I shifted and tried new things, I'm a very serial monogamous in terms of work. My first job, I was there nine years, then a startup for a year and a half, and then Airbnb for seven years, and then what I'm doing now may be forever. And so, there's a lot of value to sticking around and kind of seeing things through. And so, I guess, I don't know if you'll have an answer to this, but do you have any wisdom on when to stick with it and keep exploring opportunities at a place you're at versus trying something new?

Jason Shah (00:54:54):
My hope is that there's a balance here in the sense that the map shouldn't give the impression of 180 countries, let's do 180 tech companies and shorten the tenure from two years down to a month, and we've just created a generation of job hoppers which is even easier because we're all on Zoom. It's a good point and I really respect people like you who have stuck it out through the ups and the downs and somebody sees seven years on paper, but I mean, seven years, I don't know. How many chapters of Airbnb, how many crises moments?

Lenny (00:55:26):
Felt like 300.

Jason Shah (00:55:27):
There you go. So, I think there's a balance, right? For example, I want to be in Web3 for more than a decade. I want to stay at Alchemy for a very long time and help build the company. So, I guess when I think of map, maybe an important way to think about it is maybe when somebody is 50 or 60 or 70 and they might choose to stop working, a lot of people when they start their career actually have 30 years to play with or 40 years or 50 if they're lucky. That's a lot of chips you can play. You could do five, 10 year rounds, right? And so, I think that in terms of sticking it out, maybe I'm biased, I think that some of the absolute sort gems, if you will, in Silicon Valley and tech are the teammates that are willing to stay around for 4, 5, 6, 7 years, and they have institutional knowledge that nobody has. They have a positive impact on the culture that is impossible if there's constant employee turnover.

Jason Shah (00:56:19):
So, to me, I think that you could simultaneously be somebody who's committed to companies, stays for a very meaningful amount of time, but zooms out and looks at their career. Actually, I think maybe this was even more, right? You're now a famous podcaster. You were a successful startup founder. You were a product leader. All these things form a map and I think a really interesting career and life, frankly, that's pretty full with a lot of really interesting milestones and learnings and networks and people that you get to interact with.

Lenny (00:56:47):
Yeah. To your point about how long a career is, when I thought about it recently, this is my fourth career. First it was an engineer, then it was a founder, then a product manager when I got to Airbnb, and now this weird thing that I do, and there's so much time to explore and try new things. I will say though, I feel like the early things you do seem really important. Airbnb for me was not early, so maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like you want to work at a company where people look at that on your resume and are like, "Oh, okay, this person's probably good." So, I feel like there's that piece you got to get right at some point.

Jason Shah (00:57:21):
Yeah, I totally agree with that. For example, I think for let's say a new grad who's thinking about a product career, and let's say on the spectrum there is maybe Goldman Sachs because that's what a lot of people are doing. They're like, "Yeah, I want to do product, but I also feel like I need this gold star or whatever." And then in between is you could join a hypergrowth company of some sort where they definitely have good product people you can learn from, but definitely still room for you to do more than what a very junior person would be assigned to be doing. And then on the other end of the spectrum is I'm going to have no job, I'm just going to completely bounce around from my own projects or just work with a new startup every two months.

Jason Shah (00:57:58):
Personally in that spectrum, I tend to be more towards the middle of that where build a track record, build a network. I mean, it's crazy. Even just this week, next week I'm seeing maybe five people that I know from my Yammer days, and to your point on formative nature, some of those people, that's how I learned how to do product. That's how I learned things like AB testing. It's how I had the first angel investors in my next company. That's how I hire. I still hire people, maybe much to their chagrin, they still get LinkedIn messages for me trying to push them for the next thing.

Jason Shah (00:58:27):
So, I totally agree that those early days are really formative, and there's maybe a balance between nobody wants to be a job hopper, but at the same time maybe there's ways to also not just be a career person who spends kind of 30 years working up the ladder or is fixated on I need to be CPO but is willing to give up a director title to go be a hustler at some startup because they really believe in it and they want to take a bet or risk in their career.

Lenny (00:58:50):
You touched on hiring, and that's something I wanted to ask you. So, you're in my Talent Collective. You're a company that's hiring, Alchemy, and I was looking at the stats recently, and you're one of the most successful companies at getting candidates to talk to you, and generally I think you're just really good at hiring. So, I'm curious what you can share with folks about hiring.

Jason Shah (00:59:10):
I appreciate that, and I get a lot of value out of meeting some really talented people from the Collective. I think hiring, it's funny, it reminds me of sort of push back in a sense of what you call it has such an impact on how people think about it. It's hiring, recruiting, but if people reframe it as the people you are going to work with every day or the people who make the company what it is, it shifts the mindset. It's like how is that not the most important thing to be thinking about as a leader or as a founder. A lot of people have benchmarks. I think maybe on the Google podcast I talk about 30%, 40% of a founder's time maybe spent on recruiting because I think deep down everybody understands that that's incredibly valuable.

Jason Shah (00:59:53):
I think that for me personally, I was reflecting ahead of the podcast on how I approach things now after different stages of hiring, and for context, for what it's worth, I've been at the zero person startup. It's just me and I'm trying to convince some Google engineer to come join us which is incredibly hard and has a low hit rate, to a place like Amazon or Airbnb where you have a large world-class recruiting organization that is effectively doing sourcing for you and setting up interviews and such things like this, and there's formal calibrations and interview panels, to a place like Alchemy where it's very sort of scrappy. We need to figure out who we even want to hire. The founders still meet with every candidate. It's a really different environment.

Jason Shah (01:00:34):
So, this is kind of the spectrum that I've seen, and I was reflecting what do I think works the best, and I like to think of it in very similar motions to a business where I think there is a marketing aspect to it, there was a sales aspect, and there is a product aspect to it. What I mean by that is that on a marketing level, I think what has a person heard about your company. Do they know anybody who works there? Do they read your LinkedIn post about things and already know that you're a known quantity before they even step in the door to interview? Are they even willing to interview based on what they know about the company? And so, I think that the marketing aspect in it, and I mean it's sort of lower case marketing in this sense of course because I think a hard sell of any sort or anything that's not authentic is probably going to fail ultimately, but it's about developing a really positive kind of brand and reputation for a company but also as an individual.

Jason Shah (01:01:26):
And then if you pass that threshold, I feel like there's a sort of a sales process, and we were talking about how bad of a salesperson I am, for example, because I didn't listen to people's pain points and understand the one or two things that were most important to them. I think similarly in this context, if they're an engineer, do they want to work in a world-class engineering organization? If they're a product person or they're just really excited about crypto and they want to find a way in, a place like Alchemy's the best place for them to learn that is how to think about it, and it's not about misdirecting on or matching whatever they say, but it's about really understanding who they are and what motivates them and what they're excited about because I'm as concerned about the kind of post-hiring step as I am the pre-hiring and want them to work out and be happy and be effective.

Jason Shah (01:02:12):
And then lastly, I think there's a product angle to it that not a lot of people think about or talk about a lot because I think the product, it's one of those rare cases where job descriptions are almost like product specs, right? They're here's what the responsibilities are, here's what we need you to do, here's the qualifications we're looking for. And what's really funny about that is that product is very iterative, but somehow we just write a job description, and then it's bait, it's done, it's posted, and nobody thinks about it again until the person's hired and then they take it down.

Jason Shah (01:02:41):
I think taking a product mindset where I meet people all the time now where I don't really know exactly what role they're necessarily going to fill, I'm not really sure about exactly their seniority, maybe they don't have a lot of experience, but maybe they would just totally be a rockstar on our product team. And looking at a product that we can mold flexibly and think of the same way if at Airbnb, if we were going to build Airbnb Plus, if we just kind of came back to the Amazon working backwards and just wrote a document and it was over, that's one thing, but we didn't do that, right? We went and actually built rooms and homes that were supposed to be Airbnb Plus, and then we iterate on it and we changed the pillows and we changed the entrance and we changed the scent that you feel when you walk in. We coach host and learned about that.

Jason Shah (01:03:21):
So, I think a product mindset on hiring and iterating on it based on the candidates you're meeting, the needs of the business. So this kind of marketing, sales, product combination has been what I've found to be really effective at getting people excited, understanding who they are and what they need, and then crafting a role that actually makes the person successful, rather than just checks a box in your recruiting software as some new headcount that was hired.

Lenny (01:03:45):
One last question before we get to our lightning round. For PMs that are listening to this maybe early in their career, what skill have you found to be most important in helping you and helping PMs in general advance in their career?

Jason Shah (01:03:59):
Yeah, this is a really important question, like the others, but I think that understanding and defining what problem matters is the most important skill that I think I've taken away, and it applies to so many things. It can apply to a specific product we're building. It can apply to what a company's mission is. I think I've found it really effective because it affects pretty much everything. It affects what we're going to build. It affects is the team motivated by what we're doing. So, specifically for example, at a place like Alchemy where, yeah, we're a developer platform, but should we build an SDK so there's abstraction that is easier for developers to use? Should we build an NFT API because we think that's a really important stack to move into and an important use case to support?

Jason Shah (01:04:45):
Well, the question is what problem are we solving? It's not this versus that just in a vacuum. It's is the problem developer experienced and we want to make things easier to develop. Is the problem that an NFT marketplace, a whole suite of them are trying to grow and need more support from us, and not understanding these problems clearly? And it goes back to my first company. It was an education company, and the problem was that low-income students didn't have access to the same resources to get into college as other students, and that guided everything. That guided the pricing model which was basically free for a long time, and then we monetize on sponsorships from colleges, right? The problem matter, whereas the problem solve was there's not a... A different problem was there's just no good college readiness program. Fine, then you focus manically on the pedagogy and the curriculum and so on and so forth, rather than say the business model and an initial product that you think can work.

Jason Shah (01:05:34):
So, that's what I've found to be the most useful, and I can give her other examples if it's helpful, but understanding what problem we're actually trying to solve and really getting crystal clear about it, I think has been incredibly useful to me and energizing as well.

Lenny (01:05:48):
It's such a good reminder, even though it's such a cliche of product managers being, "Well, what problem are we trying to solve here?" People hate that, but Michael Paul, and I mentioned this on a different podcast too, he makes this point that when you do drugs sometimes, you have these epiphanies that you come out and you're like, "Love is all you need, man." It's like, okay, yep. But it feels so right. You really feel it. The reason that it's such a cliche is because people have found it to be so true for so long that it's annoying now, but it also tells you how true it is. And so, I think it's a really good reminder of yes, it's annoying to ask that question, and people make fun of PMs for that, but that's because it's so damn important.

Jason Shah (01:06:28):
Just a brief kind of additional, what you share there, I mean, I completely agree. I think it's very true in life, right? It's like, well, what matters? And it's like, well, your health, your family, your sense of purpose. It's like nobody's unfamiliar with the answer, but like most things, it's about the application of it and about the nuance of it, and I think that's what product is ultimately sort of all about too.

Lenny (01:06:48):
Awesome. Are you ready for our lightning round where I'm just going to ask you five quick questions, tell me what comes to mind and we'll have some fun. Does that sound good?

Jason Shah (01:06:58):
That sounds great. Ready.

Lenny (01:06:59):
Okay, cool. I think I'm going to start adding music to these things. I got to figure that out. For now, no music. Okay. What book do you recommend most to other PMs?

Jason Shah (01:07:07):
The Hard Thing About Hard things.

Lenny (01:07:10):
Can you add why?

Jason Shah (01:07:11):
I think it teaches product managers to chew glass and care about outcomes the way that a CEO has to, and I think that's a really useful mindset to have.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Man, this chew glass metaphor, I don't like the sound of that.

Jason Shah (01:07:24):
I saw you cringe. I was a little worried about that.

Lenny (01:07:27):
Oh my god. What a great job we have here, chewing glass. Okay. Other than Alchemy, what's a company you recommend most to PMs to go look for new gigs if they're looking around?

Jason Shah (01:07:37):
I would suggest Polygon, Salon, or MoonPay. I know it's three, but I wanted to give some breath in the Web3 space that might be exciting to people.

Lenny (01:07:45):
Great, great choices. What's a favorite TV show or movie that you've recently watched?

Jason Shah (01:07:48):
The Ken Burns Vietnam War series. I'm really into documentaries and history, and it's a really kind of compelling version of history that I've never seen before.

Lenny (01:07:58):
Awesome. Love that. Okay. Favorite interview question that you like to ask.

Jason Shah (01:08:02):
What is a risk you regret not taking, why, and what did you learn about yourself?

Lenny (01:08:08):
What do you look for in an answer there?

Jason Shah (01:08:10):
I think the biggest thing I look for is a growth mindset, to be able to reflect on an experience like that and be vocally self-critical without unproductively being hard on one's self, and I think that the dimension of asking about risk gets at their psychology and how do they think about not only their career, but if they were to work with me, how would they approach problem solving and taking bets on the business.

Lenny (01:08:33):
Awesome. Okay, final question. What's your least favorite vegetable?

Jason Shah (01:08:36):
Broccoli. I just removed some from a pizza last night that I really didn't want to eat.

Lenny (01:08:41):
Wow. Oh wow, okay. Even like steamed, cook, all the things?

Jason Shah (01:08:45):
There are no circumstances under which I'm excited about broccoli.

Lenny (01:08:49):
Oh man, you got to eat those veggies.

Jason Shah (01:08:51):
I know. I'm working on it.

Lenny (01:08:52):
Okay, Jason, this was amazing. Lived up to what I was hoping our second episode would be. Definitely better than our first which we'll leave on the cutting room floor. Two last questions. Where can people find you online? I assume Alchemy's hiring, so maybe pointing people there. And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Jason Shah (01:09:08):
Yeah, definitely. So, if you're interested in Alchemy and Web3, go to alchemy.com and click through to our jobs page from there. I'm online @0xShah. That is my crypto pseudonymous handle and happy to engage with folks there. And in terms of being helpful to me, I would love any feedback on anything that came up. I would love any products that people are working on. I also invest, and we also partner with a lot of products and teams at Alchemy, and I would love to meet anybody that's listening on the podcast too because I know Lenny's all about community and has kind of given so much back over the years that I would love to meet folks that are out there and get a chance to spend time talking about the products that you're all building.

Lenny (01:09:46):
Awesome. Thanks, Jason.

Jason Shah (01:09:48):
Thanks, Lenny.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I've been getting so many asks for go-to-market help.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:00:03):
With AI, it's just intensified because you have 10 players pursuing the same market opportunity and so your ability to actually bring the product to market to differentiate yourself from the competition has become more strategically important than it was previously.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
I had Jenna Abel on the podcast recently, one of her tips is you don't want to be focusing on here's the pain and problem we're solving and instead focus on here's how you will be better than your competitors.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:00:27):
80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to increased upside, which is a good thing for startup founders to understand. We all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future, but that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. For everybody else, particularly enterprises. You're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target next quarter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
I've heard a lot about how you think about go-to-market as a product.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:00:55):
We buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them. The experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the merchant. And so then you really want to create a customer buying journey that feels like very unique experiences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:17):
Something I've heard from so many people you've worked with is that your superpower is building a sales org that doesn't feel like a sales org to engineers.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:01:23):
The litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:38):
Today my guest is Jeanne Grosser. Jeanne was chief product officer at Stripe where she built their very early sales team from the ground up. She's currently COO at Versel where she oversees marketing, sales, customer success, revenue ops and field engineering. Jeanne has built world-class go-to-market teams at multiple unicorns and has advised dozens of companies on doing the same. In our conversation, we go deep on what a world-class go-to-market team looks like, including what the heck is go-to-market, the rise of the go-to-market engineer and how this role is already enabling her team to operate 10 times faster. A bunch of very specific tactics to level up your go-to-market skills, a primer on segmentation, how to think about your go-to-market process like a product, her favorite go-to-market tools, her hot takes on PLG and sales comp and sales hiring, and so much more. If you are looking to get smart on the latest and greatest in go-to-market thinking, this episode is for you.

(00:02:34):

(00:03:14):
This episode is brought to you by Datadog, now home to Epo, the leading experimentation and feature flagging platform. Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog, the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX, friction and business impact.

(00:03:32):
It starts with product analytics where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention, and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus experiments, prove what works. I saw this first hand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong and the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Epo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with Heatmaps and Scrollmaps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags, that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics. It's where great product teams learn faster.

(00:04:25):
Fix smarter and ship with confidence. Request a demo at datadoghq.com slash Lenny. That's datadog hq.com/Lenny. This episode is brought to you by Lovable. Not only are they the fastest growing company in history, I use it regularly and I could not recommend it more highly. If you've ever had an idea for an app but didn't know where to start, Lovable is for you. Lovable lets you build working apps and websites by simply chatting with AI. Then you can customize it at automations and deploy it to live domain. It's perfect for marketers spitting up tools, product managers, prototyping new ideas, and founders launching their next business. Unlike NoCo Tools, Lovable isn't about static pages. It builds full apps with real functionality and it's fast. What used to take weeks, months or years, you can now do over a weekend. So if you've been sitting on an idea, now is the time to bring it to life. Get started for free at Lovable.dev. That's Lovable.dev.

(00:05:29):
Jean, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:05:32):
Thanks for having me. Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:34):
What I wanted to get out of this conversation by the end of this to basically have this conversation be the thing that we send people when they're like, "I want to get better go to market. I'm trying to figure out what to do and get to market." We send them this versus having to hire someone for a lot of money and usually they can't find amazing people, because they're all snatched up. So let me start with just the basics. When people hear at the term go to market, what does that mean? What does that encompass?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:05:57):
I think there are two answers to this. Often what people think of is sort of the tip of the spear of what drives revenue, which is marketing and sales. For me, I think of it as any function that is going to touch a customer or make a dollar, and actually my remit at Vercel is that, so that includes marketing, sales, all of your technical sales roles like sales engineers or post-sales platform architects is what we call them at Vercel. It's customer success, it's support, it's partnerships. And the reason I say that is my experience throughout my career has been that those functions often have this Venn diagram strategy where marketing's pursuing one thing, it overlaps with what sales is pursuing, but not perfectly, which also overlaps with what support is pursuing but not perfectly. Examples of this would be slightly differing segmentation frameworks, et cetera.

(00:06:57):
And so one of the things I think you're going to want to see more in this particular moment is that that become a really integrated lifecycle. In particular, I think we're going to see a lot of the functions of go-to-market get redefined, so we've gone through a period of hyper-specialization in go-to-market depending on how you count them. There are, I think somebody quoted 17 different roles within go-to-market these days and I hypothesize that a lot of those are going to start to collapse. And so if you think of go-to-market more holistically, I think you can kind of go back to what are the jobs to be done from making a customer prospect aware of your product all the way through to high LTV, five years on the platform, fully wall-to-wall, and you're going to want to map that out and orchestrate it the way you would think about that within your own product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:54):
Awesome. We're going to go through that whole cycle of go-to-market, but so is it safe to say just for most companies that are especially starting out when they say go-to-market, that mostly is sales and then there's marketing as maybe a smaller fraction of that and then as you become more advanced and grow, customer success plays into it, tech sales, things like that?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:12):
Yeah, that's probably where most start is getting sales or frankly just because a lot of companies also start PLG, you might actually start with marketing and then you're layering in sales when it's time to do the sales assistant and ultimately sales led portions. So I think it can, depending on your product and your initial target market, it can either mean marketing or sales or a combination of those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):
Awesome. So essentially it's like the term go-to-market tells you what we're talking about. How do you take your product to market, get people aware of it, using it, sticking with it?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:42):
Yep, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:44):
What has most changed in the world of go-to-market over the last few years? You've done this for a long time at Google, at Stripe, you built it for sales team, now you're doing that at Vercel. What's changed most in the skill and art of go-to-market?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:55):
There are a number of things. So when consumption-based business models started, I think you saw go-to-market shift into being meaningfully more consultative because often that first land was the very beginning of the journey and represented a very small percent of what you were ultimately going to do with that customer. And so you had to go from being transactional to a lot more. You had to more deeply understand what that customer was trying to do so you could align that ultimately to your product. I think that has played out that much more with an AI because right now everyone knows they need to change, but they don't necessarily know exactly what they need to change to, whether that's their customer-facing product or their internal productivity and workflows. And so I think you're seeing a lot more of go-to-market orgs leaning into the art of the possible best practices, helping you actually think things through as if they were a consultant.

(00:09:52):
And so one of the things you see more of right now is forward-deployed engineering, which on some level is kind of a rebrand of professional services but kind of not. And a big part of that is, hey, how do I actually get into your environment, ride alongside you better understand what you're trying to do and then help you actually bring the technology to life and learn a lot along the way.

(00:10:18):
Often you're not only making that customer successful, but you're then taking all of that back to your product and engineering organization to figure out, okay, what was generalizable that we ought to build into our offering versus what is something that ultimately is going to be more of a professional service in the fullness of time. So I think that has been a biggie, is actually just really getting embedded with your customer. And then unsurprisingly, I think bringing AI to bear on the sales process is another big one. And so you've seen the rise in probably the last 18 to 24 months of the go-to-market engineer, which different folks define slightly differently, but it's kind of bringing one technical prowess to bear on go-to-market in general so you can have a lot better tooling, data use, et cetera. And then two, increasingly bringing AI to bear as well to re-architect your workflows and also make it so that it's easier to have a personalized experience with customers but do so at scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):
Amazing. Okay, let's follow the thread on this go-to-market engineer, so what was it like before and what are these engineers doing at companies?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:11:33):
So I think maybe an interesting story to tell. When I was at Stripe, we went to launch an outbound SDR function. So outbound prospecting and Stripe always ran lean. The company at that time had an operating principle which was efficiency is leverage. And so if you looked at the sales organization I was running, most companies out there probably would've had 30 SDRs and I was going to get four. So there's no way I was going to do the typical SDR approach and be successful. And so we thought to ourselves, okay, what can we do? We'll be super data-driven. And so we went and we started building project Rosland. Rosland is the scientist who originally mapped A-DNA. And what this was was effectively a company universe. So you can think of this as a massive database. Every row was a different company on the planet and every column was an attribute about that company that would help you sell to them in a more targeted fashion.

(00:12:39):
So at Stripe an example would be knowing that their business model was a marketplace was super helpful, because that would mean you wanted to sell Stripe Connect versus vanilla payments. And so the goal was basically, hey, can we create a mad Libs where I will come up with sort of a predefined email template, but 80% of it will be fill in the blank based on the different attributes of that customer. So if they're this industry or this business model, then pull this customer, reference this value prop, send it to this persona, not that. And we were trying to do this in 2017 and it was very hard and didn't actually totally work our ability to the false positive rate and we worked deeply with DSI and it just never really got there. And now that we're literally redoing here at Vercel as we speak and it actually works and you can bring AI to bear on it.

(00:13:41):
And so what's different is we now, I have a data scientist just like I did back in 2017, but I have a go-to-market engineer whereas before I just had someone in systems that was helping me configure outreach or sales off and my go-to-market engineer is helping me build an agent where we're coming up with, okay, well what's the human workflow that you would've done? And then how do you encode that using Vercel workflows as an example in actual code that's both deterministic and less so where an agent's going out and trying to replicate what a human might've done to produce that, fill in the blank, matlit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:21):
I love the ambition of that project. What is this, like eight years ago?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:14:25):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):
I love the big thinking there. We're going to map the entire universe of companies and then here's how we sell to them. And then just I'm trying to picture doing that without AI. It's like crazy to imagine trying that without AI and that's so much simpler to even imagine.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:14:38):
Well the thing that's amazing about that, just to geek out on a second, so I was working on that with a bunch of folks at Stripe on my team, obviously at a gentleman named Ben Salzman who went on to go to ZoomInfo and then actually recently just founded a go-to-market startup that is basically sort of productizing that concept of a company universe and then layering AI on it on top of it. And ultimately his view is actually AI will get to the point that you won't have to do outbound prospecting because it will just sort of company and product match. So it's fun to sort of see back in 2017 some of the folks doing that now work at OpenAI, they work at Anthropic, they also are doing GTM Eng. You've got him starting a totally AI native GTM company and then here I'm at Vercel trying to do the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):
Okay, so what's cool is this is an emerging role, an emerging skill that I don't think a lot of people have recognized as something that is happening. So one example I'm hearing of what this role does is they automate outbound emails essentially and outbound outreach. They figure out, they write workflows and agents that figure out here's the company to go after, here's how we message them. Does that end up being kind of like an email that's custom designed and written for this prospect?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:15:54):
That's one version. So it's broader than that really. Basically the full remit of GTM Eng will be to go through each of the different functions within go to market and break down all the different workflows that they do and then turn those into agents where AI is better placed than the human to do that task. So right now we started with actually inbound and are now moving to outbound because that workflow is most legible. And by legible I mean you can basically write it down. It's relatively replicable, mostly deterministic. So it's more likely that AI will do it well and we actually built the agent and then we keep a human in the loop. But from there we're starting to look at outbound and with an outbound we're starting more at the lower end of the market, where you tend to have slightly less customization because there's a single decision maker at the company.

(00:16:56):
But I think it'll take a while before we're able to really do that in a very large enterprise. There we might use an agent for research but maybe not all the way to actually send a message and that's just within the prospecting function. So other places that we're looking at this would be for install-based sales. So again there it's a little bit more deterministic because you've got awesome internal data on what a customer is and isn't using, what's the next best action? What's the thing they should get most value from? So that's where we're starting to map, hey, what does that ideal workflow look like? But basically you want to get to a state where as long as I've been in sales, they release these annual reports that help us all benchmark ourselves relative to one another. And one of the stats is what percent of time do your sellers actually spend in front of customers?

(00:17:44):
And for the 20 years I've been in sales, it's always been somewhere around 30% to 40%. So the minority of time is actually talking to other humans and I think we're getting to a point where with layering in agents, ideally we finally get salespeople to a point where they're actually spending 70% of their time interacting with humans and we can get the research, the follow-up, the things that are a little bit more rote and don't use the entirety of your human capacity done by an agent and then sort of unleash you to go deeper with your customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:17):
I love that this is such a great example of where AI is contributing in a very meaningful high ROI way, taking on all this work that people... like, you have to hire say 50 SDRs as you described to do and now you could do with a lot more. So it's a really cool example of leverage that AI gives you. One thing that I know a lot of people think about when they hear this is, okay, I'm going to get more of these really bad emails trying to pitch me on stuff and just like this isn't going to work. I can tell this is AI. What have you learned about how to do this where people actually receive emails that actually convert and do well?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:18:51):
Our processes all always have human in the loop. And so basically where we'll start is we take a go to market engineer and we have them shadow the highest performing individual in that function. And so you can go and you shadow an SDR and you can see, oh wow, they've got seven tabs open. They're looking up the person on LinkedIn, they're reading about the company, they're doing chatGPT on this, they're looking in this database to get these sets of attributes. And so that's how you sort of inform the initial workflow. And then what we do is we let the agent make a call. So in the specific example with inbound, you have to determine whether or not you think the lead is likely to be qualified and then you have to determine what to say to it. And so we'll let the agent make those two calls.

(00:19:44):
It ultimately then does some deep research, pulls in a bunch of information from our databases and crafts a response, but we have a human review all of those and actually hit send. Now for us, we had 10 SDRs doing this inbound workflow and now we just have one that is effectively QA-ing the agent. The other nine we deployed on outbound, so we got to move them up the value chain. At some point I think we'll get to a place where we feel like, "Hey, the human reviewer is saying yes enough of the time that we feel confident that these will be on brand targeted, et cetera," but right now we're still trying to train the agent and it incorporates feedback on what we choose to reject, edit, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:31):
And you shared that it's already having a lot of impact. Like you said, you had 10 SDRs and now one can do the job of 10.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:20:39):
So before we did that move, I mean the other thing that's just incredible about this is the person who built the lead agent was a single GTM engineer. He spent maybe 25-30% of his time on this. It was six weeks before we felt confident going from 10 to one. So it wasn't like this was a multi-quarter process, it actually moved super quickly and then again now we just sort of keep that agent manager working with the agent to get it to a point where we say, "Hey, we're ready to roll." Actually throughout the process we also tracked all of the KPIs that you typically would hold an SDR accountable to. We were looking at our lead to opportunity conversion rate, we're looking at the number of touches it takes the time to convert, and basically what we were able to do is hold that lead to opportunity conversion rate flat. So the agent is as good as our humans were, but it's actually condensed the number of touches it takes to convert because it's so much quicker at responding relative to leads inevitably sitting in the queue or coming in at nighttime and no one can get to it, that type of deal. So that's sort of when we knew it was ready to pull nine people off and shift them into outbound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):
That's incredible. Okay, that's interesting. So you shift them to outbound. What I love about this is this SDR that is now doing this is, as you said, doing the things they enjoy more, they're talking to customers more, they're not doing all this kind of top of funnel rote work. I don't want to get into whole jobs AI discussion, but there's always been this talk about AI SDRs basically replacing SDRs. It feels like that's one thing where everyone's like this is a hundred percent going to be AI in the future. What I'm hearing here is it gives one Aster a lot more leverage and obviously you still need people running the show. Thoughts there? Just like do you think AI will replace all this at some point? And then I don't know, you don't need salespeople?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:22:32):
I think on prospecting it can replace a fair amount because the average SDR wasn't doing overly sophisticated research in the first place. So where I, think the last part to go as I mentioned will be in deep enterprise prospecting where you can be at multiple layers in an org chart, you've got to pick between business lines, you've got to triangulate those. But I do think for the things that are more repetitive that often don't take that much time to learn and get ramped, AI will be good at that. And in my view, no one graduated from college and was like, "Yes, I just went to college for four years to become an SDR." It was more, "Okay, that's where you are forced to start." But I think the average SDR could have gone straight into outbound or straight into an SMB closing role. And so basically what we're just doing is shifting folks into something that uses more of their full capacity right out of the gates rather than sort of the forcing function of working your way up the totem pole.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:48):
Awesome. Since a lot of people listening to this aren't salespeople don't have a lot of background in sales, we've used this term SDR, there's also the term AE. Can you just help people understand what is an SDR, what do they do, what's an AE, and then what's the role above?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:24:01):
Sure. So SDR is typically in charge of generating pipeline. They're meant to talk to prospective customers and get them to a point where it is worth investing time to run them through a sales process. You typically have two types of an SDR, have an inbound one. So this is where people come to your website, they fill out contact sales, they'll be the first call to make sure that it's actually worth a more expensive account executive to go and run a sales process or you then have outbound. So this is where when you want to grow faster than your inbound demand, they will go out and at this point you probably have a point of view on where you think you have product market fit. And so they will target that part of the market and try to drum up interest from folks who weren't otherwise raising their hand saying, I'd like to talk to you.

(00:24:54):
So that's sales development basically. Pipeline generation account executives are closers. So it's their job to take somebody from, "Okay, hey, I'm interested in learning about your solution, I have a legitimate problem. I potentially could make a decision," to, "I now believe that your product is the best in the market for me and I'm willing to pay for it." And then account executives, depending on the segments that your company sells into E.G. small business, mid-market enterprise, et cetera, they may work their way up the food chain from selling to a smaller company like an SMB or a startup. Those tend to be a little bit more of a transactional sale. You often have a single decision maker to then going into a mid-market or a commercial role where now maybe you have an economic buyer like somebody in finance and a technical buyer like somebody in engineering to getting into enterprise where you have procurement and you have committees and 10 people have to weigh in and you've got to help them figure out how to de-risk the fact that they're probably migrating from something so much more complicated coordination effort to sell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):
That was extremely helpful. So SDR, pipeline generation, i.e., closer. Such a simple way of thinking about it. Okay, this is great. Going back to the GDM engineer, a few questions for people that may want to try this at their company, what scale do you think it makes sense to start hiring for this role? Having someone automate in the go-to-market process?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:26:25):
What's interesting about this is it will force companies to be more rigorous about their sales process early. So often startups when they go from founder led sales to say, I'm going to have my first sales person, whether that's an actual account executive who has sales experience or your general athlete, wicked smart, who's going to go figure it out. Often founders will just say, "Okay, sales is showing up and talking to people. Isn't that what I just did for the last couple of years?" But actually sales is more than that. It's a skill just like writing code as a skill or building a financial model as a skill, it's about discovery. So asking all the right questions that help you identify challenges in pain, willingness to pay, et cetera, and then going through a process to handle those objections and showcase where are you at enough value such that somebody ultimately wants to hand over some money.

(00:27:24):
So often startups will get, particularly ones with strong product market fit to pretty significant scale without really having a replicable process. And you can't really apply go to market engineering unless you actually have a point of view on what best practice should look like. And so I think basically this is going to force folks to have more of a playbook out of the gates, what's working, what's not? Can I document it? Do I have content for the different parts of the sales process? And then once you do that, which maybe 10 people is a good size and scale for that, ostensibly a GTM engineer can come in and turn that into an agent. You could also argue that if you're a founder who wants to bring in a general athlete profile and that person is technically minded, that you could have a hybrid AE GTM engineer who figures out what their best practice is and then tries to turn that into an agent that's riding alongside them and making them more effective as well.

(00:28:26):
So I don't know that I have a point of view yet on what's the optimal size and scale, but I forever have given founders the advice that you often want to bring in revenue operations, which is basically the analytical arm of sales earlier than you think because having data, having process is actually what gives you insights as a founder into what is and isn't working. And so I would argue just like it's a good idea to have that sooner than later, increasingly it'll probably be a good idea to have GTM engine and be looking to bring agents to bear on your process at the outset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:05):
While we're on this topic, just a quick tangent, the advice for hiring your first salesperson that I usually hear is wait until you're around a million in ARR. When you have a repeatable process, you can teach someone anything there. Does that seem right? What would you recommend?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:29:18):
Yeah, I think that seems about right. I do think as a founder you want to stay deeply connected to customers and get it to a scale and get it to a point where you use the word, there's some repeatability there. I think that's one of the things that not all founders get right is founders are incredible salespeople. They convinced a VC angel investors to fork over a bunch of money, so clearly they're going to inspire people to buy. But if you're getting to a million in ARR and the set of customers you have look nothing like one another, you still have very much like an evangelist sale, very much founder led sale versus if you can say, "Hey, I now have an ICP here, or ideal customer profile, e.g something you can write down. We are good. Our product fits with startups with less than a hundred employees who are typically building SaaS applications," something like that.

(00:30:14):
Then you're probably ready to hand over the reins. And then what founders have to remember is to actually hand over the reins. So you've got to enable the person who comes in, what is it that you're doing effectively, what's your content, what are the discovery questions you are asking? How are you handling objections so you can transition that knowledge but also don't handle them over entirely. You want to stay connected to the customer because you still have a fair amount of R&D to do to figure out where is the product next going to resonate, where are you getting stock as you scale, etc.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):
To close the loop on the go-to-market engineer, what's the profile of the ideal go-to-market engineer, may be your first.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:30:57):
What we have found works really well is somebody who does have go-to-market experience. So at Vercel, our first three go-to-market engineers we're actually sales engineers. So Vercel hires very technical sales engineers, all of them were front end developers before they decided they wanted to get into sales. And so we just said, "Hey, three of you, congrats." You're now founding members of our GTM Eng team. And the thing that works well there is you do understand aspects of what is good GTM, what does a process look like? It's been really interesting actually. So the gentleman who runs GTM Eng for me, we were going through this lead agent and QA-ing it. And so I'm going and I'm looking at some of the responses that we've ultimately had the lead agent send and realized, "Oh, I wouldn't have sent that and that's because I have 20 years of sales experience and we modeled the lead agent off our best person, but our best person who has two years of sales experience." So it actually is important to understand the art and the science of sales and how you bring best practice to bear. Either you've done it and so you know some best practice or you're going to geek out on sales, read a bunch of books, learn a thing or two, and try to incorporate some of those into your agent development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:28):
That is really interesting. So come from the sales side, not from the engineering side. And I imagine this is such a cool opportunity for salespeople to do something completely different and move closer to engineering.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:32:38):
Yeah, I mean we're having a lot of fun with it. At Vercel in particular, we basically get to be customer zero. So everything that we're building with agents, we're building on Vercel's AI cloud. So these agents now have multiple steps that they go through. So we're using Vercel's workflow SDK and workflow offering. We use the AI gateway to call the different models that we use to do deep research or other enrichment that we do. So for us it's great because we basically sort of bang on everything the engineering team is building and get to go be a discerning customer before we actually get it out the door to real customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:22):
What a fun time to be alive. I could tell the fun that you guys are having, just from the way you describe it.

(00:33:29):
Stripe handles the massive scale and complexity of many of the world's fastest growing enterprises, including 78% of the Forbes AI 50 and more than half of the Fortune 100 enterprises like Atlassian, Figma and Urban Outfitters use Stripe to create fully branded and customized checkout pages with access to more than 125 global payment methods. There's a reason I've had more leaders from Stripe on this podcast than any other company. They know how to build great products that scale and that people love. And Stripe is a lot more than payments. They've also got a category leading billing solution and a highly optimized checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Join the ranks of industry leaders like Salesforce, OpenAI and Pepsi that are using Stripe to grow faster and to grow the world's GDP, learn how Stripe can help your business grow at Stripe.com. Zooming out a little bit in terms of you mentioned tools and tools that you use. I'm curious just what are kind of the state of the art tools within the go-to-market stack that you love that you'd recommend?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:34:33):
Well, so I'm going to have an interesting answer to this, so I'll give you one. And it's not state-of-the-art per se, although I don't mean that disparagingly, it's just that it's been around for a while now and a lot of folks use it, but I think Gong has gotten just meaningfully more interesting in the last year. And then second half of my question I will get into, I think the calculus on build versus buy is changing. So all right, Gong. Gong is incredible because you can run agents against it now. So we take all of our Gong transcripts and we dump them into an agent called the deal-bott, and that deal-bott then can do a bunch of things. So the first thing we had it do was lost opportunity review. So we had just finished Q2, we had a list of our top losses for the quarter sorted by deal size, and we ran it against that and it was incredibly interesting.

(00:35:39):
So the biggest loss that quarter according to the account executive was lost on price. And when you ran the agent over every Slack interaction, every email, every GONG call, it said actually you lost because you never really got in touch with an economic buyer. And when you talked to somebody about ROI and total cost of ownership, it was clear from their reaction that they didn't really buy your mass. And so really the reason we lost was an inability to demonstrate value, which upon reflection I've got work to do to build out how we quantify the value of Vercel, which actually is very easily quantifiable. It's one of the things I love about selling this product, but we got to codify that for the go-to-market team. So that was incredibly interesting and now we run it against all of our lost opportunities and actually do a much better job of categorizing why it was we really, really lost.

(00:36:38):
And then either feeding that back into the engineering team or back into marketing sales leadership on, hey, where are we falling short in the sales process? And so that was awesome, but then we're like, well, it's not very fun to lose, so why don't we pull that forward? And so we went from lost bot to deal-bott and now the deal-bott is running in real time and we basically feed insights into Slack. Vercel is incredibly heavy users of Slack, so we have a channel for every single customer, either opportunity or existing one. And so now we're feeding insights into that Slack channel which is, "Hey, you're this far into the sales process and you haven't talked to an economic buyer, you should think about that." Or, "Hey, you just got off that call with an economic buyer, didn't sound like it went that well. Here's some things to consider and how you might follow-up."

(00:37:34):
And last thing before I pause, the other thing that's really interesting and how we're using this too is we are in this moment where I have never seen an iteration velocity exists now in my career. My 20 plus year career has all been in tech. And so for go-to-market teams, that's really hard. If you are launching something every other day, the ability to be enabled on that is actually quite challenging. And so this bot agent is now also letting us, where we're starting to go with it is we'll release something, we'll do our best to enable the team, then we'll go run the agent across calls, interactions, and we'll diagnose where we did a bad job of objection handling, where we're getting stuck. And then at the end of the week we can have a huddle and say, okay, what are all the places that our agent would suggest we aren't selling effectively?

(00:38:34):
And then almost like an engineering team, we'll now run sprints, which is like those are just bugs. They're bugs in your go-to-market process, so you should not have them. And by the next week we're going to add content to our objection handling to guide. We're going to add content to a discovery guide, we're going to figure out something we need to change about our demo, so on and so forth. So that's early. That's a little bit of a preview, but that's where we're talking about taking things right now within our go-to-market orgs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:00):
Jeanne, you're blowing my mind in so many ways, it just sounds so fun and just you guys are going to win is what I'm feeling when I hear all this. Incredible. What I love about this is this AI tool, this agent you built sees things that humans were not seeing. The fact that you were surprised of just like this is a completely different conclusion is such a big deal. This is the whole promise of ai, it's going to do things we aren't even thinking about or capable of.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:39:26):
It is. We had a really interesting, one of the things we're doing at Vercel, we have an AI cloud, so people use that to put AI-native features into their customer-facing applications, but they're also using it to build internal applications to improve productivity or outcomes. And we are talking to a very large airline and that airline obviously gets tons and tons of support queries. So of course they would want to go apply AI to hey, how can we have AI answer these so that our cost to support goes down, sort of the obvious thing. But the more interesting conversation was actually with one of the C-level executives who said, we also actually transcribe every single one of those support calls. And so what I really want to know is why are they calling and how do I make it so that fewer people call the next week? And so again, this is now with AI, you can rapidly go through all of that content and actually be able to much more quickly than having a human in your CRM sort of pick some status why it was that folks were calling the airline this week and what if anything you can do to make it less the case next week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:39):
I imagine many people hearing this are like, "I need one of these deal-botts and lost bots." These are all internal products that you all built?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:40:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:47):
Is there anything that you've learned about making them this good? Any tips you can share of here's how to make a really good bot for sales?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:40:54):
Yes, so actually that's the second half of my answer that I forgot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):
That's perfect.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:41:00):
Which is sort of like bill versus buy calculus. So I think one of our learnings is that it's not that hard to build these agents and they aren't that expensive either. So I mentioned the lead agent that was a six-week process with one human, a third of his time, that deal-bott, the lost bot version was two days basically we riffed on it, he had it 40 hours later. Now we're continuing to refine it for the other things I mentioned. And what's also interesting about them is they for better or for worse for Vercel, but that lead agent which runs full stack on Vercel, will cost us about a thousand dollars to run for the entire year. If you remember I told you we had 10 people in the SDR function, so I'm paying well over a million dollars for that from a salary perspective.

(00:41:57):
I got that down to one. And then behind that I have a lead agent that costs a thousand bucks. So that's like a 90%-plus reduction in total cost there. And there's lots of software for agents out there right now. And I think one of the things we're learning is because this whole space is so nascent, often your own esoteric context, your content, your workflow is really key to unlocking the power of the agent. And so I think there's real value in experimenting with your own internal agent development. We may ultimately end up on better integrated agent platforms in the fullness of time, or we may find that the CIO increasingly goes from a procurer of software to a builder of software and you'll have an AI internal platform with a thousand agents running across your org. I'm not really sure yet. But I certainly think there's value in trying it yourself because you may find that it's meaningfully easier than you think and you get returns pretty quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:10):
So what I'm hearing here is that you're finding that there are not tools out there to plug and play. The alpha is essentially in building your own stuff.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:43:18):
I think that's partially true, and I think because you also have all these tools proliferating right now, you get into the perennial problem where you wind up with 20 of them to do the 20 jobs to be done basically, rather than an integrated platform that's doing all of them. I'm hearing this a lot actually when I'm talking to customers right now where their biggest issue in deploying AI is actually just getting through procurement and it's because got an AI mandate, you kind of have a blank check. I recently heard the term of instead of ARR, it's ERR, which is experimental run rate revenue, which is to say everyone's out there sort of, Hey, we're going to give this thing a go for a year and then TBD on whether or not we keep it. But basically you're having to procure 20 different things. Most things are getting off the ground and so they're solving something relatively narrow and that'll change in the fullness of time. But I do think there's an opportunity to figure out, hey, where do I likely have a more specific workflow internally. For that it might be worth building your own agent and then maybe for the things that are a little bit more generalizable, you go get something off the shelf.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:34):
Are there any platforms or tools that you want to shout out that allow you to build these agents so quickly? I know they sit on Versel, so shout out Vercel. But just anything that you point people to you to... These SDR, these GTM engineers, they're former salespeople. Are they learning to code? Are they byte coding these agents? How does that work?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:44:52):
So our sales engineers all have CS degrees. So they were engineers in a sales capacity, so they're writing code and actually these agents, they're building directly on Versel. So you get the AI gateway that lets you call different models. You have a sandbox if you're running untrusted code, you've got workflows that let you build the process. You've got fluid compute, which lets you really efficiently use compute when you only need it. So we're just sort of building it from the ground up here. Again, it's not that hard. Now you do need to write code for that. Certainly there are a lot of vibe coding tools out there that also give you more workflow builders that are somewhere between fully WYSIWYG, almost like drag and drop and a little bit more code forward. So you've got a bunch out there along those lines. But I do think we've sort of found one of the reasons actually the GTM Eng team at Versel can build these agents so easily is because the Versel platform is making it that easy to use our framework to find infrastructure and get that agent onto into production very rapidly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:11):
What a neat, unfair advantage you all have to do this stuff.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:46:13):
Yes, it is fun to... I mean, I do think this company is better than any I've seen at eating its own dog food and just everyone is constantly, we say Versel builds Versel with Versel. So you're just always looking for ways to, Hey, how can we use our product to go do what we need to do? And as a result, either understand then what a customer would want or what's missing from our product that we could go make better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):
Along these lines, something that's already come across a lot in the way that you described this stuff is I've heard a lot about how you think about go-to-market as a product. A lot of people listening to this, as I've said, are product builders. So I think this is a really nice way of thinking about go-to-market. I'm guessing you've already talked about elements of this, but just what's a way to think about go-to-market as a product?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:46:56):
Yeah, I've always, so I had this realization probably a little over a decade ago in my career. So my first job out of college was working on Gmail in 2004. So Gmail launched on April 1st, I joined on June 1st. And as I'm sure you'll remember as well, Gmail was this incredible innovation, massive JavaScript application that didn't really exist at the time. And it had this gig of storage. It was a full year before Yahoo Mail caught up and even longer before Hotmail and others did. So that was the level of technical differentiation between Gmail and the next best. And a decade later, you had cloud computing enabling folks to do stuff that you never would've been able to do previously. And so I kind of felt like, huh, software's starting to commoditize a little bit. And so when that happens, when technical differentiation kind of narrows, what are other things that will differentiate you?

(00:48:01):
And I was started thinking outside of tech, we buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them. And so I started to develop this thesis that actually the experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the margin. And so if you believe that, then you really want to create a customer buying journey that feels like very unique experiences. And so we did a lot of this at Stripe and now we're looking to replicate this here. But an example of one of the things I think we did really nicely at Stripe was a lot of companies sales, the first call after you're qualified, we've decided you're worth engaging in sales process is discovery, which is basically let me ask you a lot of questions to try to under-uncover paint, figure out where buying power lies, et cetera.

(00:49:03):
And so that is kind of boring sometimes for a customer. You're basically being quizzed often on the phone. And so what we started to do at Stripe was that first session was a whiteboarding session, and we would actually get together and have you draw your architecture for payments and all the other things that were under the hood to enable you to take money and drive customer outcomes. And through that we would learn a ton about what was in your stack, what we were going to have to compete with, displace where value lied. But the customer also learned a lot themselves because in many cases they'd never drawn their architecture diagram. And so they left that meeting with an asset and a sense of like, "Wow, this is a really collaborative person who's deeply interested in helping me develop a mental model for how to think about this." And then we had other things that we would do.

(00:50:00):
So that's sort of how I think about building go-to-market-like a product is basically you need to go through from the first time you become aware that the company exists to again, that sort of five-year heavily retained wall-to-wall customer a set of experiences. And those experiences can feel transactional, flat, boring, or they can feel very human, personalized and unique. And so we try to go map those out and figure out how do you bring the product to bear, make it really human, and hopefully that creates a customer for life in the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
I love that whiteboarding example. Are there any other examples of what you've done to make it actually work really well in this way?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:50:43):
Yeah. Another principle, we really developed this at Stripe too and I brought it to Vercel, was just the idea of adding value at any touch point regardless of whether or not that customer bought. Because even if customers don't buy, you often find that if you miss them on that buying cycle, three or four years later when they're in another buying cycle, they do come back. I was at Stripe for nine years and so I saw the number of customers that we lost and then half a decade later, here they are and they bought. So that was sort of another one. So examples of this that were doing at Vercel is there's great data on the internet that helps people understand the performance of their website and how fast your website is actually impacts SEO. And SEO impacts AEO and everybody's thinking about AEO right now. And, so one of the things we try to do when we reach out is actually give folks insight immediately into how they're performing on an absolute basis, how they're performing relative to peers. So ideally that piques your interest and you want to learn more from us, but even if it doesn't, you still have insights that you may or may not have been aware of that maybe make you contemplate whether or not you've got the optimal setup.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:07):
Awesome. So what I'm hearing here is when you say, think of it like a product that's basically a product person thinks about the experience of their product, that every step of the journey, here's the flow, step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how do we make every step awesome, keep them going along that journey. And so what you think about is just from the prospect's perspective, how do we make every step of that journey awesome, continue them down that journey.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:30):
Yeah. How do you make it be an experience rather than a transaction

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:35):
Versus just feel like sales coming at you trying to sell you stuff?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):
Okay. Staying along this track of staying tactical, I want to go even further there. So what are just some go-to-market tactics that you find really effective these days for people trying to just to be more successful in getting people to pay attention to their stuff, to buy their stuff?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:57):
I mean, one I would sort of say dovetails with where I just ended, but is what are the unique insights that you can bring to bear about your product or how that customer may be in a suboptimal state? So I do think investing in data to tease that out is one thing. I think the other thing this is straightforward but often not done enough is a lot of good companies invest in docs, good thing to do, but they stop there. And particularly if you are selling into a slightly larger company doing things like, AWS calls it well-architected guides or blueprints, a lot of customers, particularly larger ones, really want to know the best practice for how exactly to implement your product with their particular setup. A great example of this, this is from Stripe, was Stripe was excellent at marketplaces. Most, Lyft, Instacart, DoorDash, they were all on Stripe.

(00:54:07):
And so Stripe definitely knew the best way to set up payments for a marketplace because we'd seen them all. And so when you then would go and sell a marketplace and say, "Oh yeah, we've got docs, go check them out." They didn't like that, because they're like, "Hey, every marketplace runs on Stripe. I don't want to look at generic docs. I want you to tell me what's the best way to set up payments for a marketplace." And so I think that's another key thing to be doing, particularly as you move past that sort of solo developer startup founder as potentially a target audience.

(00:54:39):
And then, I don't know if this is a tactic per se, but I do think just a good reminder for founders in particular who are still in that maybe founder-led sales moment is just the value of really good discovery. I often find founders are so excited about talking about their product or you ask one question and now they've got a hook of like, oh, I can fix that for you. But excellent salespeople typically will talk well under half the time in a conversation because they're out asking questions, probing often helping a customer arrive at conclusions on their own. And so learning how to do five why's, go deep rather than immediately going into problem solving mode. If they ask a question, you respond often. If they ask a question, you should ask a question about the question and then respond. So learning to be great at that, I think differentiates people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:43):
So the last tip, I think there's something a lot of I bet everyone could learn is just listen more and talk less.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:55:48):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):
On that first piece of advice, this kind of sharing unique insights and how your suboptimal, is there an example you could share of how you did that? Maybe a story of just how you convinced someone you're selling Striper or Vercel like care or something you're missing. Here's how this could help you become much better.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:56:04):
So with Vercel, sort of giving an example, but I'll make it more specific. So the performance point, you can go and look at core web Vitals, and so we can actually see the different things within their site that are fast or load correctly, et cetera, so anyone can go look that up. But what we can do is actually then help with benchmarking relative to peers. So that's been a big one that we've gone out and done. The other one that we've spent some good time on is just around helping customers understand MCP servers and when it would make sense to use one. So I think those are all the rage, but often people don't know how to contemplate them within their own product. So that was another one that we've gone pretty deep on and then related to, the first one is AEO Answer engine optimization is actually somewhat tangential to Vercel right.

(00:57:09):
So we drive performance, performance drives SEO. SEO is an input into AEO, but we have spent a ton of time sharing insights on AEO because we ourselves focus deeply on it and think we understand it better than many. And so again, as part of just building a trusted relationship, folks may go from those AMAs or that content into, okay, great, you taught me a lot and therefore I want Vercel to help me with performance. But in many cases, they actually now are just like, "This is a company that seems insightful, it seems like one I can learn from, and now I'm going to pay a little bit more attention to them." And over the fullness of time, maybe they see something that triggers them to decide, "Now is the time I want to go investigate that aspect of Vercel."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:55):
Awesome. So what I'm hearing here in many ways, and this resonates, I had Jenna Abel on the podcast recently and it was all about sales skills and how to sell.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:58:02):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
And one of her tips is you don't want to be focusing on here's the pain and problem we're solving and instead focus on here's how you will be better than your competitors. Here's the big gap and alpha that you can achieve. If you use Vercel, you were missing out on speed and you're going to get screwed in AEO and all these things. Here's how you can architect your entire payments system to be top tier. Does that resonate?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:58:27):
Yeah, I was told this stat. It's round numbers, so I can't imagine it's entirely accurate, but basically that customers, 80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to the other one out of five to increase upside, which is a good thing again for startup founders to understand. So we all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future. It's very exciting. Everyone's visionaries, but that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. And for everybody else, particularly enterprises, you're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target next quarter, the risk of being outdone by the competition, the risk of having brand damage, et cetera. And so it's really hard actually for many startups to make that pivot because it feels off brand, but it does actually drive more buying behavior, is setting up a little bit of that concern that either I might not be well positioned or again through good question asking. I know exactly where I'm not well positioned and you can help me, that

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:53):
That is such an important stat you shared. This has come up actually before in this podcast that buying, people are buying in large part to reduce risks, to basically not hurt themselves in their career, not hurt the company. That's a bigger factor in the buying decision than, "I have this problem I need to solve. And okay, thank you, this is solving." And the way April Dunford came in the podcast and talked about this of just like it's such a massive career bet. We are going to bring in product X and it's going to become, like Stripe, let's say, let's not talk about Versel. But let's say Stripe, we're going to adopt Stripe. That's a huge decision. If it doesn't go well, your career is hurt, your manager is going to be mad at you, it's going to set your company back. So a lot of the buying decision, as you've said is I just don't want to screw this up.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:36):
Right. Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
Okay. Along the line of tactics, something that I know you're a big fan of and help people think about is segmentation.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:45):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
This is something a lot of founders struggle with. They know, "Okay, I need to figure out my segmentation strategy and here where we're going after." Can you just give us a primer on segmentation, what people should know about why this is important and then how they might approach this.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:59):
So segmentation is basically how do you carve up the world of companies that exist on the planet to reason about them where they buy differently? So I'll give examples from Stripe and Versel to bring this home. So a very typical company segmentation is small, medium, large. That's a rational way to do things. Small, you often have a single decision maker, medium, a small team, and large, it's complex, it's a committee, et cetera. So the buying process does change across SMB, mid-market enterprise, but if you stop there, you are likely missing. But what are the things within your offering that also change the way something gets sold? So at Stripe, there were two ways we further cut the business. Way one was, so think of segmentation as a graph. So X-Access was size, so small, medium, large, y-access was growth potential. And that was important for Stripe because it was a consumption-based business.

(01:02:10):
So if you were going to grow at 200% year-on-year, you were more valuable to Stripe than if you were going to grow at 8% year-on-year. And so we wanted to spend more time, spend more money going after the 200% growers than the 8%. So that was one that informed your strategy on who you targeted. And then for Stripe, the other thing that we cut it was business model. So are you a B2B? Are you B2C? Are you B2B2B, E.G. a platform or B2B2C, E.G. a marketplace and why is that relevant? Well, if you're B2B, you are going to need business payments. Credit card was useful for a PLG function or PLG sale, but you were going to need ACH wires, etc. And you probably had a recurring business, so you were going to want Stripe billing. If you were B2C, that's consumer.

(01:03:00):
So you're going to want consumer payments. Apple Pay is super important. If you were in the platform or the marketplace, you were going to buy our connect product. So it helped us basically then craft a more targeted and replicable sales. Vercel, sort of similar deals. So small, medium, large buying complexity. We also do the same thing on growth potential because we are similarly a consumption based business, but for us, a couple other things on the X-axis, we layer in promote, which is one of the things that is observable is traffic, site traffic on the internet. So Google publishes a Crux score, which is basically they have a bunch of data in Chrome, and so they know that Lenny's site gets a million XC amount-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:48):
Millions.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:03:48):
... volume that Jeanne's site does. And so basically if you are a small company but you have super high traffic that's going to be more complex, Vercel is going to make more money and so we want to promote you.

(01:04:02):
So great example of this would be OpenAI. OpenAI, I forget these days how many employees it has. Let's say it's 3,000, it's probably more than that at this point, but so that's going to put it in the mid-market at most companies, but they're a top 25 traffic site on the internet. So for us, that's going to push them in our enterprise because we need to go lean in with a much more in depth sales process. And then the other thing we layer on is a workload type. So if you are an e-commerce company, that's going to be a very different sale. You actually use different language. You talk about product listing pages and product description pages, and you've got an order management system as the back end. Super different from a crypto company where you might be running soup to nuts on AWS. And so again, that helps us start to then have a really different buying content for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):
Okay, this is awesome. So essentially what you do is you break up this universe coming back to your original story at Stripe to help you sort essentially which companies are most likely to buy your product. And what you're coming up with is these attributes that are correlated with they're likely to be great potential customers.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:05:22):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):
Do you recommend using this XY axis as the approach versus something else? There's like a spreadsheet with five columns. I don't know, how do you start?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:05:31):
There's probably something to be said for X and Y. like do you think size is going to play into most buying decisions and then these days there is a fair amount of consumption happening? So there'll be aspects of this that I think are somewhat universal. But I think basically when I came to Vercel, because new product market product offering, for me it's a new market. I had a lot to learn, but this is one of the first things I did in the first 30 days. And so basically I sat down with the gentleman Abhi who leads data science here and said, okay, what drives revenue? So what are the things that you can look at X ante about a customer to know this person's likely to pay us a hundred thousand dollars versus a million? That's probably going to be part of a segmentation framework. And then similarly, okay, what attributes would we look for to cluster where we seem to be winning repeatedly? And that was how we ultimately got at, okay, Crux rank is going to be super important because what you pay Vercel is correlated with your traffic. And then workload type was super important as well.

(01:06:46):
And for Vercel, when we did that, it was really interesting because we saw, wow, we have a lot of penetration and e-comm not that surprising actually, given that we drive highly performant sites and e-comm having a superfast performance site really matters. But at the time, if you looked at as an example, an enterprise SaaS companies, we didn't have a lot of penetration, even though you would've thought, okay, front-end cloud, very developer oriented. Of course software companies would be on us, but in enterprise, most of those companies built that SaaS offering before Vercel existed. So migrating 2 million lines of code to Vercel, that's a big lift. So it helped us really understand where are we winning, where are we not? And now as an example, within SaaS companies and enterprise, we're actually seeing a lot of interest in the AI cloud. Those are some of the earlier adopters of, "Hey, let's add AI native functionality to our existing SaaS app." And so again, it helps us figure out what to target where.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):
So essentially you're doing this regression analysis on what's working and then here's the attributes that are most correlated with success. Something I always recommend when founders ask me for how do I figure out my CPE? How do I figure out where to focus, my heuristic is just think of three attributes that narrow them down. So it's like series A company that's angel-led, that's the marketplace, something like that. Does that feel like a good just rule of thumb just to start?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:08:18):
Yeah, I think beyond three, that's getting pretty detailed and reasonably speaking, you're not going to cut. You have five sellers. So, what, you're going to put one seller in five different segments? So I do think three is something you can reason about. The other thing I'll say on this topic that I think is really important is a lot of times folks think segmentation is a go-to market thing. I really think it's a company thing. So when you Vercel, I actually deliver and every new hires first week, one of our company values is KYC, know your customer and I deliver the KYC section and talk through our segmentation framework how our customer base maps into those segments because it's really important as those new product managers leave the room that when they're building something, they think to themselves, okay, I'm building a new back end product. Who is this targeted at? Is it targeted at an enterprise or a startup? Basically, do I have a point of view on where I'm trying to win and why? And if you're doing that out of the gates, then it's much easier to then go speak the same language with the go to market org and figure out, okay, how are we going to take that to market in line with the other emotions that we have in play?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:36):
Okay, this is a great segue to, there's a couple other things I want to talk about. One is something I've heard from so many people you've worked with is that you are amazing at building a go-to-market org that works really well with product and engineering. So I'll read this quote from your former colleague, Kate Jensen. She said that your superpower is building a sales org that doesn't feel like a sales org to engineers. So the question she suggested asked just what does it take to do that? What are the ingredients to building a sales org that engineers and product teams really like working with?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:09:59):
The litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager. And what I'm trying to get across is you need to have incredible product depth. And the reason for that is twofold. One, it gives you credibility with the product and engineering org. And two, I also believe that the best go-to-market orgs on the planet are equal parts revenue driving and R&D and D. And the reason I emphasize the latter is if you think about a product management organization, you may have a UXR team out doing research, product managers certainly should be out talking to customers. Well, if I have a 20-person sales team, think of the number of customers that we talk to in a week. And so if we can do an excellent job of translating all of that feedback into signal and then feeding that into the road map, we can be actually an extension of the product management org. But that takes being really good at discerning signal from noise, understanding when something is an objection that should be overcome versus an opportunity in the market. So I think those things have helped.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:27):
I just love this as a product manager, maybe form a product manager. I don't know what the hell I am these days. I just love the idea of the salesperson. Like you not knowing the difference between a product manager and a salesperson. The most classic challenge is sales orgs ask for all these features and PMs are constantly having to push back and think about does this fit into everything. So it feels like that's a big part of this is to understand that deeply.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:11:51):
Yeah, you want a sales org that can think like a general manager, so that's not just trying to get deals done but is trying to help build a business. And so again, knows when to say no, knows when to do objection handle versus knows, Hey, I've actually heard this on the last three calls and I do think this would be a really big unlock that would make us more competitive, would be something that new that nobody's doing. So I think that takes looking for a profile that both has sales skills but also is going to think with that product mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):
I love that. Okay, so another quote from Claire Hughes Johnson, former podcast guest, amazing sales leader, worked with you at Stripe. She said something along these lines, but a little different. Jeanne is probably the best go-to-market person at connecting with product and engineering, deeply understanding the product and providing the most valuable input to her counterparts of any I've ever seen. It sounds like just another ingredient here is just sales feeling like a real partner to product engineering actually, not just being like, "Hey, do these things for me, but actually feeling like a partner."

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:13:01):
Ultimately company strategy is basically product strategy meets go-to market strategy. And so I spend guess as a go-to market leader, I'm constantly trying to figure out how do I make more money more efficiently? And you typically do that by having a winning product in the market that is well commercialized. And so that means that I really lean into thinking about product strategy and thinking about pricing strategy because if those two things are optimal, you're going to win more often and there'll be less friction in it. And so that's sort of where got to put as a revenue leader, like a GM hat on and not just think, how do I sell? But actually how do I enable the insights I'm getting from talking to customers constantly to have the company strategy be more effective?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:00):
Speaking of product, going in a slightly different direction, PLG product-led growth, it felt like it was very hot for a while where everyone's like, "You got to go PLG, that's the only way to win. It's impossible to do sales. The future is PLG." It feels like that's gone away. And in large part, obviously still companies grow through PLG and work through PLG. What's just kind of your thoughts on PLG and when does it make sense for a company these days to actually think this is how they'll grow for a while?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:14:28):
PLG makes sense for a lot of companies at the outset, unless you are very explicitly building a product for enterprise. So Sierra as an example, right? They are very clearly going after Global 2000 or something close to that. PLG is not going to be overly useful to them because they are trying to win eight-figure deals from day one. But for a lot of products, folks are targeting a startup audience at the outset and then they're adding more functionality so that they can ultimately continue to scale up market. So I think PLG is still super relevant. It's a major driver of Vercels growth. It was a big driver of Stripe's growth. The thing that folks get wrong is it does typically have a ceiling. So people are generally not going to give you $1 million via self-serve flow. So at some point if you want to sustain growth rates, you're going to have to have your deal sizes get bigger and bigger. And where I think folks get stuck is waiting too long on PLG because it does take a while to build a replicable sales process and a sales process, which often you're getting fed by inbound at the beginning and then you got to add outbound. It takes a while actually to turn outbound into a predictable engine. So I think where you see companies hit walls is just when they don't add the sales portion of it soon enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:00):
So essentially every company ends up having to build a sales org, some start product-led and then at sales, some just start sales and have it from the beginning.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:16:09):
Yeah, I would agree. There are probably some good examples of large vertical SaaS platforms that are SMB, but even they wind up with Velocity sales team. So yeah, I don't know that I can think of a 100 billion company that's PLG-only.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):
Yeah, it just feels like you're leaving money on the table even if you are growing really fast. I know Atlassian was a long-time PLG company but eventually succumbed. I don't know if that's the right way to put it. Okay. You mentioned pricing. I know you have strong opinions on pricing and pricing strategy. What's just a couple of tips you might share with someone thinking about how to price their product?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:16:52):
Yeah, this is kind of on the theme, but I think the first thing is you got to think about pricing like a product. So it's another one where it actually really matters how you choose to price a product. Do you really understand where customers are going to drive value? Do you really understand where you incur costs? And are you doing a smart job of aligning those things? You've got lots of examples of companies grossly underpricing, you're sort of afraid to charge for the value that you actually provide. I think there are a lot of examples where people default to including a freemium strategy without that actually being a strategy. A good example at Stripe, we launched Stripe Billings years ago. It had a freemium strategy because that's what you do. And then we sort of looked at it and we're like, "actually integrating straight billing takes a little bit of work.So if you do that, you're probably going to stay."

(01:17:56):
And so we killed that, killed the free trial to zero downside. So that's another one. At Vercel, we've been going through that transition where we're a consumption-based business model ultimately, but at the outset we basically kind of bundled that into what looked like a SaaS-like price and as we've added a lot more functionality that wasn't working anymore. And so we did an unbundling and right now actually we did a pretty substantial pricing change in August where we have an enterprise at a pro-skew. And if you looked at the enterprise skew, it's called Enterprise for a reason, enter, it's meant to be sold to an enterprise. And actually about half of the folks on the enterprise skew were startups, which suggests that there's stuff in the enterprise skew that a startup really wants. So we kicked a lot of that stuff out of the enterprise skew and made it so you could buy it self-serve online and what do you know, people are.

(01:19:03):
So now that's really driven a lot of growth in our PLG funnel, which is awesome for startups because it's super efficient. They can just buy things, they want that. It's awesome for us because you don't have to have a human intermediate that. So getting all of these knobs really tuned is a key to both a great customer experience and optimal revenue outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:24):
Maybe just one more question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. It's going to be a combo question. I hear you have a hot take on sales comp, how to comp salespeople that's different from other people and also who to hire when you're hiring folks in sales. Can you just talk about your takes there?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:19:41):
I struggle with sales comp because it's all about pay for performance, which I'm obviously a fan of, but it makes your organization less flexible because you basically have to decide 12 months in advance, these are things I value and particularly in this moment that could be different. As a great example of this, when we wrote the sales plans for this year at Vercel, the AI cloud did not exist. We were selling our front-end cloud and we were selling VZero and introduced the AI cloud halfway through the year. Now we had all sorts of good ways to still incentivize that, but I think you want to be able to be innovative and pivot and when you have a well-designed sales plan or a very structured sales plan, that can be challenging.

(01:20:44):
So that's a little bit of my hot take is just I'm trying to figure out how do you have the upside of sales of motivates people. It's a quantitative function, which is great, but also the flexibility to change your mind because I think a lot of companies right now are having a hard time doing annual planning. So that's one. On profiles, I have always valued just sort of a diversified portfolio. So I strongly believe that sales is a skill and so you want salespeople with actual sales experience in your organization, but I think there's value in pairing them with more nontraditional backgrounds, in particular consulting or banking background. Those folks are really good at more quantitative and analytical aspects of sales. So getting into that consultative part, which I think we talked about at the outset. And so I find that when you mix these together, the sort of consultant banker profile realizes, "Oh wait a minute, sales is a skill and I didn't really have it." And so they go learn from your account executives with that background and then your AEs learn more about, okay, how do I think about a P&L? How can I talk to a CFO? How do I present a TCO analysis more effectively? And so just creates a much richer learning environment where people are bouncing ideas off each other.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:22):
That is awesome. I love that strategy. Okay, final question. Just is there anything else you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:31):
Oh man. I feel like we've been very thorough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:34):
All right, thanks So too.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:35):
Yeah, you stumped me on that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:38):
Okay. That's the goal. With that Jean, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to make it very quick. I know you got to run. I'm going to ask you just two questions.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:46):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):
One is I'm going to skip to your life motto. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in worker and life?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:54):
I do. I actually have found that I'm known for saying a handful of things that I didn't necessarily realize it, but when you leave an organization, people tend to tell you what stuck with them. But there is one that I think I am known for saying growing up, my mom always said to me, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. And in sales, you're always going to have a quarter when you're not on pace. And so that's one that I feel like I pull on, not infrequently because in my view, there's another version of this, my mom also always says was where there's a will, there's a way. So I think you can always choose to find a path forward even when that's not super clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:45):
I love these. Okay, last question. I read that you were a very competitive diver in college early on. I'm just curious if there's something you learned from that experience that brought with you that helps you be as successful as you've become?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:23:59):
Well, I mean, first of all, I should say I was generally coming in third place out of three on my team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:04):
Third place, that's not bad.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:24:07):
I managed to do it in college, but that was the extent of that career. So diving is a precision sport and it is a repetitive sport. And it is also a sport where when you land flat on your back, and literally as you are swimming to the side of the pool, welts are forming on it, you always 100% of the time will be forced to immediately get back on the diving board and do that exact same dive again. And so I think that has a lot of stuff that's transferable to work and to sales. So for me, I just have an obsession with excellence and within sales. sales is about replicability. How do you drive predictable outcomes, how excellent are you at your ability to forecast? And so I think I bring that to bear within sales a lot. And then similarly, you get a lot of nos in sales. So another phrase that a sales guru said to me once or in a training was yeses are great, nos are great, maybes will kill you. And so how do you get really comfortable that no is a great thing and that just gave you data and now you can go do something with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:25):
This is a really inspiring and empowering way to end the conversation. Jean, thank you so much for being here.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:25:33):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. It was a lot of fun.

# Building product at Stripe: craft, metrics, and customer obsession | Jeff Weinstein (Product lead)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Watching you operate on Twitter, you're just breaking this wall between the PM and the customer.

Jeff Weinstein (00:00:04):
The moment the customer felt compelled enough to go out of their way to talk about some problem, that's a unbelievable gift. I will leave a meeting to just get one message back to them. If you're text message friendly with five or 10 of those, you are going to have so much direct signal that is infectious.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
Many people told me I need to ask you about picking metrics.

Jeff Weinstein (00:00:24):
Well, what was the value that we're trying to produce for the customer and can we measure it from their perspective? And okay, how do you know you have product market fit? Charts that showcase things are going up into the right on one hand and then tweets on the other.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
You started at Stripe something called study groups.

Jeff Weinstein (00:00:39):
We show up four to eight people total pretend to be some company with some outcome problem. Rule one is you do not work at Stripe and rule two is we're not here to solve any problems. This is just about practicing empathy for the customer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Jeff Weinstein. Over the course of his six plus years at Stripe, Jeff was the product lead for Stripe's payment infrastructure teams. We helped scale Stripe payments to hundreds of billions of dollars in volume a year. He also led PMs and Teams on a number of zero to one bets at Stripe, and most recently took on the scaling of Stripe Atlas, which as of the day this podcast launches allows you to incorporate a new company in a single day, including handling 83B elections, incorporation documents, getting your EIN, share purchases, and all the things that used to take weeks or months before a company could begin operating. At this point, one in six new Delaware corporations are started on Stripe Atlas, which blows my mind. This episode ended up being the longest in my podcast history because I wanted to basically do an archeology of an incredibly effective and admired product leader.

(00:01:49):
We spent the entire conversation digging deep into the many skills that Jeff has built that enable him to consistently build successful and beloved products. We get into his go-go- go plus optimism, long-term compounding philosophy of building products, how to think about and operationalize product craft and quality. He shares a popular program that he started at Stripe called Stripe Study Groups that I think you should steal. We also talk about how to effectively talk to customers, how to know if you have product market fit for your new product, how to pick great metrics for your team, what he's learned about getting shit done at a big company. Also, advice that he's gotten from the founders of Stripe and so much more. This episode is for anyone who's looking to level up their product building chops in every way.

Jeff Weinstein (00:02:50):
Thank you Lenny of Lenny's Podcast. I knew what to expect, but it's fun to see the first name and the podcast all line up. I really appreciate you asking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:59):
So I wanted to start with a quote that I found from you that I think gives a little perspective into how you think and how you approach the world. So here's the quote. "Very frequently I would do poorly on tests in school and then the professor would say very reasonably, 'Hey, I think you should bump down a level to the previous semester's pace,'" and you said, "I actually know that, that's why I'm in this class. I want to be in the class that I'm potentially the worst at." This isn't how most people think. This isn't how most people operate. Usually people want to get good grades, they want to be at the top of their class. Clearly you have a different approach and a different mindset. Where did this come from for you and how did this shape the way you think about product and the work that you do?

Jeff Weinstein (00:03:37):
Some of it was just the fact that I wasn't particularly good at the class and had to rationalize it for myself in some form. So in retrospect that sounds highfalutin, but at the time I just wasn't particularly good at the classes I was in. But I think it comes from growing up. I went to a pretty hippy-dippy K through 12 school in Baltimore, Maryland where we were really asked to think about why we were in school and to pick any of the courses that were of interest to us outside of AP programs or grades or any particular requirements. You really got to choose your own path. And I recall one particular class in high school, which was somewhat a science class, but it was called the History of Science, and we actually walked through and studied all of the, at the time, best understood ways the world worked in science, but then later were turned out to be wrong, right?

(00:04:40):
In the 1500s we believed X, Y, and Z. In the 1600s we believed A, B and C. just very confidently. In 1500s we thought something and then the 1600s we thought something very different. And so this class was quite impactful on me where we spent an entire year studying things that are not true. It was fascinating. That particular teacher employed another trick on us during that class, which was it took the tuition fee of our school and divided it by the number of hours and wrote the cost on a ticket and then handed us in the beginning of the year. Tickets for every single one of the classes and he would stand at the door and you would have to give him a ticket at the end of the class that he thought it was worth it. And just like that practice of deep intellectual understanding of how people evaluated something at the time and choosing for yourself to spend the time on it by just the physical act of handing that ticket to the teacher.

(00:05:44):
That really clicked for me. And so when I got to college and it was a real college university, people are coming from often quite more rigorous backgrounds of things that were true. I was a bit unprepared and I remember actually taking a microeconomics class that was quite advanced and had a close friend and we studied exactly the same information. We sat and looked at the same cheat sheets, we practiced the same quizzes, we read the same books, and he got the top grade in the class and I got the bottom and that's from where that quote came from where the professor said, I think you should bump, potentially bump down. I was like, "I already know that stuff. I'm interested in this topic. I'm going to try to improve, but look just because I'm significantly worse than the other kids in the class that has little to do with if I should leave." And he was particularly cool with it.

(00:09:07):
It's really interesting that you went to this liberal artsy hippy dippy school as you described, which a lot of people bash on. Why spend all this college money and time on a liberal artsy education and you ended up being really successful in a very technical, highly analytical data-driven company, and it's interesting that that experience still helped you succeed in this other path.

Jeff Weinstein (00:09:27):
It did take a change though because I started in... English was my selected major in school, but then I kept playing with computers and I kept liking math and I looked at the roles of the backgrounds of the people who were running the types of companies I loved. At the time Facebook was getting super phenomenally successful. Apple was already on their up and up again and everyone who was leading those places had technical backgrounds and I liked computers a lot, so I added computer science as an engineering degree midway through school. So I had to take the real science classes with the pre-med kids and the rest of it, and I did similarly poorly, but I did end up with a computer science degree and a liberal arts degree. So it was a journey, but I had to make a pretty big switch in the middle to get on that path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:16):
I asked you if there was one thing that you'd love to get across in this podcast. I asked you what would it be and here's what you said. Here's the first item on this list that you sent me, "Go, go, go ASAP plus optimistic comma, long-term compounding approach." Can you just talk about what you mean by that?

Jeff Weinstein (00:10:36):
Yeah, there's two things going on here. So I see the world as immediately we have just such opportunity to take action in front of us. We can be optimistic and go, go, go as soon as possible. I think that a lot of life is you get as much furniture as you've room in the house. We will do the work the night before it's due, so let's just make it due tomorrow. Can we turn tomorrow into today? So just optimistically seeing if we can just inject energy to go, go, go has produced surprising results and I think it ignites in other people that same interest and then it feeds off each other. And that's I think really in my bones from growing up. And then I added over time, had to learn this longer term, compounding, more strategic mindset where some of the things we want to accomplish, be it at my startups in the past or at Stripe, they can't be solved in an afternoon.

(00:11:41):
They're going to require layers of infrastructure and services and applications and UI and partnerships that really look like that iceberg drawing you see where you just see the top, but then there's the whole thing underneath and I've had to learn over time to pair my instinct of like, "Let's get it done today, let's move forward, let's see what we can get done. Let's make some mistakes, let's try it out." With, "Where are we going? What needs to be true over time? Where can we always invest? What will we never regret spending time in?" We'll never regret spending time making the latency of our payments APIs at Stripe faster. We'll never regret making it more reliable to send 83B election mails to the IRS. Like we'll never regret those things. So let's just always compound those capabilities over time. Then the trick is how do you mix this go, go, go attitude with a long-term compounding? That's something I still struggle with, but I try to purposely balance it more than I used to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:44):
It's such a good way of summarizing just how to be successful in a lot of things. Go, go, go ASAP, stay optimistic. Focus on long-term compounding growth. Is there an example of that in action? I know we're going to talk about Atlas a bunch, but I guess is there an example of that working for you or a product you worked on?

Jeff Weinstein (00:13:03):
I work at Stripe, which is a infrastructure company. We build things that help businesses do online commerce in various forms, and I've had a few roles at Stripe. I'm in our beautiful office here in South San Francisco, one of which was the product person that helped us decide how we were going to go global and how we were going to offer multiple ways for people to pay. It turns out there's more than just credit cards in the world. There's small hundreds of ways that people will naturally want to pay for things online and as a business you're going to, of course, just want to accept whatever it is people want to pay with. And for the first seven or eight years of Stripe, well prior to my being here, the incremental country ads and the incremental new payment methods was relatively flat over time and that was surprising to all of us who worked here because the world wanted it and we had a lot of people working on it and we were working very hard, but it wasn't producing returns in the way that we wanted.

(00:14:11):
And so actually the optimistic as soon as possible go-go attitude was not working. No matter how much energy we poured into building Thailand payment methods or UK bank transfers or an in-person payment system in Latin America, we just couldn't rack up points and get it done. So we had to step back and say, "Well, what is the world going to look like in 10 years? What was going to need to be true and how can we start to go there now?" Which meant going a lot slower, building internal platforms, sending people around the world to start to build these payment methods, uproot their lives, pay for their apartments, get them on airplanes, start using these payment methods actually in the world. And so it really our line flat line for a while and we're like, "Okay, is this strategy working? Is it not working?" But then over time we start to see it switch to nonlinear again and go from whatever it was, 10 payment methods at the time.

(00:15:03):
And now Stripe accepts over 100. So we got to 50 really quickly and then skyrocketed to 100. And I remember there being a meeting where we said, "Well, maybe we should just lock everyone in the basement and see if we can get from 10 to 50." That would be the intensity startup go attitude. But we looked at the individual components of what it meant to get this done and how long we wanted this to be true for and we had to go a lot slower. That was a very formative decision where you had to mix the go, go, go with the long-term compounding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:39):
Awesome. Okay, so let's start to delve deeper into some of the specific seals that I hear you're incredible at and that I've seen you be incredible at on Twitter and LinkedIn and things like that. So the first is craft, craft and quality. I'm told by many people that you have a very strong obsession with craft and user experience and quality and even more so I'm told that you teach people at Stripe how to be obsessed with craft and quality and user experience in a very systematic way. I feel like this is something a lot of people are starting to realize is really important and or are trying to get better at, either personally or at their company. So first of all, let me just ask why is this so important to you? Why do you think craft and experience and quality is so important? Why do you put so much emphasis on it yourself?

Jeff Weinstein (00:16:25):
I think I'm really working backwards from failures in the past and avoiding them. And so maybe just a quick story. I started a company several years ago based on just a personal pet peeve of mine, which was I was a SQL analyst. Many you listening might have written SQL in the past, maybe the robots write the SQL for you now, but you still need to write SQL yourself. And every single time I wrote a SQL query, I wanted to run the same subsequent analysis. I wanted great version control, I wanted all the cool stuff that GitHub had for code but for writing data code. And so my friends and I built a little Python tool which basically let you run our style queries. It lets you draw charts and pivot tables quickly and sharing all this modern SaaS application stuff. But applied to SQL a few years ago and we turned that into a company.

(00:17:29):
We got some progress, but then there was this moment one day where we had maybe a couple 100 customers and we had an error where we basically by accidentally shut down the service and it was bricked for 10 or 20 minutes. And at the time we were hustling in our little dinky office to get the application back online. And we really were proud of ourselves about how reasonably quickly we did and people went back to using it. It wasn't a super long outage and we didn't lose any data. We were just high-fiving each other. And we went about our day and about a year later I realized that that was a...

(00:18:11):
I missed a huge moment that I should have pounced on, which is that during those 20 minutes, our customers weren't furious. They weren't emailing us like crazy, they weren't texting us, they weren't trying to find us on Google Maps and knock on our door and say, "Hey, I need this thing back online immediately." We heard a couple comments from them, it was little murmurs. And I didn't realize at the time that was the signal that we did not have product market fit. And I ended up wasting many more years on that project. And wasting is a big word. We built amazing software, people liked it, we were able to sell the company.

(00:18:55):
It helped many of us learn how to really build software. But I'm really trying to avoid that situation again. And I think craft is a dessert that you get after the meal of does your thing solve a real problem in the world and are people clamoring, needing it badly? And that's really my obsession is in finding problems in which people will pause their entire day to solve. They will leap through the computer to be like, "Oh my God, I have that problem. Do you have a solution?"

(00:19:32):
And if you focus on that style of product development and we can get into just how do you listen for that and then turn that into product. Later, you might get the opportunity to really provide craft and beauty and touches and moments and delight. But certainly there is no amount of craft, there is no amount of beauty, there's no amount delight or touches you can add to a thing that will solve the problem we had at our startup, which is that people didn't really need this. And that's the biggest error is picking something in which people don't really need it. And then going through these practices of trying to make it great when maybe it shouldn't exist in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
I think a lot of people see all these tweets and messages about just obsessed with the craft of what you're building and you can easily lose sight of... Nobody even cares about what you're building. It could be the most incredible experience ever designed, but if it's not something anyone ever wants, it doesn't really matter.

Jeff Weinstein (00:20:34):
People don't really get out of bed for their second problem. They get out of bed for their first problem. And you have to carefully listen and not pitch your customer or your prospective customer as you're trying to figure this out. And I think this advice, not even advice just style applies to small companies, big companies, anyone which is people don't want to be pitched. I'm sometimes on a UXR call with a very well-meaning person or a founder who has a new product that they want advice on or they want to find customers. And the first thing that they start talking about when we get on the call is, "Hi, I'm the CEO of X, Y, and Z company. We do one, two, and three. I want to show you a demo." It's like, "Hold up, I'm a customer. I have..." What a wasted opportunity you've just done here.

(00:21:34):
I have so many problems, you're guessing ahead of time, what is my top problem and now that you've anchored and limited to the pitch you're going to miss, you very likely going to miss the burning problem that they have on the top of their mind. And it's not the customer's job to interrupt you and say, "Hey, could you stop your pitch? I want to tell you about my top problem." And you can see this down the stream, which then companies who launch things, put craft, have a great launch, raise money are then later gone. And it's because they built something that wasn't solving a burning need. And I think you can stem it all the way back to they were just pitching rather than sitting in silence and just waiting for their customer to just open their heart out about what's the most burning thing.

(00:22:28):
And sometimes I'll prompt our customers, I'll say, "Hey, do you mind just opening up your email? What's in there?" Or, "If you weren't talking to me right now, what would you be working on?" Or, "Hey, last week, what grinds your gears? What are you not looking forward to?" Or magic wand, "What do you wish you could just have off your plate immediately? Forget Stripe, forget about thing, work on just in your whole life. What is it that you do not want to be doing?" Or, "A massive opportunity you wish was just one door away?" And it's a little awkward because they don't know why you're asking that kind of question, but then you just sit there in silence. And for the most part, if you have amazing customers who are smart and ambitious and are trying to build their own business, they're going to want to offload their hardest thing to somebody else.

(00:23:17):
If you've earned trust along the way, and certainly not pitching is a great way of earning trust. You're just listening. We've learned a lot at Stripe from that. And that's where you can start to find adjacencies, right? "Well, hey, I don't know if Stripe could really help me with this, but wouldn't it be cool if we could identify if the person signing up on our site wasn't fraudulent or is who they say they are or isn't a bot, or are they really a dog on the internet?" And we're like, "We keep this as the major complaint from all of our customers, but we're not an identity company." It's like, "Well, I guess now we are because all of our customers who are trying to build their business all have this problem." And so via silence, you can just create your roadmap pretty quickly and drop a lot of the long UXR, long survey, long build cycle approach.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:15):
So I love where we're going with this. This is where I was going to actually talk about next is just your ability to talk to customers and user research. It feels very unique, watching you operate on Twitter, you're just sharing your email constantly, getting on calls with people constantly. There's this, you're breaking this wall between... That a lot of people imagine there is between the PM and the lead of a team and the customer. You're not relying easy research. You're not waiting for someone else to do this work for you. Talk about just why and how you do this. I think there's so much to learn from just how you operate in finding opportunities, picking problems to solve by talking to customers.

Jeff Weinstein (00:24:53):
It's where the business comes from is customers. It is not a long shot hypothesis about why to talk to them. It's like if they love your stuff, they will tell their friends and pay fair prices for the product. We're so fortunate through the internet that people announced themselves as being interested in a topic. Sometimes they're interested in it by posting on Reddit a long thread or a screenshot of a customer service interaction that bugged them or hopeful that from their dorm room in country X, someone else in the world has solved the same problem. And the internet has given us all this absolutely magical forum that you can just yell out the window and then billions of people could actually listen to what you said out the window. Now, that's not all the time true for all people in all situations, but dramatically more true now than ever before in human history.

(00:26:05):
And so the fact that people wouldn't be listening to their customers and really jumping through the computer to talk to them surprises me. It's like I always sometimes think, "Do they have some other strategy? Are they so confident in what they're building that they don't need to hear directly from the people who will be using it?" And I think some of it is my own fear that I'm going to make the same mistake I've made in the past, which is build something that people like they're using but isn't solving a burning enough problem such that they're going to stop their day, they're going to tell their friends, we're going to be able to sustain the company economically over a long period of time. And that really just comes from hearing people's most burning problems and then just jumping through the computer and talking to them takes a little bit of nervous gumption, like walking up to a person at a bar or cocktail party and saying, "Hi, my name is Jeff."

(00:27:08):
It can be a little awkward, but then you get it. It's a rush once it starts to work. And once you get the iterative loop that they're excited to talk to you, they have problems, they see you as a trusted, not salesy, not pitching, not narrow-minded to just my product and my position, but I'm here to hear about all of your problems and see where we can help. Not promising we can help solve everything, but let's listen. That is infectious, both between the customers and internally. And so I'm able to bring more people into that practice. At Stripe, I'm able to quickly grab an engineer and hop on a call. I can forward a message over to a Slack group. And they know that because the customer's speaking directly, it somewhat trumps everything that's happening during the day. We could go to our meeting where we're going to guess what the customer wants or we could talk to them directly.

(00:28:08):
And you have to use a little bit of art to decide which customers you want to listen the closest to. But even at Stripe's scale, where we're dealing with many millions of businesses and many hundreds of millions of consumers on the other end of those businesses, you can pattern match relatively quickly. What are the styles of customers that represent where the world is going, the most ambitious, the most technical, the fastest growing, the most detailed. And you don't need 10,000 of those people to talk to. If you're text message friendly with five or 10 of those, you are going to have so much direct signal about where to go that you forget how you did it in the past.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:57):
I love these. So I'd love to learn more about these tactics that you've found helpful. So you've shared this idea of silence, talking to someone and just being silent, and I forget the phrase you used, but just like ideas emerge, like your whole road map can emerge from that silence. So let me share a few of the things you shared so far and I'm curious what else. Two is tweeting just like, "Hey, I'm looking to improve Atlas right now. What bugs do you have? Here's my email address." You talked about text messaging, just like, "Hey, can I get your number? And I'll just text you when I have questions." If there's anything else to add to these, that'd be awesome. And then what else have you found? Just ways to actually get to a customer and find opportunities that are important.

Jeff Weinstein (00:29:34):
Speed is an important one, which is just reducing the time between the moment the customer felt compelled enough to go out of their way to talk about some problem. They're busy, there are snacks to eat, they have families, they have other things to do. There's a lot going on in the world, a lot. Your dumb product, it's amazing that they would spend any of their time discussing it at all. I mean, most of the time if you don't like something, you just move along. You just apathetically, silently move forward in the world. And so the fact that someone took their finite time to succinctly with curiosity, communicate to the world or you about your product, that's a unbelievable gift.

(00:30:27):
That should be P-zero alert level intensity. And so I will leave a meeting, I will change what I'm doing to just get one message back to them. Even if it's, "Hey, I got this. I'm about to go to dinner. Can I hit you up tomorrow?" They're like, "Oh yeah, thank you. Awesome. I can't even believe you responded." That puts us in the camp of on the right trajectory where they're going to feel that they have a almost secret portal between this big brand of a company and another human who's just actually curious...

Jeff Weinstein (00:31:03):
... brand of a company and another human who's just actually curious what's going on, that's night and day. And it's also, fun fact, tip, when people are really hot on an issue and it could blow up on social or they're going to start becoming a detractor, we make mistakes, we have SLA breaches, we have errors, you're going to want to get on that stuff fast. And in those situations, my bar for how we will respond to those folks is not to just solve the problem, but it is to turn them into a promoter, and most of the time we're able to, even if there was a pretty relevant issue.

(00:31:40):
I remember one time at Atlas, we had this bug in which for a handful of our legal docs, they were handing out let's say, 25 shares rather than 25% of the shares. We dropped the percentage sign, and thankfully a founder noticed this in the docs and tweeted about it. My heart paused and I was like, "Oh no, this could be a really serious issue." And we were able to fix it and regenerate the documents relatively quickly for everyone that was impacted. And I was thinking to myself, "Wow, we really let this person down. We have one job to do, which is to get their company right and we didn't."

(00:32:20):
And that person was incredibly gracious about the situation and said, "Anytime you want me to just read your docs, I'd be happy to. I have a law degree. I care about this topic. I want to brainstorm with you about ways that Atlas could do more document creations." I was like, "Wow, I can't believe I was in this sort of defense position, and now we've gained a friend in the world who can be eyes and ears and brainstorm with us." And the team maintains a really close relationship with that person as they do with many, many founders who use Atlas.

(00:32:53):
And so, just again, we're so quick to put the outside world in this other camp where we need to touch it with kid gloves and treat it as a big blob and a cohort and a statistic, when it is a human with a problem who likes snacks, who is busy, and it's fun to do and it turns out to be an incredibly easy, fast way to figure out what to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:20):
There's a bunch of stuff I want to follow up here. One is, people may be hearing this and like, "Oh my God, I'd be overwhelmed with feedback and people to fix problems for and bugs and texting of people." They're just like, "There's so many people that potentially I'd have to be interacting with." How do you try to narrow that down? I know Atlas is a very highly adopted product. There's a ton of people, there's probably bugs, often people sending you feedback. How do you pick the people to zero in on?

Jeff Weinstein (00:33:47):
I think there are two parts to this. One, what a problem to have. Of all the problems in the world, "I'm overwhelmed by customer interest," is on the top list of problems I want to have. I think most entrepreneurs would purchase that problem as a state. And so, if you're in it, I think, take a deep breath and look at the sunrise or sunset and just enjoy the fact that you've built something that is meaningful enough that people would spend their time. Again, there are amazing snacks that they could be spending the time on otherwise, so that's a huge deal. And then two, you need the art. There's an art and science to picking where to go deep. I will happily respond to folks with, "I really appreciate that. Do you mind sending me a screenshot or a video?" And some of them don't. Okay, that's fine.

(00:34:45):
You kind of get a sense of quickly looking at how they wrote about it or just pattern matching how detailed they were, or how much they seem that they want to engage and kind of balance it that way. Otherwise, you can tell folks, "This is really awesome. Do you mind sending me an email with three to five bullet points about the details of how you got to this issue?" And that's not a 30-minute meeting. You don't need to blow up your whole life to get on the phone with them. It's not a huge homework assignment to them, but it's enough structure that it will self-select those who want to go deep, and then from there, you really do owe it to them to follow up if they're going to be that detailed. And at that point, you really have made a product friend for life and you'll kind of continuously go back to them. So you have to kind of tune it.

(00:35:48):
I also will bound some of these efforts, so I'll just completely make up one day a program. So, "Hi, Stripe's doing a bug-finder program." I made that up as I was driving to work one morning, tweeted it, was curious if anyone would send anything. "We'll be taking videos for the next three days to go super deep." And people are like, "Oh my goodness, I would love to be part of the Stripe bug-finder program. May I apply?" I'm like, "Oh, it's very selective. But yes, of course for you." It's just giving people permission through a program, even if it is deeply arbitrary, I find helps with bounding it, and then later I can follow up with the world, "Hey, we ran our first program, we got 65 videos," which we did. "We found dozens of issues," which we did. It was an incredibly valuable use of our time and it really came from just a single tweet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:53):
Something I saw you mention somewhere is that you only pay attention to feedback from people that are paying customers and ignore everything else. Can you talk about that?

Jeff Weinstein (00:37:00):
People who build things for people tend to be empathetic and interested and curious folks who have friends, and then those friends want to use your stuff because they know you and they like you and they'll have good feedback. But you need to figure out, is that actually your customer, or is that your friend trying it? Who is actually your target customer exactly? Not a company or a segment, not digital natives that are X big. I'm talking about Sarah in this department, who has these tabs open and just faced this problem and needs to solve it by 4:00 PM. That level of specificity. If that's your customer, and I'm talking mostly about B2B, which is where I spend a lot of my time as the social network, B2C stuff I have less intuition on, they're very willing to exchange money for solving their problems, incredibly so. Oftentimes, if you listen with enough silence, they might even say, "I'll pay you money to solve, blah." If you sit there long enough in silence.

(00:38:17):
And so, you could listen to your friendly friend who you got to play with your beta version and they'll say they liked it and they will click around. But that is extremely different from Sarah, who has the actual problem and is willing to pay. And it is so tempting to go down the first path with the friend group that I sort of needed a rule, which was like, "Okay, rather than..." I was like, "Well, don't pay attention to that quite as much. Really pay attention to, who is your target customer and are you in a fast iteration cycle for them and are they telling their friends?"

(00:38:51):
But that wasn't enough, because people are so drawn, myself included, drawn to the friendliness that I just set a rule, which is, "We discount all of that feedback from our friends to zero." That is not of interest to us. We don't even write it down. It's just not part of what we're talking about at all. We are only interested in Sarah, our target customer, and can we get her to solve whatever the problem is as quickly as possible, as jangly as possible and go from there?

(00:39:26):
And then the paying part is a forcing function because again, even with Sarah, because you're paying attention to her and solving her problem a bit, she'll say, "Of course, oh, this is great. I want feature X, Y and Z. Can it do one, two, and three?" Naturally, she would say that. But if you said, "And by the way, this thing is $10,000. We'll happily refund your money 100% the second you don't like it," she might say, "Whoa, whoa, wait a second. Yeah, I like this thing, but not $10, 000. For $10,000, it would need to solve X." And you're like, "Oh, there it is." That was actually what the thing that was of value, and we were all kind of dancing around this. It's useful, we're on the right track, and because I've fallen down that path myself so many times, I just set a rule.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:25):
This is great. I was actually going to ask. This technique of using silence, to help people actually practice it, you just shared this quote of, "For you to pay $10,000 it would've to do X." That's a really cool line to use. Is there any other advice there of just how to practice this idea of creating silence to help a potential customer share what they actually need?

Jeff Weinstein (00:40:45):
I encourage people to take an improv training class or two, just to get people out of their skin a bit. By the way, this advice applies to big companies also, not just small ones. And we have issues, and I hear other larger companies have issues where a big company will say, "Hey, we're an enterprise and we're going to pay you this big contract. All you need to do is build features one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and go through security steps, A, B, C, D, E, F, G." And this siren song of the big three-year contract of your first enterprise buyer, even when you're already big, you can go from Fortune 1000 to Fortune 500 to Fortune 10 to Fortune 1. There's always more. There are so many stories of the rug being pulled in the middle and they never actually use it and the contract never lands.

(00:41:38):
Same in partnerships. And so, I would say the same thing, which is, "If we're super serious about this, send us $1 million. Wire us $1 million. We'll happily wire it back anytime you need it, but let's actually put some stake in the ground about the value." And I find that in the cases in which they're like, "Whoa, wait a second, no, absolutely not. We can't commit here." That's really a good signal because you're about to spend a huge amount of time building something that might not ever be used, and that's the majority case I hear. Or you might get the opposite, which is, "Sounds great. Let's make sure our teams are trained on it faster. How can we get you to our office to explain it? We need it to really work with this system we haven't talked about yet. And now that we're paying, we want it even faster."

(00:42:32):
And so, I find that it puts a fork in the road towards faster success or avoiding the non-success case. And even at Stripe scale, I've heard our founders somewhat push this methodology on us, where one from the outside might think, "Well, it's a 8,000 person company. Surely they have just regular ways of building things for larger customers, and we too need these style of commitments if we're going to go off roadmap."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
So a big lesson you're sharing here is essentially, make sure people are ready to pay for something that they're asking for. That is the ultimate sign that they-

Jeff Weinstein (00:43:13):
And by the way, ready to pay is different than paying. Significantly different, significantly different. I've also thought of, "Well, as long as they're ready to pay and they said they would pay and they look at the contract, we should feel good." That is not the same as paying. Paying is an independent group of people saying, "My problem is burning enough that I'm willing to exchange something I have that has value for the promise of what you're going to do." And now it's a real commitment. That is extremely different than ready to. So I will often be on the phone or video, whatever with a founder and I will have them practice charging me. I'll just say, "Hey, I'm just a friend. I'm trying to help you out. It's a little bit self-serving because I work at Stripe and I want to get feedback on our products."

(00:44:09):
I'll say, "Feel free to sign up for any invoicing or payment service. I don't really care which one. You're welcome to choose Stripe if it's easy enough for you, I'd love to hear your two cents, and send me an invoice or a payment link for $1 right now, right now. That way, when it comes time to actually charge your first customer, it won't be your first time. It won't feel weird. You'll have already done this, you already have a dollar in your account, you already have your logo on the top right of the invoice. It'll feel great." And I probably could go through my email inbox and just see $1 receipts to random people because I'm just so convinced that the difference between paying and willing, ready, I thought they would pay is night and day different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:57):
Yeah, there's this term, willingness to pay that I feel like it should change, as you're saying, to just cross that willingness to even just-

Jeff Weinstein (00:45:05):
Paying.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:06):
Paying, exactly.

Jeff Weinstein (00:45:07):
Yeah. And we can refund the money. There's no issue at all. Just other tricks on how to get people going is, ask them about their regular life as a human, "What did you do yesterday?" And they'll be like, "Oh, at work?" I'm like, "Or not. Whatever." And people, they'll start to spill, they'll just start to spill and eventually they'll get to their biggest problem pretty quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:33):
Let's talk about metrics, going in a different direction. Many people told me I need to ask you about picking metrics and the importance of metrics and how you think about metrics. So let me just maybe start with a question of, just why do you think picking the right metric and why are metrics so important in building successful products?

Jeff Weinstein (00:45:52):
I somewhat walk around with the belief that the product manager's responsibility is to produce product market fit. And okay, how do you know you have product market fit? Charts that showcase things are going up into the right on one hand, and then tweets on the other. So metrics like quantitative and qualitative, and I really see them as deep siblings and equals, you really need both. It's not oh, OKRs versus something. There are some things you want the texture of the person on video showing how complicated a thing was. And then also, we're trying to make an economically viable system that we can run at large scale and you can't keep all that stuff in your head and need to measure it. And so, I think metrics at their best are a numerical representation of the value we're providing for the customer.

(00:46:59):
One could measure anything. You can just start counting events and log lines. We've made it incredibly cheap to count stuff. And so, now we have this big privilege of choosing what to measure. And I really just try to map it all the way back to, "Well, what was actually the value that we're trying to produce for the customer and can we measure it from their perspective?" Whereas I think it's natural, both because when you work inside of a company, you're just thinking internally, but also the way that the metrics are collected inside your application to be more internal-oriented. How many people logged in? Okay, that's a fine measure, but how many people accomplished what they were trying to do after they logged in, is not just necessarily sitting there as a single event in your database. You have to think about it a bit. Another reason why I spend a lot of time crafting a small number of these metrics is, they force trade-offs and decisions.

(00:47:56):
So we could all sit around all day and say, "Hey, I heard all these customer problems, we should build X, Y, and Z." And another person could absolutely reasonably say, "Well, I heard from these customers, we should build one, two and three." And they're all true. We could have a lot of success in both, but the majority case is that we don't build either and we sit around and argue and bicker and we go slowly. "What are we going to do to naturally, organically every day, orient a larger group of people in the right direction and see if our tactics are generating progress over time for a customer from their perspective?" And metrics on the left and a series of tweets on the right is a pretty great combo.

(00:48:42):
Here's an example. A couple years ago I had been working in our payments group at Stripe for a bit, and then I started working on some of our banking and incorporation services. In Atlas, when I started working on it, it had had some success. It had already existed for four or five years prior to me spending time on it. But when I started to look at the support tickets, people were pretty unhappy frequently. They had a DocuSign stuck in their email box. They needed a co-founder's address, but they didn't know their co-founder's address. They couldn't log into the dashboard to figure out their 83(b) manual filing instructions. And we saw this basically in the first week of spending time on Atlas. I was just like, "Just show me all the support tickets. Are they happy support tickets? People writing in being like, 'Oh, I love this service, it's absolutely fantastic. Can you just do A, B, C more for me?' Or are they sad support tickets?" And they're like, "Oh my God, they're all sad support tickets."

(00:49:45):
And so, we're just asking ourselves, "Well, why would someone recommend Atlas to a friend?" I was like, "Well, it would have to accomplish A, B and C activities for them. It would have to get their company, it would have to handle getting their tax ID from the IRS. It'd have to handle all the downstream administrivia." But surely, if they had a bunch of support tickets at the end, they're not going to go tell their friends to use this thing. We could measure all of the intermediate parts, we could measure the success rate and the frequency of incorporation services and we do all those things, but if you looked at the support tickets, there's just no way if you had a support ticket, you would recommend it to a friend. And so, we suggested this metric to ourselves, companies that have no support tickets through the incorporation service.

(00:50:36):
The whole process, from the moment you start the application open, actually the first page load at the very beginning, all the way through the process waiting for the government, waiting for the IRS, and we give you two more weeks to write into support. We give an extra buffer two weeks. And if you get through that whole thing with no support tickets, that's a yes. If you have any number of support tickets, that's a no. And we just looked at the percentage of founders that were going through the service with zero support tickets, which is very different than looking at an average, right? You could have the average as 0.3, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're getting to 0.2 is going to cause them to tell their friends more. And we looked, and only 15% of founders were getting through Atlas with zero support tickets through that metric.

(00:51:31):
And I just thought, "Okay, well let's just drive that number way up, and let's look at the support tickets aside what people are needing and we'll bake it into the product, and presumably it'll fix it. People will like that more and then tell their friends." And over about 18 months, we took that number from 15% to 85. We basically just flipped it. And you can look at the market share plotted on the same timeframe and it's the same shape. And I think you have to find a measure by which it speaks directly to what the customer wanted, and that if you accidentally leaked your dashboard to them, your customer would be ecstatic to learn that that's what you were measuring the whole time. If we were to showcase the internal Atlas metrics, which we often just screenshot and publish, I think they'd be pretty happy to hear that we were spending all of our time making sure that none of them had support tickets.

(00:52:33):
And it was incredibly encouraging and motivating to the engineers on the team because we could just assign them a topic. "Hey, look at all these support tickets. Why don't you come up with the product spec, the scope, the solution? Oh, want to learn more? Just reply to the support ticket email, figure out what they need." And so, we kind of turned all of the engineers on the team into PMs to go and one issue at a time, figure out what needed to change and build products for it. And that's where we pushed forward on 83(b) elections, automating it, sending in the mail for folks. We built our own signing service.

(00:53:17):
We turned everything into a click. We did just did sort of the obvious things we saw in the tickets, but as the PM, I was able to just sort of, not on autopilot, but really sit back and have content full conversations with engineers who were bringing solutions and ideas for product, rather than one person going through all of the potential ideas, scoping them and assigning them. And because it was based in what people were saying and wanted, it was very motivating for everyone on the team. So somewhat long answer, but figuring out something in which every day we can wake up and look at the same metric and with some confidence know what to do, is so much better than, "Let's figure out what to do each month, and starting from scratch."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
I think this is amazing and important advice, just the power of a single metric that everyone on the team can understand, rally around and use to prioritize the work they're doing. I've seen exactly the same sort of impact. Funny enough, Airbnb, one of the teams actually had a metric sort of like this, basically reducing the people contacting Airbnb with support issues. But what ended up happening is, their team started just making it harder to contact support because they're like, "Maybe they don't need to contact support about all these trivial issues, so maybe let's encourage them to figure it out themselves." Is there anything you've learned about to try to avoid these kind of second order effects that are of perverse incentives of a metric?

Jeff Weinstein (00:54:47):
We look at multiple metrics, but we will optimize around one and you have to use your own judgment to look at some of these countermeasures and pick them. We would also, that would sort of be our overarching metric for a year, but then we would pick specific tactical metrics about how we would accomplish it. So just an example that both is how we solved a problem, but also it's just a style of metric that was useful to us. Of course, some of these support tickets included things like, "I'm waiting to hear back from Atlas about, if they're going to approve my application because Stripe is required for very good reasons to evaluate certain business types, or sanctions, lists and the worldwide products." So there is some, should be incredibly quick, but there is a bit of a review process, and of course if you were not hearing back from us, you would be upset because you're trying to make your company immediately, "This is ridiculous. Let's get back to us quickly."

(00:55:59):
And so, we knew that one of the reasons that people were writing to support was like, "Hey, what's up with my review? What's going on?" And we knew that our tactic was just to drive up how quickly we got to a final decision on folks and to reduce the number of overturned rejections, where someone writes back in saying, "Hi, come on, I'm totally just making something reasonable. What's up? Why did you reject me?" And so, we would pick these overarching single metric, which was the companies with zero support tickets, but then we would have a specific KR that was owned by an engineer, which is the tactic that we're going to do. And so, we would not allow ourselves the perverse tactics to sort of just casually exist. We would choose which tactics we're going to do and then set a metric for it.

(00:56:49):
And the other reason I love this metric is, it's a cohort metric by which you're trying to drive something up into the left. Sometimes people will get excited about a chart that goes up into the right, it's kind of a meme, "Oh, that's going up to the right." I'm really excited about charts that go up into the left. So you have to figure out some optimization that you're trying to maximize. And so, in this particular case of this risk review, we would look at, "Hey, for the cohort of customers that started last month, how quickly did we get them to their final risk review by number of days since they submitted?" And so, you want a chart that looks a lot like, "Here we go, right up to the top." Because you want 100% of your customers to get their final decision as quickly as possible.

(00:57:44):
Wouldn't you know it, when we looked at the chart, it was doing this. And so, each month we would just make it a little better, a little better, a little up and to the left, up and to the left, up and to the left. And now basically 100-ish percent of people get their risk review within an hour, from a long tail taking a long time. And so, we would constrain the tactic through a metric and then watch it through an optimization function. And then when we got to a point where we were happy with the target, we could put down the tactic. That's another really useful thing about metrics, you can decide when to stop a tactic because you get to some level of success that you're comfortable with and you can always choose to pick it back up later.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:23):
So there's some really cool lessons here of just how to pick a good metric. Just to kind of maybe summarize what I'm hearing is, you kind of worked backwards from essentially NPS, like, "Why aren't people recommending Atlas?" You found, "Okay, well people that are complaining and having issues with support and running into problems, most likely are going to be detractors, not going to want to recommend Atlas, so let's have those really ambitious goals. Eventually nobody has a support ticket/let's just track how many people have zero issues." And then you identify, "Okay, what's driving a lot of these support tickets? It looks like this risk timeline till they get to this certain milestone, let's make that our goal for the next quarter or whatever, and let's focus there and then make an impact." And then I imagine move on to other levers within this bucket of zero context.

Jeff Weinstein (00:59:08):
You have to pick the right metric for your audience in... I wouldn't wouldn't fully export that metric to everyone. That was not a terrible one to export, but in the founders choosing where to get started mindset, again, this isn't just deeply spending time listening to your customers. They all ask their friends, "Hey, how did you start your company?" They want to talk to an older sibling of sorts about how it went. And so, we decided that our go-to-market strategy would be to delight our current customers such that they would tell their friends. And other businesses, that's always somewhat useful, but you can also reach people with billboards and Google ads and other types of upsells. That's very difficult in the moment that someone is starting a company that's sort of a National Geographic, can you get the picture of the bird at exactly the right time?

(01:00:10):
How are you even supposed to go find people who are about to start companies? Thankfully, they have this practice of just asking their friends. And so, if their friends loved it, they're going to just recommend it. And that has the metric and the tactic and the go-to-market all lined up, rather than sometimes in cases you might hear someone say, "Well, let's make the product quality better." Well, we all make the product quality better, but why? Why is this actually going to move what our customers want, and the business board? And when you can line them all up, it can be quite beautiful, especially when you can see it month-over-month for a long period of time. One other metric I think that I would export to anybody, is if you are unsure what to measure, we have this, I don't know if we stole it from somebody else or if we came up with internally, whatever, is just users having a bad day, where we will just emit a log line anytime we think that a user bumped into a problem.

(01:01:14):
So maybe they hit a 404, or maybe their payout was one day after the ETA, or they had more than 10 payment declines, you can kind of brainstorm again or just listen to customers, what would cause you to personally have a bad day, and then just emit an event when that occurs. And then you could just make a stacked bar chart of all the bad day reasons and the frequency by which they're happening, and it's eye-opening to see those frequencies. And it's kind of a metric I hadn't thought about until Stripe's scale, in which you just don't know what's happening until you emit the log line and count it. The frequencies could be...

Jeff Weinstein (01:02:03):
... emit the log line and count it. The frequencies could be kind of mind-blowing. And I think for almost any scale business, if you are bored one day and you're not sure what to measure, just make a user having a bad day chart, emit a log line and count it as a bar chart and then anybody else can add their own bar chart on top of it. And so, it's become a way for teams to scale their understanding of users through metrics by just saying, "Hey, look, anytime anybody has an idea about why a customer is having a bad day, just emit a log line, put it on this chart, and then we can choose over time which bad day reasons we want to burn down and hopefully just eradicate them, not just minimize them.

(01:02:41):
But it gave us kind of a background noise counting system for where there are problems and anytime there's an incident or some customer issue, the first thing I think is, "Ooh, I wonder if we have a bad day reason for this." And if we do, I actually feel okay. I'm like, "Oh yeah, it is a bad day for this customer." I wish I didn't have it, but at least we're aware and we can evaluate it against other bad days that we want to burn down. What does sometimes a little bit grind my gears or gives us an opportunity is like when we didn't know about that bad day. And it's a surprise to us too, that is for me is immediate action. It's like, okay, cool. We have to figure out a way to count this bad day. We got to get it on the chart. That way we can make an informed decision about when to invest improving it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:35):
And I love this idea. I haven't heard this before. So the idea is just make a list of what happens to a potential customer that would cause them to have a bad day. What are some examples for Striper Atlas that you guys have?

Jeff Weinstein (01:03:45):
Are you a Stripe customer, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:47):
I am with my newsletters. The payments go through Stripe. I check my dashboard every day.

Jeff Weinstein (01:03:52):
Cool. So what would be a bad day for you?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:53):
Oh, I see some silence happening here. It not loading. The numbers taking a long time to show up. Something being completely off in there, not being able to log in. The silence is good. I just want to keep going.

Jeff Weinstein (01:04:19):
The question is how much to the audience is how much of the silence will we edit out before it goes live? But this is what I'm talking about, right, is I could guess them, right? And as you were saying those, I know the URL of those charts. I know the login one because I feel that too. So I play with Stripe all the time and then you get a two FA too frequently and come on, I had the same cookie. I was just here yesterday. So we count all that stuff and try to make it better over time. But I'm so excited when someone brings me a new bad day I hadn't thought about yet because that's like product cabinet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:00):
I love it. And your advice here is this doesn't necessarily have to be your goal or metric. It's just watching this thing that could lead to a lot of interesting ways of operating.

Jeff Weinstein (01:05:10):
A couple other just like quick metrics things because it's a bit of a... I don't know, some people like cycling or something. I guess, I like metrics. People get a really nice bike. I want a really great metric. Picking metric titles that make you feel something. So we could have called that measure of companies, number of companies that do not send a support ticket over X period and Y period with min... You sometimes see these charts where the metric itself named itself. This is just companies with zero support, that's it. And the brevity and the focus and the customer mindset built into the chart name can become currency inside the company. It's like, oh, I'm working on making this chart go up and it feels good to just say the name out loud rather than some complicated underscores and mins and maxes and the database field name is still in the chart title.

(01:06:26):
These are aesthetic choices, but I think make dramatic differences in the cultural willingness for people to buy in and get excited about it and reduce the need of a product person to just remind everyone every day why they're doing it. It's like the metric is motivating us because it's a motivating thing to talk about. And then lastly on metrics is there's just good hygiene that people should bring to their measures. Percentages shouldn't have 41 significant digits if only two of the digits are relevant. You should keep all the measures of your dashboard on the same X-axis. These are just stylistic things that increase the frequency that people want to just wake up every day and open the dashboard and look at it. And that is so powerful if your whole team is looking at the same set of information that has the heartbeat of the customer every single day.

(01:07:26):
In fact, we can measure at Stripe the usage of our dashboards by team, and so we can see which teams are themselves looking at their own metrics and that is an incredibly useful predictor of how on the same page they are and how customer obsessed they are. So I just think it's not an area that's sort of behind the scenes, bean counting reliability is the machine hot. You can make metrics that mean something to the customer and you would be proud if they were to be screenshot and put on the internet and be like, "Wow, I feel like that company is taking their promise to me seriously. And I can see myself on those metrics as a customer." That's where we're really shooting for.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
So [inaudible 01:08:19] back what you just said there, which I think is a subtle point potentially, is just making the dashboard look nice, like the hygiene of the naming conventions and the decimal points and the chart. In your experience, you find that really powerful and important.

Jeff Weinstein (01:08:34):
A couple of years ago, Stripe did internal work to make an internal metrics kind of dashboard system. And we have a special place called Go Metrics. Many people use a go/service where you can just quickly go to a URL. And again, I have to sometimes do a rule rather than a policy. My rule is if it's not on Go Metrics, I'm not going to look at it. So if people can send me one-off queries or charts or screenshots or presentations or emails of charts and data, but that is in the wind, we can't interrogate the query metrics are almost always wrong. For many weeks, we didn't quite get the definition correctly. You have to live in the metric for quite a while before you really believe in it. And so, if you're always looking at some one-off version, it's just very difficult for it to rise up to the level of importance that is a thing we should trust to help us decide what to do. That's an incredibly high bar. And so, I just find you have to look at it frequently enough.

(01:09:46):
And if you're going to look at it frequently enough, it means it needs to be in a discoverable place. You almost go through a couple stages of grief about it because we'll kind of put a metric up in a place and everyone initially is like, "Wow, this is great. I was so excited to finally see this." And then a couple of days later, "I don't quite understand it. What does it actually mean? I saw this other metric from this other angle that kind of makes it feel counterintuitive that it's like this." And then you kind of look into it, "Wait a second, we've been counting it wrong the whole time. Oh, no." And then you look at it the third week and it's a completely different version and then you hope that we forget about it and maybe we'll go onto something else and nope, we're not going to forget about it. Week four comes around, you're like, "Wait a second. Okay, this is..." Then the team meeting starts, "Hey, just a reminder, let's just bring up the metric again, not a screenshot of it. Go to the URL."

(01:10:39):
And just that level of frequency and specificity and ritual around it is what brings it into the decision-making culture. And again, we treat it the exact same as we do tweets. It's the quantitative and qualitative right next to each other. And because you're putting that amount of attention to it, you can't have a 1,000 metrics. We just don't physically have time the day to bring that level of care and understanding to so many things. So then it forces you to know so many things you could care about down to a small number of things that you really must care about. And again, that practice goes back to do you really understand what your customer wants? And so, for all these tactics, it's about finding out what your customer wants and then different versions of how do we sort of know it's true over time and our tactics improving?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:32):
It sounds so simple when you describe it that way. This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams. And the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations. Or you can use an all-in-one document SDK. Most product managers will tell you paperwork sucks. Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features.

(01:12:24):
For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's Dragon Drop Builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil, that's useanvil.com/lenny to learn more or start a free trial. That's useanvil.com/lenny. Kind along these same lines, there's something that I've learned you started at Stripe to help people obsess with user experience and get quality to where it needs to be and move a lot of these metrics, something called Study Groups. Talk about what that is. I'm very curious.

Jeff Weinstein (01:13:19):
Okay, let's imagine we understand our customer, we've understand their burning problem. We've built a solution that's in their hands, they're using, it's hopefully better than their alternatives and they're starting to use it and we have some real traction. You could still measure the success, you could still look at the tweets and then, of course, you go to pick it up yourself and you're like, "Wait a second, this thing is horrible. How did it get so bad?" Anyone who's built a product that has gone over the horizon of it's actually in production and being used for a year or more as you go to iterate on it, especially when you're in a larger company and there's multiple teams and multiple products going on, there's just some entropy in the world that causes these things to go bad. I actually have a hard time naturally explaining it.

(01:14:13):
You kind of think to yourself, well, it's code. It just must be running the same every day. But somehow you do enough things in a row. And what was once a smooth end-to-end flow for accomplishing a test or a customer is all of a sudden some Byzantine complicated broken mall where all the doors are busted and you have to know exactly the way to get through the dashboard to solve your problem. "Wait a second, I thought this was great just a second ago." And many of us have experienced that. Now, okay, what are we going to do about it? Well, one is it is really difficult to take time during the day to allow yourself to even know that this is true. Because if you're working on one particular team, you're going to have some next thing you're shipping, you're going to have your customers, you're going to be doing great product work.

(01:15:14):
Meanwhile, your current thing kind of starts to rot in the world and decrease all the trust you've earned to build what you're building now. It is actually difficult to decide, well, what hours during the week am I going to block off from my future progress to see it from the customer's perspective today? And there are various techniques to try to incentivize or to structure a group of people to do that. Stripe has a thing called friction logs as well, which is a single individual will pretend to be a customer and go through a product experience end-to-end and write it down. And that has been quite successful at Stripe for very motivated people who can block off the time and have the wide enough context to do a complicated thing end-to-end and have the time to write it up and the position the company to send it out as a critique potentially to not just your own team but in a whole organization.

(01:16:31):
So that's actually a pretty high bar to crossover. So I was kind of brainstorming what could we do to make this more fun and have the frequency which we're looking at our own products dramatically increase? And we kind of iterated few through ideas. And I landed on this thing called Study Group, which is basically a random group of people inside the company. They might not work on any particular team. They might not all be PMs, just like literally anyone who wants to sign up, a support person, a sales person, someone who's on our events team, an engineer and our infrastructure stack. Anybody can sign up for a Study Group. We show up maybe four to eight people total. We pretend to be some company with some outcome problem. Maybe we want to accept money in person at an upcoming farmer's market, or we want to run a multi-country global business where we have software that another business would use to run their business. If it was something quite complicated.

(01:17:38):
We could pick any motivating goal. And there are two rules to Study Group rule one is you do no longer work at Stripe. You do not work at Stripe, not pretend, don't work at Stripe, not try to forget you do not work at Stripe, you've never worked at Stripe. You work at... And we make up a name of the company, Dolphin Aquarium Industries, and we will pick a CEO of the company from the group amongst us. And okay, Jenny is the CEO. "Hey, Jenny, what do you want to do today?" "Well, I want to sell in-person tickets to the Dolphin Aquarium." It's like, "Cool, where would just start?" So we actually embody the customer. We will not break character, it's a little bit of the improv thing and as the kind of maestro of Study Group, I will firmly but kindly, if I hear you use any internal Stripe knowledge, which is natural to do, because, well, you worked on a team and you know where that button really is.

(01:18:41):
And the docs link goes a little bit to the wrong place, but if you click the other link, you'll get to it. If I can see you use any internal Stripe knowledge, I'll just pause and say, "Hey, let's redo the sentence or redo what we did with no Stripe knowledge. As a reminder, you don't work at Stripe." And it takes us a couple of times, but people really get into it and all of a sudden we'll start making up characters and the CEO will be like, "Oh, Tim, you're our designer. Where are we going to get the color palette?" All of a sudden there's a person who's not a designer in real life is now all of a sudden having to practice the empathy to be in a customer's position. And because we're going to be doing it for an hour, hour and a half at a time, you actually start to believe that you don't work at Stripe and you work at Dolphin Aquarium Industries and you start to really feel it.

(01:19:34):
So that's rule one. You don't work at Stripe. And rule two is we're not here to solve any problems. We're not here to critique, we're not here to solution or suggest, we're not here to file bugs. All of those things is recorded. We can do that later, whatever. This is just about practicing empathy for the customer and going through the product. And we have done more than 25 of these at Stripe thus far in just this year, last few months of 2024, more than 250 people have participated in the Study Group. And it is deeply eyeopening for those involved. The responses are sort of business emotional, not super emotional, but just, "Wow, I can't believe how hard it was to accomplish X, Y and Z. I thought we were amazing at blah." It's like, "Well, we actually are still pretty good, but we need to get back towards amazing" or Wow, "I didn't even know that internally people wouldn't know that our products did 1, 2, and 3."

(01:20:45):
And this has become so internally popular that teams have adopted for themselves. And so, we've kind of franchised Study Group internally already where different teams will run it. But I think we're going to continue it because I think a little bit is coming out of the pandemic. People just want more group activities. I think some of it is the slowness by which we do it. We're not rushing through it. Which another reason I appreciate your podcast as well is let's really get into the details and not be rushed for time. You forget that you have a meeting at the end kind of amount of time. No one is to blame or defensive because it's not your product at all. It's a random group of people. We don't even introduce ourselves about what team we worked on. We're just all here as participants to embody the customer. And then I think lastly, a reason why it's worked, and these are many of these just been actually super surprising to me.

(01:21:39):
I wouldn't have been able to prick ahead of time, is it's just fun. People want to make up the name of the company. They're excited about what Dolphin Industries would sell. A person who's not a CTO in real life gets to pretend to be a CTO and there's little theatrics to it, but it has been different enough from our other approaches for a company like Stripe, which is already pretty focused on this topic, that we think that there's enough legs here that we're going to keep it and kind invest in groups pretending to be the customer and going through it painstakingly slowly rather than only demos or only writing, which has other benefits, but misses the participation of a larger group and more fresh eyes. So it's been fun and we named it Study Group. I guess, I named it Study Group because I wasn't sure it would be initially. So I just came up with something that sounded cutesy, but gave me enough leeway that we could kind of adjust it over time. And this is where we've landed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):
It's fascinating that there's so much theatrics and ceremony necessary for a product team and a company to find out these things about their product. You would think people are like, "Oh, we know how onboarding looks. We know all these things," but basically what you're saying is you don't, and you need to do these sorts of things in order to really know what your product is like these days.

Jeff Weinstein (01:23:20):
The customer does not live in our walls. They aren't. They're not here. They don't know our lingo. And it is just so natural for our internal mindset and lingo to flow into the application over time. And you need some counterbalance to get there. And I think it has to be an unnatural counterbalance. It used to frustrate me actually more like, "Wow, why aren't we doing this?" Well, we're actually doing great work to move something forward and we have our local optimizations. It'd be difficult to get to this level of specialization that multi-product companies are trying to do without that level of focus on a per team basis, but then you need something unnatural to help us bring it back.

(01:24:12):
And so, I'm constantly looking for non-punitive fun ways objectively to get more perspectives from the outside in. If it's breaking the fourth wall to get on the phone on Twitter, if it's looking at a metric of users having a bad day, which is just like counting what's happening, you can't argue with that. Or a random group of people just kind of scratching their head trying to find a button, those are truths in the world that we're trying to make sure are inputs to all of our teams. And if you don't have those inputs, I can totally naturally see where the entropy of the world leads you to have Frankenstein bad products, even when all the individual parts are well oiled and run by great people. So you need something unnatural.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):
There's an interesting trend and thread through our talk so far broadly, there's just an obsession with making something great and awesome. And then a layer below is just an obsession with the user experience being as great as possible. And for a lot of PMs, there's not a direct line between make the experience as amazing as possible to growth and revenue and success and things like that. And it feels like for you and for Stripe broadly, there's this innate implication. If we're making the experience better and better and better, we will grow. You're nodding your head a little sideways a little bit, so I'd love to hear just your thoughts on just this obsession with experience and user issues. But we also have to go to the business. What are the metrics are moving?

Jeff Weinstein (01:25:51):
If someone else has a strategy for moving revenue that isn't getting it from customers, I want to know about it because it's so hard to get it from customers. If there's some faster path, please tweet me and tell me about it because this is very hard, a lot of work to do. So if there's something else, I want it on the table, but I often find it's part of the product experience. So maybe it's internal sales tools. We can do a Study Group about our internal sales tools process and our deal desk and our margin structure. We can do a friction log on our third party vendor process or a migration service or the way an ecosystem partner helps deploy our services into a big enterprise. Nothing is sort of off limits from product. In fact, I was chatting with a friend who runs the company and they were small company on the verge of product market fit starting to feel, customers starting to pull and they're like, "Oh, but our self-service funnel, it's so leaky and we have all this support coming through self-service."

(01:27:03):
First of all, congratulations, unbelievable that they're going through your product, even attempting self-service and contacting you. The majority case would be no one tries or they try and fail and don't contact you. So again, what a problem to have. And two, they wanted to minimize the support. In that particular case, it's like, "Well, what's actually in those support tickets? What's in those sales? Those are really sales contacts." They're like, "Oh, they want to learn more about how they get started." They want to know the expertise about... This is a particular company, it's a healthcare related company. They wanted to know the healthcare choices available. They wanted to know how to migrate from some old system they had to it.

(01:27:41):
I was like, "That's the product. The thing you're talking about is the product." Turn those moments during your self-serve process into not self-serve and make the product experience be let's get you on the phone. And now when they get on the phone, they know the first name of the person they're talking to because they have it from the onboarding forum and all of a sudden it feels like you are still in the product, but it's not software. Now it's a person, but it's a person backed by internal software, which knows as much as they can about the customer and what they want. And I was really inspired by Fidelity, which is a big financial institution where many people listening might have switched jobs and had to move their 401(k) or something like this from job A to job B. Maybe in some universe it'll be three clicks, but not today or certainly not when I tried a couple of years ago. You got a call and go on a phone tree and all the shenanigans, and then I got on the line with someone from Fidelity. They're like, "Hi, Jeff. They knew about the old company. They confirmed my address." They said, "By the way, this is not a digital process yet. We're going to FedEx you an envelope and inside it is going to be the thing for you to sign. Here's going to be exactly where to sign. Here's a picture we're going to sign. We've put another envelope inside that envelope ready to go. And so, you just take the papers from envelope one, sign them where it says and put them in envelope two and put it back to the [inaudible 01:29:16]."

(01:29:15):
It's like, "Wow, that is product." That is a product experience where I think some people would say, "Oh look, the product experience has to only be in software." So I feel when people think, oh, product quality and craft has some limit towards business value, there's some asymptote that you have to be like, well, kind of product plate time quality is over. We need to talk about business. It's like, let's figure out exactly what is causing the business to happen and make a product, even if it doesn't look naturally the same as our SaaS, software, browser, mobile, whatever versions. I think we can see the entire experience as it. And from there, I include the sales process, I include the support process, I include tools that help with compliance and everything else. And again, if people have a way to make all those things bad and lead to great increasing revenue over time in sustainable ways, I want to know about that because that sounds so much easier than the version that we're trying.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:23):
I love that and clearly it's worked for Stripe. Just one last question. I want to talk about Atlas and dive into just like what is Atlas and how is it doing and things like that. I know there's some new stuff coming that you're going to share, but one last question about Study Groups. How do you decide what product you're going to pick to do a Study Group on? And then what is the expectation with the result? I imagine there's a PM sitting around like, "Oh my God, I just got this 10 page report on all the problems."

Jeff Weinstein (01:30:48):
So initially, I just made up a list of stuff that I thought would be fun to Study Group to kind of kick it off. And now, because it has a bit of an internal brand and it's exciting, and people who have gone to a Study Group say nice things about Study Group there, they actually proactively say, "Hey, we should Study Group blah," or "We're launching something next week. We should Study Group it before it goes out the door." Or now I actually just have a huge backlog of things to Study Group based on what people want. And now we're again franchising it. So we're going to have Study Group captains and people run their own Study Groups, and so we can really scale this behavior. But we did our first Study Group of an internal tool recently. And so, that I think is going to catch on just anything at all can be Study Group. It just takes about an hour and a couple of people and you open up the Zoom and that's it.

(01:31:37):
And then for expectation wise, look, it is so tempting to put more regulation on something. Okay, well, everything coming out of this program needs to be scored and rubricked and have SLAs. That is extremely reasonable. As some of these next steps, we do notice things that are of serious issues and we have some formal processes inside of Stripe for elevating bugs to certain priority levels that get tagged and have SLAs for teams to acknowledge and review. And so we kind of funnel the outputs of a Study Group into our already existing formal processes rather than having some new special thing that's going to bother a particular team. I will say though that it is difficult to watch one of these Study Groups and if you are the team involved in some piece of it and not want to act on it, because seeing your fellow teammates struggle to use your thing in some way is more motivating than the customer because you can kind of always say to the customer, " Well, they didn't really know," or "They have some special setup."

Jeff Weinstein (01:33:03):
Well, they didn't really know or they have some special setup. You probably shouldn't say those things, but you can kind of rationalize it, whereas a group of people incentivized to have actually accomplished it, who got together to do so painstakingly slowly not being able to do so if that's not what excites you as a product person to want to solve, this thing's not for you. But then again, you have your own organization system, you have your own things you need to ship and study group doesn't have a mandate that comes from it. We have our own. It's more of a cultural piece of information that is very high signal and then people tend to use that high signal for good prioritization. I will say though, that we have added the SLAs to certain bug levels that begin to match a bit of our incident process.

(01:34:01):
So in an incident strike, like in many companies, pencils down, fix the problem, severity levels, non-negotiable Slack rooms happen, war rooms, all that stuff. You don't want to do that with every single bug, but we have a rubric of craft related tags for our bug system. And if it is a sort of a P0 bug, which is not an incident, right, it doesn't mean to put down your pencils. You do need to acknowledge it at Stripe within seven days. And even if it doesn't mean to fix it, it's like a person looks at it and says, "Hey, we're going to do it or not do it." That's a still pretty strong bar for a non-incident related craft issue.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:45):
It feels just at Stripe, there's this cultural focus on we want to make the product great, we want to make the experience as great as possible. A lot of companies, it's just teams. We have this goal. We're not going to do anything that isn't driving this metric and goal that we have. And I think for teams like that, it's hard to hear just like, oh, someone's going to send you all of these problems that you experience. There's the negative version where the founders goes through the product like a CO of a larger company, just, oh my God, look at all these problems. You need to fix these immediately. And a lot of times it's completely distracting from the things they need to do, the goals they're trying to drive, things that really, really matter that the CO may not be thinking about. And it feels like you're trying to find this balance of here's problems that exist. You don't need to fix them. You probably should. Here's the most important stuff. But also there's often you find a correlation between make the experience better, you're going to do better.

Jeff Weinstein (01:35:37):
There's a huge amount of trust here involved in your colleagues, which is we want to provide teams great information and the best teams welcome that information. It doesn't mean that it comes with a auteur opinion from the outside world that says you must do X. We have a rubric on some of the craft related bugs, but again, we let the teams relabel them. And so maybe it's actually not a P0 from their eyes and that's the trust we put in the teams. I think that the failure mode is when you don't look. And so we need unnatural, safe, fun lore that gets us out of our chair and into the customer's mindset. Best is if it's you and you're your own customer, okay. Second best would be sitting right next to the customer in the outside world and then like, okay, fine, I'll take a third best, which is pantomime the customer and enforcing you don't use any internal knowledge. If you have practices in those three categories, I'm comfortable with the failure modes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:56):
I love that. This is definitely going to be the longest episode I've ever done, which is exactly what I expected and I'm happy that we're doing this.

Jeff Weinstein (01:37:04):
Everyone go 1.75X or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:07):
I like when people are like, oh, this episode is really good. I had to slow down to 1.75 or something. How are you even listening at that speed? No, it's 1.0 speed. That's what this episode needs to be. There's two more areas I want to spend some time on. One is Atlas. We've talked a lot about on the surface of Atlas. I want to help people understand what the hell it is and the stuff that's happening there. And two, I want to talk about getting stuff done at a big company, something that you've done at Stripe and I hear you have a lot of good advice on. So first of all, what is Atlas? We've talked a bit about it. What's the best way to understand what Atlas is and who it's for?

Jeff Weinstein (01:37:42):
In 2016, a bunch of Stripes were traveling the world, Stripes is what we call teammates here, and they're just hearing stories from entrepreneurs around the world. And you would hear this unbelievable story from incredible entrepreneurs who have a laptop, which is that they'd have to fly to the United States on an airplane to make a US company in order to get access to use financial system, to raise money from US or global investors, often to take USD or to charge US customers. And you could have sat around and said, huh, is that illegal? They don't live in the US. Can they have a US company? Absolutely. The US loves this. It is incredibly encouraged for people from around the world to make a US company and many people do.

(01:38:38):
Now, why did it require an airplane, right? And so you start to hear that kind of thing at a coffee shop amongst someone with a laptop who has access to the whole internet. And that is a burning problem. Right. That is not a tier three issue. I am not able to run my business without getting on an airplane should be sending alerts off in your whole psyche that you have discovered something important. And so I wasn't at Stripe at the time, but I'm very thankful that, I was running my own startup at the time. I was very thankful that the people at Stripe decided to try to tackle that problem. And so Atlas is a way to start a company in a few clicks, and we think that's an incredibly big deal because while there are smart humans across the whole planet, the opportunity that they have is not uniform. But it's a little strange because it's all the same MacBooks and it's a little strange because it's all the same IP addresses and we all have plenty of bandwidth and smarts.

(01:39:49):
And so what can we do to dramatically lower the barrier to great people solving problems? And we've found over and over again that increasing the ease and simplicity and decreasing the cost and complexity tends to lead to just more of that thing. And we have a fundamental belief that there should be more startups and they're not finite. And that belief comes from both just a core hope because there are so many problems in the world that don't seem to be being solved fast enough by our current institutions and larger companies that we think will actually, we need entrepreneurial energy to tackle them. And then it's also comes from experience of seeing it happened. Instacart signed up for Stripe with a Gmail address and then Covid happened and they delivered critical food to everyone when people were reasonably not allowed to go to the grocery store easily.

(01:40:53):
So you just don't know what the next Gmail address is going to do. And so in Atlas, we radically try to simplify the process of getting a company started and that mission has taken us to just solve more of the problem over time. And so over the last few years, for those who have either used Atlas or have started a company or maybe follow along on Twitter a bit, you might've seen just a progression of complexity that used to exist being automated. And so a big one that we did about a year ago was this 83(b) election, which is this absolutely Byzantine silliness system by which you have 30 calendar days to send a one-page document to the IRS that could radically change the economics of how you are incentivized as a founder. And this is not one of these greedy loophole. The IRS in the 1980s made this IRS rule in order to spur more entrepreneurship.

(01:42:07):
They want this. And the only issue is they made it extremely difficult to accomplish. You have to send a snail mail in to an IRS address in a particular format, in a particular way with no verification that it happened at all. And if you do it 31 calendar days, there's no redo. Okay. Now again, if you're a product person, you hear the founders terrified all day long about this same issue, just alarm bells in your head whole time. And so I had experienced it for myself as a founder several times, and I also just heard story after story and I just put on my to-do list for the team, we are going to solve this 83(b) election thing. And there are very good reasons not to do it because it comes with potential huge liability. Don't want to screw it up, it's snail mail.

(01:42:54):
You're really going to monetize this. It's a competitive advantage to do it. You can kind of argue yourself not to do it in a million ways. But again, back to the mission of just taking all of this complexity and turning into a single click. It was obvious to us and we got started on it. Infrastructurally, we've been automating these steps and when this podcast airs, I guess today, it will be true that when you go to start a company on Atlas, it will just be a single click.

(01:43:26):
You go to type in your friend's names, what the name of the company will be, it'll tell you if it's available automatically or not. You can split the company up 50, 50 or whatever you want to do, fill out a few things and you click go and then like a burrito coming to you, like a pizza tracker, we will just handle all of the downstream activities that used to be, hey, remember to come back in and purchase your shares. Why am I purchasing my shares? I'm just getting started. Why am I writing a check for $10 and putting into a bank account that I can't even open yet? And then I have to wait for that to be done to get the 83(b) [inaudible 01:44:09]. All of those steps are now just handled in the background so that we can get you ready for business in a day or two.

(01:44:17):
And so this is our vision. So you can quit your job on a Sunday night, get the Sunday scaries, I'm done with this thing, and on Monday morning fill out this form and the next day be able to run a billion-dollar business because we will have automatically handled getting you access to banking systems, to payment systems, to handling all the equity paperwork, filing your 83(b) election where you can just shift from having worrying about the company starting process to just building and shipping.

(01:44:52):
And you'll just get kind updates in the background. Cool, the IRS is giving you a tax ID. Cool, your 83(b) election is filed. Cool, all the founders have their equity and you're ready to go on the cap table. And we've done this by deeply integrating with the governments and deeply integrating with banking partners where we can get you access to the financial system before the IRS and the other governments come back with their sort of official yeses because we take care of the problem in the background by which we're faxing, phone calling, filling out forms on your behalf. And so we just want to take all that complexity and just erase it so that you get the same thing the YC group gets when they start, that checklist that they go through. We just have the robot do exactly the same thing.

(01:45:45):
And so in some ways it is a really big deal in a big ship because it completely automates the company starting process. But in other ways it's an incredibly incremental step that it's taken us three years to get to where we had to systematically automate the internal steps, each one and now we've done the work to wrap it all up into one button. And you can just watch how your company's doing in the dashboard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:16):
Well, first of all, congrats Jeff and the Atlas team on shipping this. I know this is a big milestone and it's been a long time coming.

Jeff Weinstein (01:46:21):
Yeah, Atlas was actually a little reasonable before we decided to do all this work. It's like why do this next step of completely automating it when it was actually fairly straightforward before. Atlas has above 80 NPS, which is quite high. Apple is in the low 60s, AirPods is 75. I love my AirPods. So Atlas in the 80s with almost 50% response rate is quite high. And so we still chose to do another year of work to automate all of this work behind the scenes because we see that companies are charging their customers sooner when they go through this automated process versus waiting. And it's a little strange. You just started your company. Well, what does it really matter to wait an extra seven days or 20 days before you can really get going on business? Those are really fragile days which you're building. And to some of our conversation earlier, that amazing feeling of getting your first customer and being in it with them and money actually exchanging hands and getting that relationship.

(01:47:34):
If we can slide that forward in the world by a couple of days or weeks, which we're seeing, like half the time it takes to get to your first customer, just shave a whole week off of your company and you can kind of see GDP being born sooner. And went my whole life knowing that okay, GDP is not finite and it can grow, but I've never really seen it and now I've actually seen it grow faster, sooner. And I think anything we could do to just move that forward is going to inspire and lower the bar for more people to be an entrepreneur because they'll see how satisfying that can be.

(01:48:21):
And another stat, which really was interesting to me recently is that we have seen since doing much of this automation work, that more solo founders are using Atlas than ever before. And I think it's because you can just do a lot more on the internet as a founder with no-code tools and everything else and get going. Very cool to see that bringing the best of the internet and making it available worldwide can be correlated with more people becoming entrepreneurs. And I think we should just keep doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:55):
It's incredibly inspiring and I think this is going to be a huge deal. It's hard to think about how many, what sorts of changes in tech could transform how many companies are started and how many companies not just started but actually happen because to your point, you may start and they're like, nah, nevermind a few days later if it's still stuck in some queue.

Jeff Weinstein (01:49:13):
Totally. And then you don't know where these things are going to go. We have the sort of cohort of 2024 startups in Atlas got to $50 million in revenue twice as quickly as the cohort in 2023. And so we kind of also think sometimes, oh, it was the pandemic that pushed everything online. Those are our best years. It's like we're seeing the earliest cohort charts of new startups just cracking up into the right. And that's very exciting because you also hear sometimes, well the funding market is down and valuations and this and that and the other. That is much more of a point in time capital analysis and much less business, like just how businesses are working day to day. It's really in the revenue that is representative of their futures and that looks amazingly bright.

(01:50:05):
And then of course these companies go off to do pretty wild things. Companies that have started through Atlas, there's been 55,000 of them to date are doing $5 billion a year in revenue. I think it actually resets their expectations of what other tools will be in the future. It's like, well, if it was so easy for me to get my company started, well why is it so hard to do banking? Well, thankfully there are some great services for it, but I think if we can push people towards expectations higher, then they will want to make their companies better and we'll just all benefit from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:38):
How much of this is based on you guys sending faxes and sending mail yourself, like I don't know how much you can talk about the behind the scenes, but is there a lot of, through this ops element to automating some of this?

Jeff Weinstein (01:50:51):
Atlas is in total 10 people, which is I think a relatively small group for the role that it plays in the wider startup ecosystem. And we just don't pick up work we can't automate because we know that we need the leverage. And so we're not going to put ourselves in situations in which we have to compete to be the best. We're going to put ourselves in situations where we can automate it and be the only, and that's a different mindset. So in terms of why we picked up 83(b) election as a topic, when we made that decision, we made a commitment that we're going to do this forever. We're going to do this forever. This is a piece of infrastructure for the rest of the internet. That is a very high bar to set as the thing you're going to do.

(01:51:50):
And so we're happy to take our time. This is part, versus like go-go-go versus the long-term compounding. Go-go-go was when we assigned one engineer, hey, it's your job today to send one piece of paper to the office with this third party mail service. Why? Doesn't matter. Today, just send a single piece of paper to the office and an incredible engineer, and she went on to lead all of 83(b) election work. She sent it. And the proof of just receiving the piece of paper at the office that we had just sent yesterday is incredible proof. Right. We're like, well look. I mean, the 83(b) election is just sending this piece of paper to the IRS, like we just did it. Right.

(01:52:37):
That go-go-go as soon as possible was extremely useful because it's just like, look, this exists. We can do it. Come on. On the long-term compounding part, we were extremely serious about how we picked our third party vendors, and backup vendors, and what promises, and SLAs, and reporting systems, and alerts, and playbooks, and backup processes, like it's in a very intense amount of internal structure we use. But again, we have to look at where the value is. The value is in making sure it happens. Does it need to be us sending the mail? Does it need to be us talking to government? Not necessarily. And we have chosen to work with third parties and many backup third parties as well because one, there's expertise in the world of physically printing and sending mail that the 10 of us are not going to today become experts in. And two, I think it also causes us to build better software in that we now need to evaluate if something's actually working because it's happening externally.

(01:53:39):
Whereas when you build it yourself, again, you have this natural feeling, well, we built it. It must be working. Oh, later we'll add alerts. Later when there problems, we'll figure out playbooks. Well look, when it's a third party building it, you're like, wait a second. What happens if they screw up? Like cool, we better figure that out. We better OCR all the results. We better do all these check sums, we better... And it would be awesome if we could always treat our internal work that way, but because it was external, it forced us to be more rigid where we needed to be rigid and create interfaces and kind of commitments. And again, we work with a bunch of great third parties and back up third parties to execute this. And each year we write a document called Should We Do This Ourselves? And we look at the other nine of us around the room and go, of course we shouldn't. Let's go on to something else. So again, we're just really stitching it together, but ensuring that it happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:31):
Awesome. Okay. I was imagining fax machines just,-

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:34):
There are fax machines occurring. There are fax machines occurring,-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:37):
Not in the Stripe [inaudible 01:54:38].

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:38):
And there are phone calls being made and there are robots waiting on phones on hold as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:44):
Oh, amazing.

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:45):
There's quite a lot going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:47):
AI is here. I saw a stat that one in six new Delaware corporations are now started on Stripe Atlas. That's absurd.

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:54):
Yep. I'm very excited to tell you when it's one in five, but it is not today.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:59):
Okay, sounds like we're close.

Jeff Weinstein (01:55:01):
We're on our way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:55:02):
Sounds like we're close. The other stat I have here is that the fastest growing cities for startups. Here's what I have, I don't know if you know this, but Boulder, Shenzhen, and Las Vegas.

Jeff Weinstein (01:55:13):
They're everywhere. One of the, it's like stat we kind of came up with a little bit last year that I'm just personally deeply obsessed with is founding teams in which the co-founders are in multiple countries. So we kind of nickname this. Again, it's like giving things a good title, headlines. Cross-Border Founders. Wow. More than 20% of multi-founder teams have at least one founder from another country. That is astounding to me, that the internet could bring people together like that. And I think that's going to provide more perspectives, more solutions will be local and global. Just all perspectives are great. And again, I think the Atlas team itself represents this. We were very intentional of how we built the Atlas team. It's majority women and we have more diversity to hire, but we're just very intentional to make it a team that had diverse perspectives. You've been on teams that don't have diverse perspectives of any type. They are so much worse. There's no real science necessary here. We just enforce that. We had the opportunity to build this team that way.

(01:56:36):
And it was really important to me that it represented a world we wanted things to look like and to represent. And it just had to be very intentional about it because I've made mistakes in my career previously where my startup was all men when we sold to box one of them. And on each hire it was harder and harder and harder to hire someone of a different background. Just naturally folks didn't want to join that type of team. And that was the last time I've ever going to make that mistake, which is that early the candidate poll must match where you want the team to go. It's not a down funnel problem, it is an up funnel problem. And where you have to just make sure that for each role you're comfortable with the distribution of people and backgrounds in your candidate pool and go from there. And I think that is one of the reasons why that 10 person group is so effective, is it has just a lot of diversity and perspective.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:57:38):
Another skill Jeff Weinstein is incredible at that I wasn't even aware of. We're going to add them to the list and I actually saw a photo of the team and I noticed that. And so great work. Is there anything else on Atlas that you wanted to share before I get into how you actually made Atlas happen at a company like Stripe that has a billion things to do?

Jeff Weinstein (01:57:55):
We just want to hear about what's hard for you. If you look back in your emails and if you started a company recently, you're starting a company right now, the whole world is counting on you to pick a customer, solve their problem 10 times better than their alternative, get it to them, charge for it, become economically viable and build a great business that provides great services. We are not counting on you to become experts at this silliness of administratively running your company. Imagine life without Google Docs where you'd have to hire an IT person to run your IT back end on employee three. You'd have an IT person or imagine the world without AWS for EC2 or S3 or any of these cloud services and you're racking computers yourself.

(01:58:46):
You're just absolutely not going to try as many things. We just see the company structure, the structure, bringing people together to be like that, and we want to automate more and more and more of it and turn it into software. So we're looking for the next things to work on. We have a couple ideas, but we expect to turn more of groups of people working together, that administration into software. And I think it's just going to unlock huge amount more people choosing to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:59:16):
Interesting. I'm so curious what that ends up being. If you really think about what you're doing here, if you believe that entrepreneurship and innovation and technology make the world better, you're creating such an unlock to allow more of that. And like I said, I think it's hard to imagine and think of other examples that could be as transformative and impactful as just making this process.

Jeff Weinstein (01:59:35):
It's funny because I go back to again, I also hear from founders, entrepreneurs like, oh, I can't think of an idea. Like, ah, I need a startup idea. And yet everything in the world is broken. And I also recall my first startup early 2010, 2012 ish, I joined a friend's company. That was started at the same time that the Stripe founders started Stripe. And that is, I think about that a lot because with the same information, knowing how hard it was to accept online payments, I chose to work on something else where they didn't. They worked on making it easy in seven lines of code to accept payments online, which turned out to be really useful.

(02:00:29):
So I really encourage people to be very sensitive to the problems that they see and just not let any little hiccup go unnoticed. And I think Atlas is really a manifestation of that, which is, let's actually look at every single thing. You went from hobby to economically successful operation and which of any moment along the way you shouldn't have had to do. And we think those things are a fair game to play with in any topic. I think that there are many more gigantic businesses, important things to be solved sitting in plain sight. I can't see them always, but when you hear, if you sit in enough silence and you hear the same people complain about problems, you too might find something as big as online payments are hard, which was sitting right in front of all of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:01:24):
And I think it's important to note, it doesn't necessarily have to be a venture-backed, venture scale company. Right. There are many, most businesses in the world are non venture-backed, venture scale billion-dollar companies. You can build a profitable company.

Jeff Weinstein (02:01:36):
It's kind of funny. We've all put this badge of honor of giving away a lot of your company. People really love owning a lot of their company and being successful. So you just got to pick the right capital structure for your business.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:01:57):
And again, the amount of money that has been generated of the companies that started through Atlas, you said $5 billion, basically that's the GDP of Atlas. That Atlas is,-

Jeff Weinstein (02:02:07):
And that's like revenue per year and that's growing,-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02:09):
Per year.

Jeff Weinstein (02:02:10):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02:10):
Yeah. And obviously a lot of it would've happened anyway, but still it accelerated. It's probably growing faster. A lot of it probably never would've happened otherwise. Yeah.

Jeff Weinstein (02:02:19):
We ran a survey a little bit ago, we need to rerun this, where we just asked people would they have started their business without Atlas. And about 20% of people said they wouldn't have or wouldn't had then. And again, these things are fragile. Right. And it's not all Google employees leaving their job to the build something. It's people from every possible background, every possible role, every possible job, every possible age group who see problems and can solve it. So it's dramatically more fragile than people think.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02:56):
Well, great work, Jeff, and team Atlas and Stripe in general.

Jeff Weinstein (02:03:00):
Fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:03:01):
Let's talk about one last thing. There's so many more things I still want to talk about. Maybe we'll have a,-

Jeff Weinstein (02:03:06):
We can go quick. Yeah, we can [inaudible 02:03:08].

Lenny Rachitsky (02:03:08):
Make it 2X speed. So Atlas is basically a zero to one product. I know you didn't start initially, it was there, but you took it from, I don't know, maybe you took it from 0.5 or something to one in 100 now, and a lot of people struggle with starting things like this within larger companies. Like Stripe's a large company, right? It's like a very innovative, well run company, but it's also a large company. And clearly you made shit happen, you and your team. What kind of things have you learned? Actually, let me read a quote. Here's a quote that kind of describes you being good at this from one of your former colleagues who will go unnamed. "Jeff is really good at cutting through the BS. You hear so much about frameworks and all this complicated stuff that people talk about, NPM circles, one of the most straightforward, obvious things probably right. I get so annoyed after calls with Jeff sometimes because I know he's right about something. I banged my head against the wall for months." And so talk about just what you've done, what you've learned about getting stuff done.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:04:03):
Talk about what you've done, what you've learned about getting stuff done at a large company. What do you need to do?

Jeff Weinstein (02:04:07):
Not having things be your idea I think is really powerful. I just talked to 50 customers who all yelled the same thing. Here they are in varieties of quotes and forms and the rest of it, and you put some three bullet points of strategy around why it's important, it's going to help you win more market share, and the rest of it and how you can do it well. Cool. What else could we want to do? Maybe somebody has something where 51 people have the same burning thing, but the majority failure mode is we do nothing. That's the majority failure mode. So one, aligning people with deep customer stories story boarding some solution visually with a Sharpie and not a pencil, not Figma initially, not high or low fidelity. I can never remember which one is the detailed one, but Sharpie. What is the unconstrained perfect solution to this burning problem?

(02:05:18):
That's Pixar-style storyboard. You don't need to be a designer. You can just draw stick figures on a piece of paper or whimsical or whatever you want to do. And with those things, if you're not asking for the sun and the moon on headcount and team size to make some forward progress, who could stop you? Let's get some first version working. It was very motivating to get that single piece of paper in the mail, which was blank, to kick us off on the 83(b) election. Again, by the time this podcast airs, we'll have crossed 10,000 83(b) elections filed, and we will have done them all 100.00% on time. With the burning use case, why customers are going to need it, why we can do it cheaply, effectively, safely over a long period of time, and here's the way to get tangible, forward progress quickly against the stick figure vision, but with something in the browser or one version of it. Let's just get one thing working one time.

(02:06:31):
I find proof of existence to be an incredibly powerful proof, rather than proof by theory or proof by debate. It's like, "Look, we did it one time. Hey, I'm holding the piece of paper." Pretty motivating. If we just printed out the right information, we'd be done. You're like, "Okay, actually there's a lot to do other than just that," but it really pushed us forward. Cutting through a little bit of the red tape is about momentum and making each step not such a big deal and asking for less permission. Then of course, once you have a little bit of that under your belt, you're going to naturally be trusted with taking more of those kinds of bets.

(02:07:24):
Paired with some of the things we talked about earlier of everyone's looking at the same place about the metrics, everyone can watch the success. We don't need to do big, internal updates with long-winded PowerPoint presentations and scrambles the night before. You can just go to the metrics page and see how we're doing. That brings so much trust to the group that people start going from, "Why do we have this Atlas thing that doesn't really produce so much money. It's charging companies when they don't have money. We're a big payments business. How do you even compare these things?" To "Wow, look at the progress that they're making against the mission, and look at its impact on the curves." And you start to root for it more.

(02:08:16):
I think that's how we got it there. I will say one other thing, which is that making something economically viable is extremely important. I am probably the fourth person to run Atlas, and it's quite a pantheon of people prior to me, including the founder of Mozi, which is a compliance startup, Watershed, which is this amazing climate reporting tool, also led Atlas, Patrick McKenzie, patio11, for many folks who [inaudible 02:08:46]

Lenny Rachitsky (02:08:46):
Wow, what an alumni group, this collection.

Jeff Weinstein (02:08:48):
We owe ourselves a dinner. We owe ourselves a dinner. Quite a group. And now we have a new person. I technically no longer lead Atlas, so we've hired up a whole team, which is really exciting. And Hayley Halvarsson, who's joined us about a year or two ago, she leads Atlas now and you can find her on Twitter. She's fantastic. We swap jobs over a course of a year, just one month at a time, the roles. And so she worked for me, then I worked for her, and she's gone off to hire some amazing people to run Atlas. So it's really quite a privilege to have these people lead it over time.

(02:09:22):
But it was really important for us to communicate why we were going to run this in an economically viable way, and I think that applies to all products and all businesses. It's like, "Look, if you're a customer acquisition-style product, showcase why this is the best customer acquisition for the dollar for the company. If you are a margin-generating, moat-creating, ecosystem-growing portion of the business, then your metrics have to show it." So you can't just have half the story of just the product quality and the tweets. You have to have the economics. Who else is going to put this much energy into this style of product and that gives us confidence that we should invest it in the long term? Because alternatives can come and go, and I super encourage there to be more Atlas alternatives. That'd be great for founders, but I think over the long term, it'll be difficult to do so because of the business model.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:10:19):
There actually was an alternative at one point, AngelList, and then they're like, "No, Stripe is killing it. Let's just send everyone to Atlas."

Jeff Weinstein (02:10:26):
I had worked on Stripe payments for a while, and I had just started on Atlas, and I think that same month AngelList announced that they were doing incorporation and banking and cap table all together, which was exactly what I wanted to do. I was like, "Oh shoot, did I sign up for the wrong thing? AngelList is such a smart group of people, so customer-oriented, great brand, I love many of the people that work there, they work with some of the best legal minds, and they have the RUV setup. There's so much awesomeness here." I was like, " Should we really compete? What should we do here?" And we thought about it more and more like, "Look, in the very long term, this company-starting process is going to become a efficiency cost problem, and there's so much long tail complexity with dealing with multiple financial institutions, multiple government processes, all of this legal complexity, and it's difficult to charge a lot of money for it because it's hard to charge people money when they haven't even started the business yet."

(02:11:36):
We looked at it and said, "Look, we're going to keep this long-term, compounding approach because we think that this is where it's going to go." And it was a zero interest rate environment at the time. AngelList built a phenomenal product. I looked at it with nothing but admiration and happiness, but it also smarted and hurt. We kept building, kept building, kept building, and I got a phone call one night, on my wife's birthday before we sat down for dinner, and it was Dan at AngelList, I hope he'd be comfortable telling the story, who I love. Incredible product mind and he led product over AngelList for startups. He said, "We're going to get out of incorporation. This is not going to be our focus going forward. Do you want the business?"

(02:12:28):
That was like a year and a half after they had really gone out, or maybe two years after they'd gone out, or something like this. I was like, "Wow." We had kept such an open relationship with them. We had paired with them on legal constructs. We had discussed 83(b) election openly. A lot of people were like, "I can't believe you're talking to the competitor." Look, we all share the same mission here. Yes, we're competing, but are we really all better off from treating each other at arm's distance? We had a shared Slack channel. We discussed when the Delaware was slow on incorporation. One time is because they were playing softball and they had an afternoon off. That's a real story, and we've discussed it. AngelList was incredible in how they evaluated it. We're evaluating different partners, but because of our working relationship and the quality of your product, and they saw we were going with 83(b) election and the intensity of that, they just put up a webpage that said to get started with AngelList, if you need a company, go right over to Atlas.

(02:13:36):
That was a really amazing moment because I respected them so much and I looked up to them so much that they would mutually beneficially choose to do that. And everybody was excited and happy, and customers are happy, and it's been an incredible relationship since, in which you can start on AngelList, go through Atlas, and then all of your information is automatically populated into AngelList automatically. We've since rolled that out with several other partners, Mercury, Carta, others, but AngelList really led the way there, and we maintain a great relationship with the team. It took a while, but it really reproved to me that they're not competitors. It's alternatives, and if you care about your customer, you care about their alternatives, and if you care about the mission, you need to all work together. Look, there's some friendly competition, of course. We all want to win, but in the long term, I think all parties are significantly better off.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:14:31):
Wow, that is an awesome story. I don't know if you've shared that anywhere else. There's so many lessons there that I could spin off on and... Not worrying about competition, staying heads down, just solving customer problems, staying close to your competition, not being afraid to talk to them, sharing advice with each other, just building the best possible product. I don't know, there's a ton there that's super interesting.

Jeff Weinstein (02:14:52):
I couldn't really draw it up any better, and I think the world is better off with more specialization, and it's a pain in the butt to do these incorporations. I think you want more specialization and more partnership, and I think a lot of companies are starting to do that now.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:15:12):
Let me go back to the lessons you shared on how to build something new at a big company, then we can wrap up. I took a bunch of notes here, and these are awesome and they actually resonate a lot with Mihika, who came on the podcast, who's at Figma, been the person building a lot of zero-to-one stuff. So it's nice that there's these trends that are coming up again and again.

(02:15:32):
One tip is storyboard the ideal. With a Sharpie, draw out, "Here's this exciting vision of what this could be if we were to pull it off without constraints." Unconstrained, powerful vision. Two is solve a burning use case. Make it clear this is a huge problem for a lot of people. There's probably stories you share there. Show tangible forward progress like, "Look at this, we made this progress, we made this progress. Sent ourselves a piece of blank paper. Look at this, it's a huge milestone." And have momentum, and Mihika talked about this. Keep the fire alive. Keep the fire alive, show momentum. We're making progress. This metrics moving up into the right. Then there's a milestone... Felt like you had an early milestone of like, "Look, we made progress," and then also, have the business case, basically. "Look how much we could make and look what this could be if we were to succeed." Anything you'd add there? Anything you'd correct?

Jeff Weinstein (02:16:22):
Bringing the earliest customers into the room with your team as soon as humanly possible. We would just invite a founder to the team meeting. We would pipe all their feedback into a Slack channel automatically. We have all the NPS scores going to a channel, and anytime it's not a 10 for 10, we follow up directly. Constant engagement with a customer creates the momentum where it doesn't need to be the product person or some other leader saying, "We need to do this. Follow me." It's, "Oh my gosh, the world needs this. Let's figure out how to do it even faster."

(02:17:06):
And a tip that the team has tried, and this is well since I've been involved day-to-day, is literally inviting customers in to design the product, which I'd actually never heard of. "Hey, we're thinking about what happens after incorporation now and what can we do to help founders after they've set up their company? What would be magical there?" We just invite founders in, into a Whimsical, a piece of software I love. It's a really easy learning curve to create visual diagrams. And rather than doing a UXR about it, we just say, "What would you hope this dashboard would have?" And they'd grab a thing, and they start typing, and they start drawing what they want their dashboard to be. Why were we guessing beforehand? I now scratch my head. I'm several years into a decade-plus building things and I was like, "I doing this by myself. Why didn't I just assign it to the people who are going to use it in the first place?"

(02:18:01):
Now look, that doesn't always work because not all of your customers are going to be product designers at heart, but more of them than you think, and I think it's giving your customers write access, and not just read access, to your company is incredibly powerful. I think I had not quite seen it so directly where you just actually designed what they want, but I saw a diagram of something we're working on right now. I was like, "Wow, we haven't even had design look at it." They're like, "No, actually the customer drew it." Great. Why were we guessing?

Lenny Rachitsky (02:18:35):
I think you have an unfair advantage where your customers are founders and oftentimes have product skills and design skills, but I love that [inaudible 02:18:43].

Jeff Weinstein (02:18:43):
It's true, but I will really push, because you don't need a hundred of them and you'll find somebody somewhere who knows. You just got to sit in a little more silence. They'll raise their hand.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:18:55):
There's a quote you shared somewhere that relates to what you just said that your dad once said, "You can screw up a sentence if it begins with 'The customer.'"

Jeff Weinstein (02:19:03):
That's true. Yeah, my dad runs an IT business in Baltimore to help other businesses with their computer systems. Growing up, I would literally, physically clean the keyboards of his employees and dust the mice. But yeah, he's very, very customer-oriented, where I get a lot of it from, and my mom's a painter, so I think there's some combination of talents or interests there. He would take it one step further, and he sometimes physically bring a chair over in a meeting and say, "The customer is sitting here," and you'd have to pretend. Then he would fake talk to the invisible customer. "Based on what you've seen today at the meeting..." I saw him do this one time. "Based on what you've seen today at the meeting, are you more likely to pay your bill or less likely to pay your bill based on what you witnessed?"

(02:19:55):
That's a little intense on the pantomime, but I think the point gets across that... Again, because it's so natural to think internal, if you begin the sentence physically with "The customer" then start your sentence, you just have a much better shot at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:20:09):
That's an amazing story. Very a study group-ish, like an early prototype. Jeff, we've covered so much ground. I have two hours more worth of questions, but we need to-

Jeff Weinstein (02:20:21):
Let's lock.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:20:22):
We need to cut it off, I think. Is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Jeff Weinstein (02:20:31):
Really excited about whatever you're building out there, thinking of building. My email address is incredibly easy to find. My Twitter handle is incredibly easy to find. Do not hesitate to send me cold emails. My love language is Loom videos of bugs, but feel free to send anything you have off the top of your head. I respond to good cold emails. Don't hesitate.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:20:51):
What's the email, real quick, for people?

Jeff Weinstein (02:20:53):
If finding my email address is your issue? It can't possibly be, but it is my first initial and last name at basically everything in the world, though my handle on Twitter is jeff_weinstein, but gosh, if you can't find my email address then you got a bigger problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:21:07):
Okay, we'll link to it in the show notes, as well. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? Here we go. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Jeff Weinstein (02:21:20):
I know a lot of people on this podcast recommend high-output management, but it should be swap the Bible out for it at all the hotels in the world, in the little drawer. Put it everywhere. You can't go wrong, though. It is an incredible clarity of how to spend your time as a leader, a manager of other people, a very high bar for how evaluating your work as the sum everyone around you. That was very clarifying to me that it's not an individual effort, it is the sum of everything I'm involved in is how to measure it. So that's definitely up there. A nice pair to that book, as a amuse-bouche afterwards, is Orbiting the Giant Hairball: A Corporate Fool's Guide to Surviving with Grace, I think, is the full exact title by Gordon MacKenzie, which is the story of a illustrator at Hallmark, the greeting card company, and it turns out to be a, again, bureaucratic, slow-moving organization that, over time, added rules and policies and rules and policies and quelled creativity and innovation, which is surprising at a greeting card company, but it existed. So this is his incredibly well-drawn book, as you'd imagine, with beautiful illustrations about how he orbited the hairball of the organization to inspire others, keep himself engaged, and to bring creativity and excitement and trying to pull people off the hairball as he orbited it. So I think it's a fun afternoon read with beautiful illustrations about how to stay sane at big companies and where to be a little goofy and take the advantage and gravity of the hairball, but not be succumbed by it and to be able to orbit it.

(02:23:22):
Those two are really fun. I will say one other one I like... Because we haven't talked about strategy here, there's been more getting stuff done and some other tactical things, but 7 Powers, and I know you had the author recently on, which was awesome. I won't explain the book, you just watch the podcast of it, but it walks through many of the business powers and moats a company can have. I ran into the author...

Lenny Rachitsky (02:23:55):
Hamilton Helmer.

Jeff Weinstein (02:23:56):
Hamilton Helmer, yes, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:23:57):
What a cool name.

Jeff Weinstein (02:23:58):
Very cool name. Alliterative. At the Box lunchroom one time, where I worked at Box, they acquired one of our companies, and I was like, "Any luck finding the eighth power?" He was like, "I'm looking, I'm looking," as he ran off with his sandwich. One other funny, somewhat embarrassing moment about that book is when I was applying to work at Stripe, I was in some email conversation with our CEO, Patrick Collison, who is quite well-read and enjoys books, and I was trying to showcase, " I like books a little bit," though not at any level of him. And I had mentioned I just finished reading 7 Powers, and I recommended it to him, but it joke's on me because he's quoted in the foreword that I had skipped. So he was very kind to let me know that he had read it and he is quoted in it, so I was like, "Oh shoot, maybe I won't get the job." But I got through that part, at least. So those books have spoken to me. Do you have a favorite power, by the way, Lenny? Do you have a favorite power?

Lenny Rachitsky (02:24:57):
His favorite power is counter-positioning. I also like that power a lot because I think it's the one you can that really changes everything about how you build your company, so that's the one that always stands out to me. How about you?

Jeff Weinstein (02:25:07):
I like counter-positioning also, and Atlas with going cheap and that audience is counter-positioning, but I really enjoy process, the process power, because it is very difficult to, as an organization, get good at anything, and if you could do that over a long period of time in a sustainable way, you have a power.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:25:26):
This is the nerdiest chat I've ever had. Which is your favorite 7th Power? I love it. But on that power, I asked him about it. He makes a really strong point there, that rarely is it actually a power for people. They think the way we execute is going to be our advantage and rarely is it actually a power. Usually people can copy it, but when you nail it...

Jeff Weinstein (02:25:47):
That's even better, because then if your competition thinks they have it-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:25:50):
Yeah, exactly.

Jeff Weinstein (02:25:51):
They won't invest than the other one. So I like it even more, for that reason.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:25:54):
I love it. But I was going to say with Patrick Collison being quoted in the book, not only was he wrote part of the forward or was quoted, he basically credited 7 Powers of helping build Stripe. No big deal.

Jeff Weinstein (02:26:07):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:26:08):
This lightning around is going great. This is a very microcosm of our whole chat so far. Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jeff Weinstein (02:26:17):
How To with John Wilson. It's on HBO. For those who haven't seen it, not really giving away anything because it's just wild when you watch it. You can't give it away. This videographer has found footage where he's just walking through Manhattan, and other parts of the country, but mostly New York, with a camera for 10 years, just filming intensely weird things. And if you've spent any time in New York, there's plenty to film. Then has put together this narrative afterwards about certain topics like how to make risotto or how to take out the trash or how to...

(02:26:53):
It's a way of seeing life through the eyes of these vignettes, diving down and really understanding people, and he does it through this incredibly dry humor of stitching together this video footage to tell a different narrative. And I think some of it is that we used to live in New York, and I love living in California, but I miss that frequency of strangeness, and you can see that through that TV show. Fantastic.

(02:27:26):
Movie? I recently watched The Quiet Girl, which is a film about a young Irish girl who is from a dysfunctional home and has this opportunity to live with a family friend who have more opportunity for her, more empathetic to her, and it showcases, again, how fragile things are. It's a very intense film, but there's something beautiful in how much opportunity was in front of this young girl. It is a tearjerker, but a great one.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:28:05):
Do you have a favorite product you have recently discovered that you love?

Jeff Weinstein (02:28:11):
I love my computer. I'm fast at my computer. Being fast at my computer helps me just go from intention to just out in the world. I've fallen back in love with Raycast, which is an automation tool for those who have watched the journey of Spotlight and Quicksilver and Alfred and all these automator services. Raycast seems to have cracked the nut on automation, nerd complexity, but also UI ease and some nice touches and loads quickly, does the basics. It's fully programmable, extensible, just a huge fan of Raycast. And then I think for product people, if you don't have CleanShot installed for screenshots, you're behind the curve. Being able to take a screenshot and blur particular things or point at stuff or have arrows and lines and have that be second nature, fast, instantaneous is so useful to be able to communicate what you're seeing. When I get a new laptop, it's Raycast first and CleanShot second.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:10):
Wow, I am going to download CleanShot immediately.

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:13):
Yes, it's extremely-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:15):
I've not heard of it. I've been using Skitch as my blurrings.

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:18):
As much as I appreciate the Skitch folks, CleanShot is an incredible piece of software.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:22):
Amazing. I'm going to do that. All right, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:30):
I don't even realize I say "Go Go Go" a lot, but I do. I actually say it and write it so people I hear that they'll later say, "Go Go Go" back to me. I'm like, "Huh? Don't I say that sometimes?" "Yes, you say it a lot." So apparently, "Go Go Go" is one of them. I also-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:45):
I love that.

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:46):
Say, "Let's make some mistakes," when we're brainstorming something or sitting at a sushi restaurant and talk sushi guy or gal, to showcase, "Let's be creative. Do whatever you want. No pretense. I'm not evaluating anything. Let's make some mistakes." It's just a weird thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:30:08):
They're so good. I'm going to use that for my podcast guests. "Let's just make some mistakes. Don't worry about it."

Jeff Weinstein (02:30:14):
At that point, everyone's like, "What? Okay, fine. Sure. Cool."

Lenny Rachitsky (02:30:17):
I like the combo of those two, "Go go go, let's just make some mistakes while we're going."

Jeff Weinstein (02:30:21):
You have to use it in certain circumstances and not for the five nines of reliability on our API, but it does have its place.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:30:29):
Final question. You worked with Patrick Collison and John Collison for many years. I'm curious what the most useful feedback or advice you have heard from them or learned from them?

Jeff Weinstein (02:30:40):
On my first month working here, which I guess is six, seven years ago now, they had put me in charge of our payments infrastructure services. That's all the backend systems that communicate with the financial system and all the internal APIs where we build the external APIs and products on top of, so quite a lot of stuff. I knew nothing about finance. I knew nothing about the scale that we're talking about. They entrusted me, somewhat insanely, with that responsibility. On the first month we had our quarterly business review where... The normal quarterly process, and I was like, "Okay, cool. I'll do the next one. I'll write the next one." I've been here one month. They're like, "No, you write it. It'll be even better that you write it." It's like, oh my God. It's forcing me to have to, in the fourth week, have that catalyst to understand the whole business and with the permission, because I was going to have to write this doc about how we're doing. The company had been in existence for seven years before I got here. It was already at some reasonable scale.

(02:31:54):
It was an intense operation, and I remember writing the first draft and sending it to him because it was... I didn't want to send... He had pushed me to do it a bit, and I figured I'd give him an early draft and he wrote back, "This doesn't sound like you yet." The willingness to entrust a new person to provide their own perspective and bring it into a very formalized document like that was an impressive... That really spoke to me, and I rewrote it completely, and I made it sound like me, and I've tried to make things sound like me since.

(02:32:29):
John's is more of a gut punch, I'll say. I reported to John, the co-founder. Maybe nine months into reporting to him, I would run around with a clipboard. I was a little bit manic of getting a lot done. A lot going on at Stripe at the time. We'd have a one-hour one-on-one, I'd be listing all of the things that we had accomplished and the problems we have and where we need escalation help and where we're stuck and all this that and the other. Lots of stuff. I had checklists and physical paper, flipping it over a little bit frantically. And he said, "You are one of the best people I've ever worked with at solving problems three through 100, but I need you stuck on problems one and two."

(02:33:22):
Oh man, that hurt. I was like, "Oh, shoot." I am productive on the non-hardest problems and I was trying to mask, not on purpose mask, but who wants to be stuck on something so hard when there's so much else to do? From then on, I would show up to him with problems one and two and not talk about problems three through 100. Even if we were working on them, we would just not talk about them and we would get stuck on problems one and two. That was phenomenal advice, which I was like, "Oh, shoot, I'm going to be fired." But it was really a deeply impactful sentence.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:03):
Wow, what a powerful, great, helpful... That's great advice [inaudible 02:34:10] right there.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:10):
He really looked my soul and-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:12):
Yeah, I love this.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:13):
Like a street fighter style or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:16):
But to your point, very impactful and helpful.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:18):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:20):
Jeff, we did it. The archeology is complete.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:23):
I appreciate the time, Lenny. It was fun. I don't do too many of these, so I'm curious to people's feedback and really appreciate the questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:30):
Amazing. Jeff, thank you so much for being here.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:33):
Appreciate it, Lenny.

# The ultimate guide to founder-led sales | Jen Abel (co-founder of JJELLYFISH)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I've always wanted to create a very tactical episode on how to do sales, especially with a focus on founder led sales.

Jen Abel (00:00:06):
A lot of early stage founders get tripped up as they're taking late stage sales advice. The founder is the product. You have studied. You have experienced something that most of the market hasn't even had a chance to maybe see or visualize yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
A billion SaaS tools emailing me constantly about their product. How do you get someone to even want to talk to you and be open to learning about what you're doing?

Jen Abel (00:00:25):
So if you can focus the messaging in a way that speaks to something that is a bit of shock value or is counterintuitive, you'll get them to continue reading. When a problem is truly being felt by the market, people will get on a call, people will respond.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
The next step I imagine is you're on the phone with them trying to convince them to actually care. What do you do there? How do you get them to engage further?

Jen Abel (00:00:45):
You need to be vulnerable. I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We have a lot to learn. Can we kind of gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side? Founder led sales is not about revenue on day one. It is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse, so that you can earn the right to sell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today my guest is Jen Abel. Jen is the co-founder of Jellyfish, where her and her team help early stage founders learn how to sell, do early customer discovery, and set up a repeatable sales motion. Prior to Jellyfish, Jen was an enterprise sales director at the Muse and a general assembly, and she's obsessed with helping founders in the zero to one stage of their journey. In our conversation, we get extremely tactical and in the weeds on how to actually do sales as a founder. We talk through each step of the sales process, and Jen shares what you should be doing and saying at every step. We go through how to find your first set of leads, how to reach out to them, what to say in your message, how to structure your first sales call, how to get through procurement, and how to get that final signature.

(00:01:55):
She shares actual words you should be using, and phrases and structures, and pitfalls that most people run into at each of these steps. I've never heard a podcast episode with this much advice that you can put into practice tomorrow, and I am very excited to hear how it goes for you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jen Abel.

(00:02:24):
Jen, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Jen Abel (00:02:27):
Thanks, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:28):
What I've always wanted to do is to create a very tactical episode on how to do sales, like how to actually have sales conversations, how to find leads, how to close deals. Especially with a focus on founder led sales, where founders are doing the early sales versus hiring salesperson. Which one, I know you're a huge advocate of and we'll talk about this. And two, you basically spent all your time working with founders and founding teams, helping them learn how to do sales, how to set up their go-to-market motions, how to scale teams, sales teams, how to hire sales people. So I'm very excited to have you here to create a very in the weeds, hands-on episode on how to do sales. How does that sound broadly?

Jen Abel (00:03:07):
That sounds awesome, and thank you so much for having me, Lenny. I mean, it's a true pleasure to be here with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:12):
It's my pleasure. Many people have recommended you come on this podcast. I'm excited we're doing this. Let me start with just this kind of question, our founder led sales. Maybe just briefly explain what that term means and then talk about why this is so important, why this is the way you recommend companies start doing sales?

Jen Abel (00:03:29):
Founder led sales is really that first milestone that a startup goes through on the commercial side, which is, how do I go out and get my first few customers? Some people might say zero to one, which is, how do I get my first million? Others might say, how do I go out and get my first 10 customers? It's all kind of in the same vein. And founder led sales is really, really, really important because in the very, very, very early days, when there is no brand equity, when there is no marketing engine running, when there is limited to no reference ability, the founder is the product, right? Because the product is still, could be abstract, could be an MVP or in it's really early formation. So the founder is the product. When people say, well, what does that even mean? It means that you are a subject matter expert on something highly specific.

(00:04:23):
You have studied, you have experienced something that most of the market hasn't even had a chance to maybe see or visualize yet. So you have this novel insight that you are building a business around. And it's that novel insight and the way you see the world that gets the market excited, in absence of a product. And that's actually happens even before you even show the product. So founder led sales is how do you bring the founders vision into the world and have the market, and understand what part of the market accepts it, and then what part of that vision are they accepting? So it's aligning the founders vision with the market reality.

(00:06:50):
And this is counter to what many founders hope is, I'm just going to hire a salesperson, they'll handle sales. I'll build the thing, I'll wait for them to find deals. And this is like a lot of people think this way. And founder led sales is the movement of just like, no, no, you should be doing the sales for a long time as a founder.

Jen Abel (00:07:06):
Absolutely. I mean, it is the competitive advantage. I don't think people realize how much of a competitive advantage the founder led sales motion is, for three specific reasons. One is that the founder is the visionary. No one's going to be able to speak to it like they can. No salesperson, really no non-founder. The second is that they are the highest order in the hierarchy of the startup. It's the founder. So the market is excited to talk to a founder because they usually know something that the market doesn't know. And they want to learn and maybe they want to experience something differently. So being able to speak to the person that's running the vision, speak to the person that's crafted the vision.

(00:07:50):
And then that third piece is that the founder can see something budding in a conversation that a salesperson won't be able to see. And it's those budding moments that's where all the gold lives. And I don't think a lot of founders realize that. Their day one market vision is never the same vision that takes them in a product market fit. And I say that all the time. It's these little budding moments where it's like I was able to get to that budding insight because I went deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper through these calls and these conversations, to fully refine how we want to go out and sell it. And only a founder is going to be able to see those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:26):
I love this because this connects really well with an episode I just did with the CMO of Wiz. And the founders went through this exactly. They had 10 to 15 conversations a day for weeks, and then they're like realizing people keep telling us they like it, but no one's buying, no one's excited enough to want to actually move forward. And that was only happening because the founders were on these calls.

Jen Abel (00:08:49):
Yeah, I mean, the other thing too is that it becomes a game of telephone. It's like, hey, this salesperson says that no cares about this. What do you think the first thing the founder's going to say is? It's the salesperson. So much easier to say that than, is it me? Is it my vision? So it also kind of brings the accountability closer to the pulse where decisions are made.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):
It's interesting how similar this is to product building, where there's this idea that a founder top down can tell the team what to build, and it's this very waterfall cycle. When in reality the idea of the product and feature is just like step one, and then there's actually building it, testing it, talking to customers about it, that actually turns that initial seed of an idea to the real thing that people will want.

Jen Abel (00:09:33):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:34):
Okay. So the catch 22, I don't know if that's the term here. The challenge is, okay, so great, founders should be doing sales. Most founders have never done sales. They just want to build product. They're mostly product people, design people. Sometimes there's founders that are salespeople. Rarely is that the case in my experience. So doing sales is very hard, not something that comes naturally to a lot of people. A lot of people are very afraid of it. So with that, let's get into how to actually get better at the sales process. I think a nice framework for how we can go through this is basically first let's talk about the sales cycle, the steps, the key steps of a sales cycle. And then we'll just go through each step and help people learn some tactics to get through each of those conversations.

Jen Abel (00:09:35):
Sounds great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):
Okay. Yeah. Cool. So what's the simplest way to think about the steps of a sales cycle?

Jen Abel (00:10:26):
The traditional sales stages that most CRMs are even set up as is you have your intro call. You have your second call, which sometimes could be the demo depending on the stage of market you're selling to. Then you have your third call, which is going to be more about walking through a proposal, a scope of work, maybe going deeper into the demo to contextualize it to everything you've learned. The fourth call is going to be getting their feedback and kind of co-authoring that scope of work even further. The fifth call is going to be around probably an introduction to procurement. And then selling into procurement in itself, it's its own little sales cycle, but we could talk about that in a sec. And then post-procurement, it's going to be obviously getting that signature and knowing who the actual signatory is. Sometimes it's not even the business unit, it's sometimes legal, CFO, procurement themselves. So just understanding who that is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):
Okay, great. So let's walk through each of these steps. So I love that each call has its traditional goal, demo, proposal, then co-authoring, and then procurement, and then post-procurement. I love how consistent everybody is.

Jen Abel (00:11:39):
Yeah, well, it's also, it's interesting because it's also predicated on their buying process as well. So if they're really used to buying, if they're very mature in their buying process, they actually might guide you to what the steps are. But most startups are turning non-consumers into consumers. So that's why this kind of fits well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
Got it. So there's this intra call step. So kind starting about where it begins. I think where a lot of people struggle most is getting anyone to even pay attention. You don't want to talk to them. A billion SaaS tools emailing me constantly about their product. So maybe we start there of just like how do you get someone to even want to talk to you and be open to learning about what you're doing?

Jen Abel (00:12:19):
Yeah. And this is why that founder led sales piece is so important. One is when it's coming from the founder, it's an entirely different weight. You're like, oh, interesting. This founder is reaching out to me. Okay, I'm going to seek to go a layer deeper, knowing who is sending me this note. The second piece is this is why that novel insight, that technical insight, that business model insight that you've uncovered needs to lead here. People are inspired by a new way of thinking, usually something counterintuitive, something that's really different. I really try and stay away from better, because that's really hard to define, and better means something different to everyone. So if you can focus the messaging in a way that speaks to something that has a bit of shock value, or is counterintuitive, you'll get them to continue reading. So first and foremost, I usually like to open it with, which is why is this relevant for me in my role?

(00:13:20):
Why are you reaching out to me? So first and foremost is relevancy. I think that matters even more so than personalization right now. I think it's so easy to personalize anything, and it can also come across as really stressed when you're like, hey, I noticed you were on such and such podcast, and that was when they were previously two roles behind. So I always say relevancy. If you can get to relevancy, that's the most important piece. The second most important piece is really getting to that level of differentiation or counterintuitive nature. So say something that would literally make them say what? Or that makes no sense. Maybe not that makes no sense, but what or how could that be? Or I've never thought about it that way. Or I actually don't fully understand what they're saying, but there's something there that's interesting. Get them to pause for a minute.

(00:14:13):
And the most important piece is getting this done where, if they get it on their mobile phone, which everyone is looking at their mobile phone and on email, they don't have to scroll. So usually three to four sentences max. That also, that's how a founder writes. That's how an executive writes if you're selling top down. But most importantly, leave them wanting more. Don't say everything, don't even talk about the solution. Talk about the problem that you want to solve, and why it needs to be solved or why it's not good enough today. So those are the four main components. Just to reiterate, relevancy, bring some level of counterintuitive or really different approach to the conversation, focusing in on a problem that's predicated to them, and really concise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
I love this. Is there an example you could share that helps make this even more real? Maybe an email you helped with. And by the way, this is email and LinkedIn, I imagine is where you're communicating mostly?

Jen Abel (00:15:11):
LinkedIn, email, you would be shocked to hear this, but cold calling. I never used to do this. It is one of the most... The interest rates on cold calling are a lot higher than email in many cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:26):
So it's calling, email, cold email and LinkedIn DMs, is that the three channels generally?

Jen Abel (00:15:31):
Yep, those are the three, yeah, the main ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):
Cool. Yeah. Is there an example? It doesn't have to be word for word which you've done or people done, but just how do you... Yeah.

Jen Abel (00:15:38):
Actually our first three years were built on cold email before we actually had clients, before we got word of mouth from the founders we worked with, I cold emailed the first 20 customers we had at Jellyfish. And the line I used in there was zero to one sales talent doesn't exist. That's why I want to have a conversation with you. So that was kind of that leading, wait, what? What does that even mean? And what I would do is tie that to them in some respects. If they recently raised the seed or series A, where they are in that journey. But I would lead with that and then tie it into like, hey, I noticed you're looking to target X, Y, and Z based off of what your website. I'd love to have a conversation with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:25):
And that first piece is the relevance. Here's why this is relevant to you.

Jen Abel (00:16:28):
Yeah. And then I say, our belief at Jellyfish is zero to one sales talent doesn't exist. That's why we built this model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):
Awesome. And you kept it really short. So it's relevance, counterintuitive, keep it really short. And then what was the fourth piece?

Jen Abel (00:16:42):
The fourth piece is just make sure it's concise so that you don't have to scroll on mobile phone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:47):
While we're on this topic. What's a good conversion rate of these sorts of cold outreaches?

Jen Abel (00:16:51):
Conversion rate is interesting. Because everyone's so focused on conversion rate. I get that in the beginning until you have some wins, you have to focus there. But I just want to reverse engineer it backwards a bit. Once you kind of have this, and I'll talk about it in a sec, which is win rate. Win rate is if I got Lenny on a phone call, and he went through the sales process, and I signed him up. And I spoke to 10 Lenny's and only Lenny R was the one that signed. That's one out of 10, that's a 10% win rate.

(00:17:23):
So if you have a really high win rate, let's say 30 or 40%, you actually don't need as high of a conversion rate on the outbound, because you know if you get someone in the funnel, the throughput is very healthy. If your win rate is really low, you need that conversion rate to be much, much higher, because you need more and more and more at bats. So conversion rate is a funny thing. In the beginning I get it because you don't have a lot of customers going through the pipeline yet. But there's people focus on it in a little bit of a false sense because interest rate truly is also dictated by win rate. So I just want to specify that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:03):
That's a really good point.

Jen Abel (00:18:05):
I would say if you're doing a win rate around 15 to 30% and you need to carry, oh I don't know, a million dollar quota. I would say a healthy conversion rate from outbound probably sits around, when it's mature, around five to 7%. Sometimes it could be two to 3%. Sometimes I've seen eight to 15% because it's coming from the founder, and they're solving a really heartfelt problem. So interest rate is also predicated on the problem that the founder has decided they want to solve for, and their insight on that problem.

(00:18:51):
And everyone wants to keep going back to, well, email rate is really low, email doesn't work anymore. LinkedIn, I'm not getting the connects I want. Yes, you can argue that the game has changed a little bit, but when a problem is truly being felt by the market, people will get on a call. People will respond. And if I can compare two engagements at a time that we're running, I see one where it's a 2% interested rate and then I'm seeing another one that's actually at 12% interested rate. And we're doing nothing different. The only thing that's different is the insight that the founder has on the market, which is a hard pill to swallow. And I know that's hard to hear too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:32):
And those are two different companies selling different things?

Jen Abel (00:19:34):
Two different companies selling to two different markets, but they're not fundamentally drastically different markets.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:43):
Got it. But one's basically got more product market fit essentially?

Jen Abel (00:19:46):
That's exactly right. So everyone always comes back to we have the sales problem, we have the sales problem, we have an outbound problem. And yes, there could be some technical things going on that you need to look at. Maybe you leveraged clay and you blasted a thousand people and now your domain health has been impacted. But the vast majority of the time, maybe you're just not saying anything interesting at all. Maybe the problem you're looking to solve just isn't widely felt. Maybe the perspective you have needs another level of refinement because you're just not getting those bites.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
I feel like this question you just touched on is something a lot of founders are always wondering, is this product not the thing people want? Is it my sales skills? I guess I imagine this is a very difficult question to answer, especially quickly. I guess is there anything there that's more likely because of this, it means your product isn't something anyone's want, versus you're not doing a good job selling it?

Jen Abel (00:20:41):
Remember that amazing chart you drew where it talked about the length of time it took? I think you picked the top 25 startups.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:50):
For product market fit timeline [inaudible 00:20:51].

Jen Abel (00:20:51):
Product market fit. Yeah, that amazing image that I think has been reshared more times than anything I've ever seen. It's interesting because if you look at, I was looking at this closely the other day. If you look at the top section where the time to product market fit is consolidated, and you go all the way down to the air tables and the figmas, which a long time to get to product market fit. If you think about the earlier ones, which were, it was like GitHub that had product market fit pretty quickly. The SOC 2 compliant company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
Vanta.

Jen Abel (00:21:23):
Vanta. There's this thing in my head and I haven't fully validated it but I'm going to share it with you, which is did they start with the market problem first and then build the product? Because they knew who their market was right off the bat. Versus an air table and a figma that I think started with a technical insight and then were trying to find their market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:46):
I think that's absolutely right. Vanta, the way they approached it, Christina, she was searching for a pain. She was obsessed with talking to everybody about a pain that they needed solved, and then she just built it in spreadsheets. So she started with the market very much so.

Jen Abel (00:22:00):
And I think product market fit when you start with the market first, it's accelerated. But I will say this, I think that it's also capped on the upside. Because you're starting with the market versus the air table and the figma, which started with the technical insight and has uncapped upside. But one is certainly riskier than the other. Starting with a product is a hell of a lot riskier. And this is where I come back to so many people will say, how did you get funding and not know who your market is? And it's like, because if they do find it, that's a really, really, really big win. Versus I think if you start with the market first, you could potentially get a good win but is it more capped?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:47):
Interesting.

Jen Abel (00:22:48):
I don't know, it's just a thought. I was staring at your grid for so long, I was like, there's something here. And I kept coming back to those were more like I kept breaking it down to market versus product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:01):
Yeah, I love this. I think there's definitely something there. There's also horizontal versus a very specific problem you're solving.

Jen Abel (00:23:06):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:07):
Okay, so you mentioned clay and you kind of nerd sniped me there of just what tools do you find useful? And it makes me think about finding leads, which is kind of going backwards through the sales process, but it might be okay, so maybe let's spend time there. Just like what do you recommend to founders to find the good leads? Glengarry Glen Ross good leads.

Jen Abel (00:23:28):
So I say before you buy any tool, don't even think about tools. I feel like people turn everything into this complicated mess with all of the tools that they start integrating. And then they're engineers, I get it. So now they start to engineer these sales tools together and then they blast their market, and now they have 5,000 notes out in one day and their domain takes a hit. So I think before you even overthink about the tools right now, can you manually find 30 people that you want to spend 15 to 20 minutes writing a rock solid note to? Are there 30 people that you are deeply excited to learn from, that you are willing to invest 15 to 20 minutes to write a really thoughtful note? Let's just start there. So some questions. One, are they even discoverable? How hard is it to find 30 people?

(00:24:21):
What have you noticed across those 30 people? Are there any interesting insights? Maybe it's the size of the team they work on, maybe it's the industry they're in, maybe it's the length of time they've been in their role, maybe it's their previous roles in their career. Are there some commonalities? There's always some level of a commonality usually in most cases. Okay, so now you're starting to collect some parameters. Just by doing this exercise, you're starting to collect some parameters around who you want to learn from and sell to. Now if you send out those 30 notes and you wrote them specifically, and you spend good quality of time on it. And you've hit them on email, you've hit them on LinkedIn, maybe even tried to call them, maybe you've sent them a Twitter DM, pulled out all the stops. How many people respond? 1, 5, 0?

(00:25:15):
If it's zero, it begs the question, do you now want to do another 30 in a very similar fashion? Do you want to change the messaging a little bit? Now it forces these natural experiments. Or do you want to maybe go after a different role? So it forces you to answer these questions in a very manual way before you even think about integrating and spending time on tools. And then you get to a point where it's like, okay, now I'm starting to get some learnings and now I've realized, okay, it's this group of people, I've spoken to maybe two or three, now I want to go out and actually build a campaign to now talk to the next 10 to 15 people in that group. Truncate this as much as you can because I think people focus so much on volume in the beginning.

(00:26:06):
Even if you're selling down market, mid market, enterprise, volume comes once you've identified it and know the parameters. Parameters then allow you to do really strong enrichment with a clay. You now know the types of questions to give it. If you're not asking it the right questions, these enrichment tools, these sales tools will yield nothing. So it all comes back to even before you start your sales call, you need to make sure you're asking the right questions with am I even engaging, or do the people that I want to learn from or sell to, am I even messaging them in the right way? Are they even the right person? And the only way you can do that is by actually truncating these little experiments.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:49):
I love how tactical that is. And what I love is even one of your nuances you mentioned is can you even find them? This gives you a signal of how are... You're going to have to have hundreds of these, thousands of these eventually. If 30 is hard or impossible, you're in trouble already.

Jen Abel (00:27:06):
Totally. And it was funny, I was talking to someone today that said they had a target segment of high net worth individuals that they wanted to go out and serve. I'm like, how do you find those people? I guess when you get to a certain level, your net worth may be public. I don't know. That stuff's very hard to have certain parameters that are undiscoverable. And then if they're undiscoverable and it requires you getting on a call to understand if they are a fit, that does impact conversion rates. Not necessarily in a bad way, but now you need to kind of bring that back into the math equation, which is like, okay, if I speak to 10 people, I know two out of these 10 will be qualified. But I don't know which of those two out of 10. Well, that means you probably need more of those numbers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):
So to quickly recap a few of the key things that I've written down as we're talking. So if you're just trying to figure out who to reach out to, make a list of 30 potential prospects that you think are good fits, that would be excited about what you're building. Spend 15 to 30 minutes writing them each an email. Do these emails have to be really short the way you described previously?

Jen Abel (00:28:12):
I would say the shorter the better, but would you respond to that? If you got this email, would you respond it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:17):
Got it.

Jen Abel (00:28:17):
One of a great little tactical test is on Gmail, you can highlight the message and then have it replay it back to you from an audio perspective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):
Oh wow.

Jen Abel (00:28:28):
You'd be shocked how many notes I've changed when it replays it back and I'm like, oh, that sounds really passive-aggressive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:34):
Interesting. And so you also shared the structure for how to reach out to folks. So let me just share that again. And that applies to this initial email too, but it sounds like as you automate, you want to make it more precise and focused and not... Basically they're not as customized as you start reaching out to more folks.

Jen Abel (00:28:53):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:54):
So start with something, here's why this is relevant to you. You're looking for salespeople in this market. Here's something that's unexpected or surprised, like zero to one salespeople don't exist. Keep it short and then I always forget the last one.

Jen Abel (00:29:14):
Focus on the problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:16):
Focus on the problem.

Jen Abel (00:29:17):
You don't even need to talk about the solution. That's the big takeaway, which is if you get any sales email, you get what's the primary focus of that email? It's usually like here's what we do. But I bet if someone reached out to you with a novel insight and said, I'm really passionate about solving this problem, if it's something you're focused on, you'd probably reply.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:39):
If it's a big problem. If it's like, oh yeah, you're so right, I need this.

Jen Abel (00:29:42):
The beauty with the American market, and I say this because we do a little bit of work with international startups too, is if something doesn't feel right, people love to complain about it. And it's like use that to your advantage. Get that intel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:54):
A note that I just looked at, that I wrote down, that I think is very important is avoid using "this is better" as your pitch.

Jen Abel (00:30:01):
Yeah, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:02):
Different. Here's something shocking about what we're doing. Here's something that'll surprise you.

Jen Abel (00:30:07):
Yeah, or counterintuitive. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:08):
Counterintuitive.

Jen Abel (00:30:09):
Yeah, it's interesting. I spoke to a good friend that leads procurement at a massive organization. And he said to me, he goes, "One of the worst things someone can say to me is we're better than X product. Then I ask them to define that. And then I ask them, okay, how do we measure that? And then I say, okay, should we give this company another year to give them this feedback before we make this huge transition and disrupt momentum?" Yeah, better is a dangerous place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:40):
I invest in a bunch of startups and I find it's impossible to get anyone to care if things are good enough with what they got today. I'm happy not using the best possible product if my life is okay. And I have so many other things I got to do, I'll just deal with this good enough solution for now.

Jen Abel (00:30:57):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):
Okay, amazing. So we talked about how to figure out who to go after, how to pitch them to get them to want to talk. The next step I imagine is you're on the phone with them trying to convince them to actually care. What do you do there? How do you get them to engage further?

Jen Abel (00:31:15):
One is you need to be vulnerable. You're an early stage startup, okay. The market, we're at a point now where the market is smart. I always assume that the buyer I'm speaking to is highly educated and knows way more than I do. So just have that perception because what I've learned is a lot of the market will play dumb, and you can get yourself caught pretty quickly. So when you speak to them, I would be very open and honest with where you are. Hey, I'm an early stage startup. We are deeply passionate about solving this specific problem. We have a lot to learn. Here's how we are thinking about it from a problem priority perspective. Can we gain your insight into how this problem is manifesting on your side? And then let them open up. Now you have them one, talking about the problem. Now you're getting the intel about their perception of the problem, and is it even a problem? When you say you're early stage and there's still a lot to be done, it is easier to be honest.

(00:32:20):
If you tell them you have a fully baked, ready to go product, they're not going to give you honest feedback. It's very hard to say to a founder and look them in the eyes and say, hey, we built this product, can I show you what it is? You're just going to get someone that's going to say, oh, this is great, this is wonderful. But when you're vulnerable and when you tell them it's not fully built yet, even if it is, you will get more raw and honest feedback. Because it is easier to tell someone, hey, before you make this mistake, I actually don't care about that. If you've already built it, they're not going to give you that feedback. So the further you suggest you are, you're actually going to hamstring a lot of the intel, hamstring yourself on gaining a lot of the intel. So that's one counterintuitive thing that I think a lot of founders don't realize.

(00:34:14):
So I had April Dunford on the podcast a while ago. I don't know if-

Jen Abel (00:34:17):
She's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:18):
Amazing. And her last book, it actually has the opposite advice, but I think I know why, which is she focuses on later stage companies and her advice is the buyer. She has this really interesting insight that it's harder to buy software now than to sell it, because there's so much to consider and your job is on the line if you make a mistake. It's easier just to be like, forget it, I'm just going to go with what we have today. I don't want to put my ass on the line for buying this new thing that someone's trying. And so her advice is you actually have to educate the buyer on the market and here's what's happening. Here's where things are going, and here's why I think this is the future. But I think again, I think that's focusing on later stage stuff.

Jen Abel (00:34:55):
A hundred percent. And you raised such a good point, Lenny, which is late stage sales and early stage sales are very, very different. And I think that's where a lot of early stage founders get tripped up as they're taking late stage sales advice, usually coming from an investor. Or they've maybe hired a salesperson that's focused on more mature sales. But I think she's spot on. Buying is just as hard, if not harder, than selling right now. Because who wants to make a mistake and also who wants to go through switching costs? Oh, it's so painful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:30):
Yeah. I think the other really important point here that you're making is that part of this initial sales experience of founder led sales is not sell as much as you can. It's to learn what people want. And so I love that you're sharing here's how to get the best possible feedback, not necessarily close the most deals.

Jen Abel (00:35:47):
Totally. And founder led sales is not about revenue on day one. It is about learning as fast as humanly possible to get to that pulse, so that you can earn the right to sell. There's this concept that I talk about, which is you're going out to run sales to collect the research, which is what founder led sales is. And then you have sales for revenue, which is that post founder led sales stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):
And your milestone that you suggested of how far to take founder led sales, you said around a million ARR, right?

Jen Abel (00:36:20):
Yeah. I think it's about, some people say 500, some people say a million. I think if you get to 500K really, really fast, then I think absolutely you can move out of it. If you get to 500K really, really, really slow, you might not want to get out of it right away. You haven't reached that velocity point yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:41):
Awesome. I have a post that we'll link to that has actually numbers and when all these big startups move from founder led sales. It's in that same series about product market fit. There's two stories this makes me think of I'll share real quick. One is Sprig. They shared a story of first round capital at their first round and their partner there is just like, we will not let you hire a salesperson until you hit a million ARR. We're going to help you. We're going to have salespeople helping you through it, but we're not going to let you hire someone. And he was really happy about that. The other is Zip, which just raised a $2.3 billion valuation, a procurement company that I was lucky to be an investor in. And their first founder led sales motion was they just reached out on LinkedIn to heads of procurement, and just leaned into what you're saving more, which is we just want your advice on this product that we're building. Just tell us what problems you have. It was very advice oriented versus we want to sell you this thing.

Jen Abel (00:37:33):
Yeah, no, absolutely. I have this theory that maybe you shouldn't hire any salespeople until series A, right? Because seed is all about experimentation and proving out that experiment, and then obviously series A is about exploiting that learning. But I see so many people, I mean hiring for early stage sales is the odds are actually more against you than trying to get your next round of funding. Because it's truly, truly such a counterintuitive stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:08):
Interesting. Okay, so I kind of took us on a whole tangent. You were sharing advice on how to get someone excited. So the first is when you're engaging, you're talking to the prospect and company ABC. Your advice is be very honest and vulnerable about your stage. Tell them you're early stage. You're building this thing. You're deeply passionate about this problem. Here's what we're trying to do, here's our priority problem perspective, and where we're focusing, and kind of get their feedback on your approach. Cool. You were going to go to the next tip and I took us off course.

Jen Abel (00:38:44):
Testing the questions to ask. Where is that aha unlock for you? But more importantly, where's that aha moment unlocked for them? Because when they start getting their gears churning in their head about, and this is the beauty about not having a product and not showing them anything, they're visualizing in their head now. This is a really powerful thing, which is like, so tell me how this looks in your head? How are you seeing this? And they're like, I don't know if I can see it. And I'm like, great, we'll show you that. Great insight to know by the way. Or so I think this is how, I guess this is how it would work. Walk me through what's living in your head right now. You pick up on so much and then all of a sudden they're like, wait a second, we've tried solving for this and it's still not solved for. Or you know what? We hired someone last year to manage this. Great understanding. Is it being measured? Is it being managed and have they tried to solve for it? The leading indicators that you're onto something here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:44):
I love this thread because this is what everyone's always like, how do I know if I product market fit? There's these signals that you're talking about of signs that there's something here. Like a big enough pain point where they're excited to basically they want to pay for it, they will pay to solve a problem. So maybe just again, say the things you notice that are signs like, okay, you have something here.

Jen Abel (00:40:03):
So I think the first is it has to be a growing and widening problem. No one's going to spend time fixing a pretty fixed problem, because it's not necessarily really a priority anymore. It's maybe a pain in the butt, but it's not a priority if it's not growing or widening. So gate check one is like, what is the implication? Are you measuring? Are you managing this problem today? Yes or no? If they don't know, great to know. If they said no, okay, move on to the next. That's pretty powerful. No, we're not measuring or managing this. Okay, there's probably not much there. If it is being measured or managed, then the next question you want to get into is how have you tried to solve for it? Is it through that head count that you just hired? Is it through another tool? Is it just still an open gap because nothing exists yet to solve it? Just understand their maturity around how they've tried to plug it. These are all that make the secret moments in intel to close that gap.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):
That's awesome. And essentially it's showing you that there's a pain here that they're paying attention to and are trying to solve.

Jen Abel (00:41:14):
And what you're psychologically doing is now you're flipping them into a buyer where they're like, wait a second, hold on. I need to bring on so-and-so on the next call, they also think that this is not good enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):
That's funny because that's exactly what Wiz noticed, is they moved from people being like, oh, this is cool. I like it, I like it. To, okay, I'm going to pull in this person. I'm going to pull in this person to talk about it and make sure we're... And they were pulling in other people exactly as you described it, because they wanted to move forward on this thing.

Jen Abel (00:41:44):
Absolutely. And that's when you know there's some momentum behind it, which is when they're bringing in other colleagues. Whether it be the potential users, if you're reaching out to the executive, or the users like, hey, I actually want to bring my boss on to the next call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:57):
Good sign. Cool. Anything else along these lines of how to get someone excited slash understand if there's going to be pull there?

Jen Abel (00:42:04):
I guess the one thing is please, please, please do not ask questions like what keeps you up at night? If you had a magic wand, what are your pain points today? I can guarantee you that answer changes every single day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:19):
That's super interesting. Is there any tip for how to end one of these calls, as someone that's never done sales is like-

Jen Abel (00:42:23):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:24):
Okay.

Jen Abel (00:42:25):
Get the second call booked on the first call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:28):
Love it.

Jen Abel (00:42:28):
Pull up calendars. Look at calendars. Who else should be invited? It's just a natural evolution to ending the call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:35):
Great. So that's in 30 minutes though, right?

Jen Abel (00:42:38):
And if they say, ah, I'll email you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:42):
I could say.

Jen Abel (00:42:44):
That's also kind of a leading indicator. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):
So do you recommend not getting off the call, trying to avoid that, or is it just-

Jen Abel (00:42:50):
If they won't give you time on the calendar, you could say, listen, great. Feel free to email me. Maybe they're just being honest and they don't have their calendar available, but nine times out of 10, it's usually I don't have the heart to tell you I'm not interested.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to tell people you're not interested. Very cool. Okay. This is amazing. Okay, so the next step, if I remember correctly, is kind of co-authoring and co...

Jen Abel (00:43:13):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:14):
Okay, cool. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:43:16):
In the early, early days, one of the biggest ways you can get folks excited is it feels like it's going to be built specifically for them. The power of specificity, the power of being extremely focused. With that, you can literally turn a customer into a guide by asking them to co-author the scope. The scope of work. The co-authorship piece is important for two reasons. It helps you understand where they're on their biomaturity. Let me explain. If they do not have an existing process or strategy to solve X problem, they can't buy a technology yet, which means you need to sell them. And this is why I go back to you need to sell them some form of a service, right? Why? You want to be the one in there educating. You also want to get the logo. You also want to show the revenue. While it's not recurring revenue, it still shows intent.

(00:44:13):
And I think that that's really important. Every founder I speak to is like, well, my investor really doesn't want service-based revenue. That's fine. But then you can also tell your investor, great, should I wait 18 months to when they're ready to buy a solution, and be the one that's not the one selling them because someone else educated them? These are all of the implications of waiting. So yes, is service-based revenue great? No, we all know why it's not great. But it's great in the sense that it shows intent. It's great in the sense that you can call them a customer. It's great in the sense that now you can use their logo. And it's great in the sense because you are getting paid to educate them. You are getting paid to help them design their process. This is where all the power lives. And this is why so many AI startups a year and two years ago were going in on services contracts, because they wanted to set the mindset with the buyer around what this would look like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):
Is there anything you recommend to time box contain the services piece? Because I know a lot of companies-

Jen Abel (00:45:12):
Yes, such a great point, Lenny. You absolutely need to time box this. I would time box it as 90 days and then what you can say in the next 90 days, we'll scope where we are and what you need. Scoping out more than 90 days, listen, so much is going to change. You might also not want to do it anymore, so you don't want to lock yourself up. So I would look at 90 day increments. A specific example. We had a founder that my colleague was working with, and they were selling a very specific technology to a non-traditional... Sorry, a very traditional industry. I don't want to be two bleeding with what it is, but a very traditional industry that's not used to working with startups, or necessarily plugging in a new technology right away. And they were very honest. They said, listen, we haven't changed vendors or partners in over five or six years.

(00:46:04):
I actually don't even know how we would do that today. Could you come in and explain to us, understanding where our workflow is and how we would integrate this, before we even consider the technology? Which we did. We got paid a nominal amount, but we're now a customer and now we get to set the stage for how they think about this. And then they won the technology contract. But everyone is so focused on selling the technology really, really, really quickly. That works in markets that know how to buy that technology, have a process in place, have a strategy in place, have an implementation team in place.

(00:46:40):
If it's a new technology like AI right now, they need a strategy and process like who's the human in the loop? Is it them or is it you? How do we measure success? What does success look like? What risks should we be aware of? Our legal team's not even aware of all these risks. You want to be careful because legal can immediately, and procurement, can shut these things down if it seems too novel, where it's foreign versus they're so used to buying services, especially at market. It's their largest budget line item.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:10):
So it's interesting because most founders are very afraid of moving into services. I hadn't heard this advice before.

Jen Abel (00:47:15):
Probably going to get slapped for saying all this stuff, by the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:17):
Well, so along those lines, what percentage of companies that you've worked with or see do that or have to do that step?

Jen Abel (00:47:25):
This is going to be a shocking step. So I would 40 to 50% have to sell some form of service before they can sell a technology.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
Wow. Of B2B SaaS company?

Jen Abel (00:47:36):
A B2B SaaS. And this, again, this is specifically more top-down sales. But yeah, because the user and the buyer are different, which means there's user value, there's buyer value, there's all different players, there's procurement you have to go through. But yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:50):
And just to make it even clearer, what's an example of a service that you've seen company offer in a step?

Jen Abel (00:47:55):
So I've seen, hey, can you come in and actually help me pitch this, design a custom pitch to my boss as to why we should do this today? And we literally got paid to build a sales pitch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
So it's not necessarily providing a service. It could be just helping them sell this.

Jen Abel (00:48:15):
Yeah. It could be helping them sell in a way that makes you... You need to get a lot more context on their business. It can also be, hey, we haven't actually thought about a process for how we can actually deploy something like this. We're currently using this technology, which we want to change from. You've kind of hit this at the right time. How would we implement or how is it best to integrate with this tool? Can we get both of you guys in a room to map this out?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):
Got it. So it's like consultants almost, like coming in to help you solve this problem.

Jen Abel (00:48:47):
It's a great point. It's consulting them towards the acquisition of the product. It's not consulting as one-off consulting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:53):
Got it. And they know that obviously you're biased, but they also want the problem solved. And they're like, great, you're going to help us solve this problem, because it's on my plate and I need your help convincing leadership that this is-

Jen Abel (00:49:04):
And I need to craft the storyline as to why we need to do it anyway, so I will pay you to do it, but here's the format it needs to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):
Fascinating. Wow. Okay. Anything else along those lines?

Jen Abel (00:49:15):
And then of course, if you're in a position to actually sell the technology, because the market is able to acquire and adopt it and not have to create a new strategy or process, then obviously sell the technology. You don't need to be selling services.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):
I want to come back real quick. The previous call, I wrote this note down as you were talking. You recommended not doing a demo and just talking about it broadly.

Jen Abel (00:49:34):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:34):
Is that your advice there?

Jen Abel (00:49:36):
On the first call. Yeah. On the first call, my fundamental belief is that the demo is a bit of the only carry you control in the sales process, right? Once they see it, it's kind of like pitching an investor. Once they take a look under the hood, that dreaminess in their eyes, they're like, oh, I saw it. So leave them wanting more. And the demo is that, leave them wanting more. Even when you do a demo, don't demo everything. Leave it for a second call. Let them invest a lot of time in you. Again, if it's qualified. Preface that, if it's qualified. But everyone races through the sales process like let's do a demo call as quickly as humanly possible.

(00:50:20):
Yes, that is important down market. That is important if you're selling a $3,000 tool, you absolutely want to be demoing as fast as humanly possible because it's a high-volume game. Upmarket, when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, you want to slow that down as fast as possible. Because you want to, one, make sure all of the right people are in the room. As soon as there's one lead on this, and if it requires other people involved, it doesn't feel like anyone else's baby. So you want it to make it feel like the group's baby versus this one individual's baby because it's very quick. Someone can easily say, I'd rather use this tool. And then there's this stalemate of nothing happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:55):
Just to maybe reiterate, so far we've talked about figure out who to talk to, pitching them on talking to you, then having that first conversation. Maybe there's another conversation in there to get them excited. And then there's just getting them past the finish line, keeping everyone aligned. Is that roughly the next step or how should we think about this?

Jen Abel (00:51:14):
Yeah, so if you are selling upmarket and you now need to go to procurement, who is the group involved in the bot. They're the professional buyers. Procurement is a very interesting function. They are very smart, very, very smart. They do this for a living. They are professional buyers. So there's a couple things that you need to be aware of. You need to sell them as well. You need to really make this sound... Don't over complicate it. Don't add in jargon. Make it feel like, okay, I can wrap my head around this. The second piece is it's got to feel different from anything else out there. Because the professional buyer, it's much easier to say, wait a second, we have these 17 other preferred vendors that do similar ish work. Why don't you just go use one of them? Because, oh, by the time this gets through procurement, it could be another three to four months.

(00:52:05):
I've seen deals die on the vine because procurement actually suggested they go use another vendor in the system, that this buyer wasn't even aware of, because they didn't differentiate. It didn't feel different. It just felt slightly better. That's how it was positioned. The third piece is when you get to procurement, you're going to have to do all the work. Make their job easy. You are probably a very small piece into the very large deals that a lot of these people buy. So you can get easily sidelined just because you're just a small buy. So do the work for them. Literally say, I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Give me the forms that you need to fill out. I'll fill them out for you, and you can do it yourself. You can edit them. Do the lift for them. If you don't, it's so easy for it to just go there and die.

(00:52:55):
Another piece that's important with procurement is explaining exactly what you do and don't do. Because if you say you do a bunch of things and they can't really place you, they're going to send you to the kitchen sink of contracting an MSA, which is going to ask you for $5 million in an insurance policy and all sorts of other things. And the ability to look at your book at any point in time. And the reason they did that is because they can't classify you. So the easiest thing to do is classify you as high risk. So make it easy for them, make it simplified. You can also truncate your contracts, meaning let's say IT is maybe, and you want to ask this, how long does it take to get through IT due diligence? They might say, oh, it's a 90-day backup, it's a 60-day backup, it's a 30-day backup.

(00:53:43):
There's no backup. If there's a backup, you also don't want it to die and you want it to give an incentive. So this is when you want to truncate contracts to a technology contract and a service contract. Service contract allows you to onboard them, get them prepped, come in and educate all of the users about what they're about to go through. So that then there's an incentive to get that technology piece through. There's all these little things to think about, and I think everyone... Getting to procurement is also creative. And knowing who you're dealing with and how to make their job as easy as humanly possible. Because what you said and what April said is spot on, which is buying is just as hard as selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:23):
As I'm hearing you describe this, I feel like we might be discouraging people from selling because this feels very not fun. All these steps, all these procurement work, anything you can say to get people to feel like, okay, this is worth it?

Jen Abel (00:54:35):
Yes, I can get people very excited by this. Once you are in, you are in. Once you are in, you are now a preferred vendor. You now have the ability to cross over into other business units. You are now the reason that, hey, if your competitor comes in, well, you got there first. So what do you think procurement's going to say? This is why it's so important to get into the enterprise as fast as humanly possible. While it's a headache to get through, if you project manage it, you'll be good. If you make an accountability, just like if you were to go through fundraising. If you are a part of a team that had to raise money, it's no different. There's always some level of due diligence. There's always you doing more of the work than them. That's just enterprise sales. But if you prove value, your hundred thousand dollars deal could be $500,000 next year. Your $500,000 deal could be a million dollars the following year.

(00:55:36):
This is where stuff begins to compound, and this is where your growth journey really gets accelerated. So the beauty with enterprise is once you're in, you're in. You beat out your competitor for a short period of time. There is a little bit of a moat there, but it's not forever. You all have intel that no one else will have. Meaning you're a part of the conversations, you have the badge, you can join the meetings, you can ask for introductions. They'll do it. It doesn't feel like sales anymore. You're now a partner. This is why it's so powerful to get into the enterprise because there's so many compounding effects. If you put the effort in on the sales side, the return is insane.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):
That was awesome. Nailed it. I'm excited. Just for folks that are listening, just to calibrate what size of company you're talking about selling to here, what's the size of the advice you've been sharing so far? Roughly?

Jen Abel (00:56:33):
So I've been talking a lot about enterprise sales, which is I would say anywhere north of 500 to a thousand employees. Just mental model. I'm talking about enterprise sales specifically because there's so much nuance involved in it, because the user and the buyer are very different, right? As you go down market, let's talk about small business for a second. The user and the buyer are the same person. There's no procurement. If they like what you've built, it's pretty straightforward process. In the mid-market, mid-market is a funky place because you either are anchoring towards the lower end of mid-market, which is more upper end of small business, or you're anchoring towards lower end enterprise. Those are two very different divides. So mid-market, just if you're talking about lower end enterprise, again, this is all relative. If you're talking about lower end small business, again, your user and the buyer probably are the same person, which makes sales a lot more streamlined.

(00:57:31):
But churn. Small business, challenge with small business is the churn. If they get pissed off, if they don't feel like it's good enough, they are gone faster than you don't even realize. And they might even tell you. They'll just cancel. And we always see this on Twitter. They'll call American Express and say, cancel these charges. I don't want to talk to these people anymore. They're just more irrational because sometimes maybe it's their money if they're a small business. So small business in mid-market, while sales is a bit faster, you really got to be on the product market fit side, worried about churn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):
And they also go out of business at a higher rate.

Jen Abel (00:58:07):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):
And so you have that kind of churn.

Jen Abel (00:58:12):
A churn piece too. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:14):
Amazing. Okay. What comes next? So we're kind of in procurement at this point.

Jen Abel (00:58:19):
Okay, so now we're at signature, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:21):
Okay.

Jen Abel (00:58:21):
Okay. So as you enter procurement, okay, you want to know before you get to the next stage, who is signing this deal? Here are some examples of signers I've seen. Chief financial officer, chief legal officer, the business unit head themselves, the head of procurement. You want to know who that person is so that you can literally say to the head of procurement, hey, listen, I want to make sure this person has everything they need when they review this, to know what they're signing. Who is it and how can I give you a few bullets to share that you can maybe respond to, that we get tight so that they know exactly what they're looking at?

(00:58:59):
This was two or three years ago, I was involved in getting a deal over procurement that was just truly, it was a pharmaceutical company and it was very, very long process. And we got to the finish line and the CFO was the signature. And this is when I made the mistake. CFO responds back to the procurement lead who sent it to the business unit, who sent it to me and was like, what am I signing? I don't actually understand what these people are doing and why are we doing this?

(00:59:32):
So then she quickly said to me, hey, listen, we need to defend this. Can you put together some bullets? And I'm like, well, what kind of bullets do I need? What does this person care about? And again, it created so much anxiety and now I'm back in the bottom of the queue. Probably he or she's looking at the things that come in in an order of priority. So now I've elongated this by another month simply because I didn't plan. So this is just to say I'm learning from my own mistake of know who the signature is, because if they don't know what they're looking at, they're going to kick it out and you're going to lose your queue spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):
So many ways to fail. And this was you selling Jellyfish or this was you working with a company?

Jen Abel (01:00:11):
This was me helping [inaudible 01:00:15].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):
Oh man. Okay. Anything else in that step that might be helpful to folks?

Jen Abel (01:00:19):
Yes. One thing to caveat is you do not get paid until you are approved by finance, and procurement has a signature on the contract. Meaning don't start any work. Or if you do start work, know that there is no payment. The business unit can't just pay you. It's paid through a purchase order, which is paid through by finance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
So don't rely on that money unless it's finally, unless the signature's on the paper. Quick tangent, thoughts on discounting at any parts of the journey?

Jen Abel (01:00:54):
If there is a reason as to why. So discounting just to get the deal over the line, you're negotiating with yourself. Unless they ask for it and then ask them to defend it. Certain segments, like small business, you should leave a little bit of room for buffer because sometimes that's their own money. It's like their own small business. Mid-market and enterprise, there's got to be a reason why and ask them. Be like, hey, so if I give you a 30% discount, can I remove 30% of the value? You can kind of play it a little bit like that. I don't recommend it, but that's kind of what they're saying. But discounting is great if they're doing something for you far and beyond. For example, if they're a design partner, if they're going to be a reference for two years, if they're going to give you something far beyond just using the technology, then yeah, I think a discount is a good reason to give back to somebody that's giving to you, but not as a strategy to get a deal done.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:57):
Okay. Is there anything beyond this step of getting the signature? Are we done?

Jen Abel (01:02:01):
Yeah. I hope you celebrate because-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):
Okay, great. You got a signature from this whole process.

Jen Abel (01:02:08):
Yeah. Hopefully I'm not making this sound too daunting. I'm just really trying to lay out all the mistakes I've made.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):
Yeah, no, this is exactly what people need. This is amazing. And your pep talk was really helpful too. Along the way. What's the general timeline for sales process like this in your experience, with these 500 plus ice companies?

Jen Abel (01:02:26):
So there's three things that dictate sales cycle. One is how well are you project managing it? For example, I'll say, let's have our second or third call in two weeks. Two weeks? Do a week. Why are you elongating this? Keep your calls as tight as possible because that shortens your sales cycle. The second is just how complex the organization is. If you're dealing with a highly regulated industry, just know it's going to take a bit longer, sometimes 20 to 30% longer. So a highly regulated industry, nine to 12 months on conservative, on the conservative side. Again, it's tricky because is there a budget line item dictated towards it yet, or are you creating budget? How painful is the problem? And how senior have you gone? If you're talking to the SVP or chief of whatever, they're pretty good at about being able to navigate the traps.

(01:03:28):
If you're dealing with a director or mid-level person, they maybe have not purchased something before and just make some internal mistakes. I always say it can range anywhere. I've seen enterprise deals close in 90 days, believe it or not. Rare, but I've seen it. I've also seen enterprise deals typically take anywhere between six and 12 months. Really important but. Enterprises know that the process and the length to get the deal done is what costs more than the technology itself. Meaning the effort it takes to get through their system. That's why they're willing to spend so much. Sometimes that's actually more expensive than the technology itself. So don't negotiate with yourself, understand the value you're delivering, but don't be crazy. I've seen people try and go in with a million dollar deal as a seed stage startup. Oh, interesting thing. So interesting tactic. I've seen contracts in the enterprise that state that the deal cannot exceed more than 20% of the existing revenue.

(01:04:39):
So there are these things just to be aware of. In most cases, you can ask them be like, is that a hard line? Is that hard, hard line? Or how negotiable is that? Sometimes it's negotiable. Sometimes it's like, no, this is a hard rule. But then it seems silly because you take a hundred thousand dollar deal and bring it down to 20,000. It's just be careful that you're stripping some of the value out. But I kid you not. I've seen an enterprise deal go from, it lands at 60 and it turns into 280,000 in four months. So again, I want to encourage, yes, this is a lot of work, but the payoff is exponential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):
What's a good ACV to start with if you're trying to sell to enterprise, to make it all worth it for your startup?

Jen Abel (01:05:25):
I would say anywhere between 50 to 200K depending on the business unit you're selling to. That's kind of like sweet spot. They're used to something in that realm.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:35):
And this is a startup selling [inaudible 01:05:38].

Jen Abel (01:05:37):
Early stage startup, like founder led, early stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Initial contract. Wow.

Jen Abel (01:05:43):
Yep. Initial contract. I would say, okay, probably caters more towards like 50 to 100K. But I've seen people sell to... Again, it's how big is the problem? Who are you selling it to? Is it the SVP that you started with and they've got a large budget, and it's a pretty healthy business unit? Or are you selling to a director?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:05):
If you're not able to sell your product at that price? What's your advice to teams?

Jen Abel (01:06:10):
If you are a startup, I always ask the founder, did you build this for the enterprise and is that the model you want to play? Or did you build this for small business? Small business is a marketing game. Marketing intensive activity, right? It's high velocity, high volume, lots of dials. It's a very different game than enterprise. So which game do you want to play? Let's just start there. Which game is more attractive to the founder. Or who is more exciting to serve? What's the storyline you want to tell investors? That plays a lot of it into it too. And do you have an enterprise product? Are you solving an enterprise problem or do you think you're solving an enterprise problem but you're not sure yet?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:53):
And your point is also mid-market is it's rarely to be successful.

Jen Abel (01:06:57):
It's hard to start there because you're straddling two very different go-to-markets, right? One that's of high value, one that's of high volume. And also mid-market companies, this is where a lot of people don't... If it requires heavy integration, they don't have those resources. That's usually outsourced to an Accenture or some of these consulting firms, and now you're having to rely on third parties to be involved. It gets messy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):
This is fascinating. I have a list of questions from the audience that you pulled from Twitter. You asked on Twitter what questions to ask you as you're coming on here. So there's one that's very related to this, which is someone said, if you're still very early in pre-product market fit, but get initial validation from both small to medium businesses and enterprise, how do you decide which one to focus on? Is there a counter argument against starting or SMB going up market over time like most companies do?

Jen Abel (01:07:51):
I've seen companies successfully do in both of those motions. Truthfully. We know all of those. We know people that started small business and worked their way up into enterprise and were successful. We've seen people be really successful by starting at the enterprise, like a Wiz. That's more of an internal question, which is like, who did you build this for? Where's the problem most felt and which go-to-market game do you want to play?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):
And I think that latter part is so important. It sounds like why should it be what I want? It's like what's going to make a big business? But I think people forget, this is going to be your life for 10 years. Do you want to be selling to enterprises and building all the enterprise features? Would you prefer to build for small companies? Pros and cons to both but it's important to think about the life you're creating for yourself and your team.

Jen Abel (01:08:36):
A hundred percent. And I built my career in enterprise sales, upper-end mid-market enterprise sales, and yeah, that's just the game I know the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:46):
Yeah, that's also an important part of it. Just to double down on that is like what do you have experience doing? Not like...

Jen Abel (01:08:52):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:53):
Yeah. Where's the opportunity? Okay. Another question that I love is, and we touched on this initially, but I think it's good to come back to this. Someone said, customers are fascinated with what we're offering from the initial calls, but responsive momentum is too slow from their end. Would be great to know how to fix this.

Jen Abel (01:09:10):
Yeah, it's tough because unless you're in the weeds to understand why. I'll give you a few examples that it could be. Did you speak to a buyer who now is trying to sell this up to their boss, and it's just getting sidelined and they don't know the executive value? They've just been selling the buyer value the whole time. That's one reason things can slow down. Another reason things can slow down is you haven't really framed the problem well and they don't understand the full implications of why they need to solve it. So it's kind of just sitting there a little bit. The third is they've just been really nice and it's not going to go anywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:49):
I guess that that's usually the latter. Was that true or it's kind of all over the place?

Jen Abel (01:09:54):
It's so hard to give a founder hard feedback. Because they've just dedicated their life to this thing. Who wants to be the bearer of bad news? And sometimes you just need to let the actions speak louder than words.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:11):
We've talked about all these steps. I'm curious, when you come to a founder or your team, where do you find the most on lock often? Which of the steps of the sales process do you find the biggest opportunity to improve conversion in sales?

Jen Abel (01:10:25):
It's qualification. Qualification because if you spend your time on the wrong leads, that equates to a zero. So if you don't get that first level right, let me put it this way, everyone that I know says they have a bottom of funnel problem. It's never a bottom of funnel problem. It's a top of funnel problem. I've actually never seen a bottom of funnel sales problem. It's always qualification, which is a symptom of not reaching out to the right person, not having the right messaging, not solving the right problem, or not being different enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
I love this. So basically the biggest pitfall people fall into, in your experience, is they're just talking to the wrong people, wasting their time?

Jen Abel (01:11:15):
Yeah. Talking to the wrong people or using the wrong message or...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Pitching them something they can't actually deliver.

Jen Abel (01:11:23):
Yeah. Here's the other thing too. Sales is supposed to feel fun for the buyer. They should be like, this feels fun. This person's invigorating. They're going to change my world. They're going to make me see things differently. They're going to get me promoted. They're going to help me increase my influence internally. And so many salespeople are so boring. How many times have you got off a call and you're like, I can't wait to get off this call? And founders too, just like all of a sudden their passion, they go like stone cold face. And it's like bring the passion. Bring the energy. That is felt by the market. Remember, some of these people are in boring jobs. Give them an outlet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:01):
So along those lines, I think a lot of people are just not... Like me included. I feel weird doing sales. It's a weird experience trying to convince someone to buy something. Is there any advice you could share to get someone over that hump?

Jen Abel (01:12:13):
If you have built something that you believe in. Very hard to sell something you don't believe in. I think everyone agrees that. If you've built something you believe in and they have a problem, that's a beautiful thing. Truthfully, that's what makes the world go around, is I have a solution to your problem. Now you just need make sure that the problem, you just need to be honest, that the problem they have, your solution truly can solve for. And you're not short selling just to get a logo and a deal over the line, and see them churn in six months or nine months or three months. That what you are selling is truly going to solve their problem. And be honest about it. I can't tell you enough when I tell someone, listen, I don't think I'm the right fit for you. They try and sell you on them.

(01:12:58):
They're like, well, wait a second. Hold on. What if we did this, this, and this? And it's like, no, no, no. Here's what we're great at. And then they can say, well, I also need that too. And all of a sudden, this level of trust comes out. And trust is the number one currency in sales. If you are a trusted salesperson, people will recommend you all day and every day. If you're a trusted founder, your market will continually send you leads and word of mouth. So don't try and sell something just to prove to investors you sold something, because it'll be quickly seen on the other side when they churn.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):
Amazing. Okay, Jen, so I'm going to cut the lightning round. I know you also have to run and do real work. So let me give you a chance just to talk about what you do, how you help companies in case folks can find value in working with you.

Jen Abel (01:13:44):
Deeply passionate about sales, as I'm sure you can tell. We specifically help founders through this pain. Navigating enterprise sales, mid-market sales, and really trying to crack that first million of ARR. Or sometimes even that first 500K of ARR if they move fast enough. And it is really hard. It's counterintuitive to what most people think, but it can be really, really fun when we show you the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):
And you described to me how it works, and I think it's important to clarify this. You basically embed with the team and help them do this.

Jen Abel (01:14:19):
Yes. So I fundamentally do not believe in outsourcing the heartbeat of the organization, which is sales. So what we do is we embed alongside the founder and drive a lot of the execution, but make sure that they are the tip of the spear engaging directly with their market, and learning directly from the market's mouth, not playing this game of telephone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):
Amazing. And I mentioned this when we were chatting, but I think of it again, is when I was interviewing all these companies about how they started selling early on. One of the interesting threads that I heard again and again, is how many of them hired a coach or a consultant as a founder to help them learn to do sales. And that's essentially what you do. And I didn't even know a service like this existed, so this is super cool. It'll point people to what you do. I also have to ask you, the question I ask everyone at the end is just, how can listeners be useful to you?

Jen Abel (01:15:08):
Help each other out. I think so many people have helped me in my career, and in this journey, that the pay it forward model that exists in the technology space is so beautiful. So just don't let that die.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Beautiful. Well, Jen, thank you so much for being here.

Jen Abel (01:15:32):
Lenny, this was awesome. Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:34):

# $1M to $10M: The enterprise sales playbook with Jen Abel

## Transcript

Jen Abel (00:00:00):
You need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity. The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
Most founders would rather get 10, 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal.

Jen Abel (00:00:17):
In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you. If they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
It might be giving you a false sense of success and product market fit.

Jen Abel (00:00:34):
As soon as you become a comparison, as soon as you become one of three that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost. It's all about differentiation. Here's what you will be able to do tomorrow because of how we're going to serve you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
Something else that you talk about is that enterprise sales is very creative.

Jen Abel (00:00:52):
It's more of an art. It's all about deal crafting. It is a relationship you're building with someone. If they know they can call on you, people will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, "It's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible?" And she's like, "It's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it." These are how enterprise deals gets done. It's relationships.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
What's kind of like the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling?

Jen Abel (00:01:18):
I don't use a tool. The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is trick or treating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guest is Jen Abel, co-founder of JJELLYFISH where she and her team help early stage founders learn how to sell and now GM of Enterprise at State Affairs. If you want to become better at selling your product, this episode is going to blow your mind and make you so much better in every way. This is the second time Jen's been on the podcast. Our first conversation was focused around getting from zero to 1 million ARR, essentially founder led sales.

Jen Abel (00:04:45):
Lenny, it's starting to feel familiar and I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
I should have said welcome back to the podcast. So I actually shared on Twitter that you're coming back and I had so many people ask so many questions. Clearly, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of need for learning how to get better at the stuff, we're going to talk about sales, enterprise sales to frame the discussion, our first chat, which we're going to point people to if they want to start there, we focused on founder-led sales, which is essentially the beginning phases of a startup, kind of going from zero to about 100 million ARR.

(00:05:17):
This discussion is on the next phase, which is going from about a million ARR to about 10 million ARR in enterprise sales, not like PLG or anything like that. You have a bunch of really strong and counter intuitive opinions and piece of advice on how to be successful at this. So I'm just going to go through a bunch of these things. We'll see where it goes. Before we get into the first one, is there anything broadly, I don't know, is there anything broadly you want to share? Anything you want to say before we dive in?

Jen Abel (00:05:41):
No, let's dive right in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:42):
Okay. Okay, so the first thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about before is this point that you often make that the mid-market does not exist. People often hear about enterprise companies. There's obviously SMBs and startups. There's also people just, "Oh, I'm going to go after the mid-market." Somewhere between. You don't think that's real? Talk about your experience there, what people should know.

Jen Abel (00:06:03):
It's fascinating because if you ask someone to describe the mid-market, actually, if you ask someone to describe the enterprise, every single person has a different answer. It's either based off of revenue, it's either based off of market cap, it's based off of employee size, and I think a lot of people can get lost because selling to a hundred person organization is a radically different game than selling to a thousand person organization and there's no hybrid approach.

(00:06:35):
So the best way to think about it is you have small business which typically can be really powered by marketing, and then you have enterprise, which is typically going to be sales led. If you bucket them into these two very specific silos, it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're playing. Now, when we talk about mid-market, I usually will say, "Are we talking about the upper end of small business or are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?"

(00:07:04):
And most people are usually saying the lower end of enterprise. And I say, "Great, know you're playing the enterprise game. Know the type of people you need to hire, the type of ACV they need because it makes it a lot easier than trying to have this middle ground that catches everything that doesn't distinctly define SMB and enterprise." So I say the mid-market doesn't exist because what is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB, and if you bleed those two games you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different. So that's kind of my theory on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
You have this chart that you shared with me that will link people to where you kind of show the number of companies within each of these segments and there's basically nobody in this kind of middle segment, talk about that a bit.

Jen Abel (00:07:46):
That's right, and just like the power laws, if you look at the Fortune 1,000 and then the lower end enterprise from there, it trails off so fast. Power laws totally exist in these large corporations and we can't be treating everyone the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):
This begs the question, where do you suggest companies start? There's obviously startups classically are just like innovators, move fast, can make quick decisions, enterprises have all the money. Usually the advice I hear is just don't go after the fancy companies to start because they take a long time. You don't want to screw it up. What's your advice on where to start for most companies?

Jen Abel (00:08:30):
The exact opposite. Early adopters are those logos because they have to continue to stay at the number one spot. So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay in the ... Staying in the number one spot is the hardest part. So those number one logos are like if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha, just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted, that's where I get the pat on the back because we are the world's leader in our industry and we cannot be disrupted there.

(00:09:05):
So there's this running joke where not a running joke, there's this running statement where a lot of VCs will say, "Don't go after tier one logos, go learn down market." Or, "o learn from logos that don't necessarily carry a lot of weight." The ones that carry all the weight are the ones that are willing to take a shot and want to help, right? Because they also want to be, they also want to be able to dictate the roadmap.

(00:09:30):
Now it's the founder's job to decide what can be done and what shouldn't be done, but their voice takes you a $100,000 deal into a million dollar deal in a very short period of time. It will literally guide you there. So when someone says, "Hey, go after startups, such as short sales cycle." Yeah, that makes sense. I totally get that. It's very easy to define the decision maker.

(00:09:54):
It's very easy, you don't have to go through procurement, but in the age of AI where it's all about sucking the oxygen out of the room and winning the deal and getting your foot in the door as quickly as humanly possible before someone else tries to take that, you want to get to the enterprise as fast as humanly possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Just so folks understand what we're talking about here, when you say tier one, what's a good way to think about what tier one is?

Jen Abel (00:10:16):
Tier one is like your Walmarts, your McDonald's, your NVIDIAs, your Tesla, your ExxonMobil, your UnitedHealthcare, the logos that are the leader in their space, their job is to stay in the number one spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:35):
Wow. Your advice is because this is very counterintuitive. This is exactly what you're here not to do. Your advice is go after the Chevrons and the Mobils and the Walmarts as a startup.

Jen Abel (00:10:46):
Because if you can get them, that's all the proof you need.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
How do you approach finding someone? Let's just get tactical there. Just like say you're going after Walmart. I know this is not a five-second answer, but just how would someone approach finding someone at Walmart to sell to?

Jen Abel (00:11:01):
First of all, make sure the founder is involved, right? Everyone loves talking to a founder, so we'll start with let's get the founder involved as fast as human possible. The second is you need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. There's a very big difference between problem selling and gap selling. Problem selling is highly specific, more technical than not, and it's the way that every salesperson is going to go about it, find the problem and anchor to it.

(00:11:33):
When you're selling to a leader, you need to be vision casting and you need to be selling an opportunity which is they are here, here's where we can take you. You know that image where it's like Mario or Mario, and then there's the mushroom and then there's Mario on blast, and everyone is like, "Don't sell the mushroom, sell Mario on blast." Well, that's exactly what it's saying.

(00:11:57):
It's about selling the opportunity. That's what gets the tier one logos excited and that is the best thing for a founder to sell, selling the vision versus the problem, and also it's what gets them to want to take a swing. Who wants to take a swing because you can do some small problem? They're not going to go to bath for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):
What's an example of a vision cast in a company you've worked with just to make this real? What does it look like when you've done a great job?

Jen Abel (00:12:23):
We have an ability to deliver alpha, meaning, we have information, we have data, we have a way of working that no one else can do or is going to unlock a new way of thinking for you or an ability to deliver to a customer or an ability to solve a problem. Right now, you have an ability to access this level of information. I have an opportunity through our resources or through this gated data, we have access to get you much further upstream so that you can get information faster sooner. It's kind of like the high-frequency trading that one second, that one second. They didn't do much. They didn't sell, "Oh, we're doing fiber cable connectivity. We're giving you one second of alpha before everyone else." It's more of that ability and that's not problem-selling, that's opportunity selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:14):
I like this phrasing of just giving them alpha, that's such a simple way to imagine what this should feel like. We'll link to that image you're talking about with the Mario and-

Jen Abel (00:13:22):
You know that image?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
Yeah, the person that made that image originally is Kathy Sierra, if you remember her, do you remember? So there's this person, Kathy Sierra, she's from back in the day. This was a big, I don't know, lesson she taught is you want to not sell your people on a feature or a product. You want to sell them on them becoming a superhero.

Jen Abel (00:13:42):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):
They are now a superhero because of the thing you've built for them. And so the vision here is here's how you become a superhero. Here's how this alpha will help you become more successful.

Jen Abel (00:13:50):
And that's why founders are so good at selling because they naturally go to vision selling and vision casting versus a typical trained salesperson is find the problem, ask these questions and it just kills the vibe. It just feels like you're talking to a salesperson, right?

(00:14:08):
It's like, "What's your script? And it's like that's not vision selling, that's like playbook selling." And in the age of AI where a lot of it is Alpha, it's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data, and look at how the market is reacting to it. It's all opportunity and it's all about the alpha.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:30):
So just to make this more concrete for people, Sam, like sales person at Cursor, what would be an example of vision casting? The obvious idea there is your team will be more productive, you'll get more done faster than everybody else. Is that a big enough vision to cast?

Jen Abel (00:14:47):
I think it may be more of you'll be able to actually hire the 10X engineers that you don't necessarily have access to because they want to be able to use this type of tool. It's about letting them get differentiated talent or that's probably more of what I would anchor to of this is the 10X engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10X engineers?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:16):
They won't even join your company if you're not using Cursor.

Jen Abel (00:15:18):
Yeah, yeah. Think about it. So many people are so specific about what they're able to, I think especially technical folks, I'm not a technical person, but I would imagine that they're not going to go to, they don't like to go to these corporations because they're forced to use some incumbent tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
Going back to going after these larger companies, I asked your colleague, Justin, what he sees you do that most impacts the success that teams have with their sales process. And there's a bunch of I'm going to touch on, but one is most founders are insecure about asking for large ACVs for charging, or the way he put it is most founders would rather get 10 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal. Talk about your advice there and what you see.

Jen Abel (00:16:04):
There are in the very early days is people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you because that's like a qualification criteria, which is like if they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you being like, "No, I don't believe it's worth this. I don't believe it's worth that." They're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

(00:16:32):
So when I say I'd rather get $100,000 deal than $10,000 deals, I'd rather have one rock star client that's going to help me figure out the next stage of where this is going than 10 or maybe five that are a good fit, five that are not, and I still have to serve those five that are not a good fit, and that's going to distract me. So this is why I love enterprise sales is they're not going to do the hard work of bringing you in if it's not critical or if it's not, when I say critical, it's going to impact them in a way that they're going to make it successful, that's what I love about enterprise sales.

(00:17:14):
They have the resources to ensure that it gets implemented because most in today's day and age, if people are not using the tool, you just get rid of the tool. So they're going to want to make sure whatever they bring in, what they go to bat for, remember, they go to bat once every two years, maybe once every three years. You've got to make it feel incredible. You've got to make it feel like they're going to be a superhero going back to it.

(00:17:42):
Otherwise, what's the point? Because the way enterprises are structured is it is designed today to make it hard to buy because they want to make sure whatever you're bringing in, you really, really want it gets rid of the mediocre. I think this would be good and it gets to this is going to change the way we work. It's going to impact our ability to capture some form of alpha, however you want to define that for them and it's sticky because of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:16):
So your advice here broadly is don't pay attention to the smaller 10K-ish kind of opportunities for a bunch of reasons. One is it might be giving you a false sense of success in product market fit. Two, those companies are maybe not as innovative and won't lead you in the right direction. Three are probably discounts just like your product than your pricing just gets thrown off.

Jen Abel (00:18:38):
Yep, and also you don't really get taken seriously for 10K. You get way more taken seriously for a 100Ks, it's much harder to get a 100K deal done and an executive use needs to be involved. I'd much rather have an executive sign-off on something and spend two more months getting the deal done because you know that they are bought in, you can now ensure what kind of value do they want to unlock and maybe you have an opportunity to turn them into a user, which to me, in today's day and age, with our generation being the ones that are now the executives at these corporations, this is native to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:15):
Who is this true for? Is the advice here basically, if you're trying to build a successful B2B company, everybody should be aiming towards these a 100K sort of deals? Is there a world where you can be successful with 10Ks for a long time?

Jen Abel (00:19:30):
If you have a super high win rate in a massive market, because all you have to do is reverse engineer the math. If you need to generate a hundred million dollars in revenue, how many 10K deals do you need? And the expansion on a 10K deal is in parallel to that. Where can you go? 10 to 15? That's a 50% growth, much easier to go to a 100K to 500K because they want more bodies or they want more value out of you.

(00:19:58):
For an enterprise, they'd love to get more out of an existing customer. You're already trusted. So it's also about the type of company you are. If you're venture-backed, you can't be selling $10,000 deals to the enterprise, you'll get killed, or you've already lost the game because you're playing a small business game in the wrong sector.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:17):
Have you seen startups you've worked with succeed in that 10K, 20K bucket or is it really, really rare?

Jen Abel (00:20:23):
If they're going after the enterprise?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Yeah.

Jen Abel (00:20:25):
Yes, if it's the first three months and then after three months, it turns into a 50K and then a 100K and it ramps up quickly. Sure, that makes sense. You got your foot in the door and you can expand it exponentially in a healthy manner. I think that that's fine. $10,000 a year, then going to 12, then going to 15, the math will break.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
This is great. I feel like most founders to this are like, "No, no, we're kind of in that exception we'll be all right. 10K, we'll do 20K. That's crazy to consider 100K."

Jen Abel (00:20:52):
Yeah, the math will break. And also, a really good salesperson, you're commissioned on a 10K deal, they're not going to get a great salesperson. They're going to want to be anchored to how can I sell a $250,000 deal? How can I sell a half a million dollar deal? That's the type of person you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
And a big part of this is this is a good lens to force you to build the product that you can sell for 100K, 500K.

Jen Abel (00:21:19):
Yeah, absolutely. And again, this is about playing that enterprise game. If you're trying to sell, if you're a small business, if you're in the small business place and an enterprise company comes to you and is like, "I like this." Ensure that you structure it for an enterprise. Don't play the small business team with an enterprise company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:38):
Talk more about that. What does that mean?

Jen Abel (00:21:40):
Let's say you're PLG, and a big company like Walmart comes to and is like, "Hey, can we get access for three of our users?" And they're like, "This is so exciting." And then they sell them the small business pricing for three users to Walmart. Very, very hard now to go from those three users that you just priced them at in a small business way, turn that into 100K because now it's documented what they're actually paying for this.

(00:22:08):
So you're stuck. You've kind of anchored yourself to this price. Not to mention how are you going to unlock the executive high level value so that you can get that senior executive to buy in and stamp this as well. Otherwise, it's just going to be throwing it on the credit card. But again, you've just ruined your enterprise game because you're anchoring to a small business price.

(00:22:34):
So this is why when you bleed these two games, it's very, very, very dangerous because these are really smart companies. They're going to say, "Well, wait a second, I just paid $9,000 last year and now you want to charge me $90,000. Well, what's the step change in value? What's the 10X value I'm now getting?" That's super hard to prove.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:54):
So the tip here is your initial price will really screw you if you get it wrong. And so obviously we're not going to give people the answer on their pricing strategy fully, but just is the advice just charged more or what would you recommend?

Jen Abel (00:23:08):
It is enterprise companies are very used to a land, when I say the first initial contract, somewhat between 75K and 150K, very used to that. In fact, that's probably where you want to start because you also want to understand where can you grow from this. Start contained, don't say 150K and sell the farm. Say, "It's 150K, here's who gets access, here's the value we're going to deliver and here's where we're going over time." You also want them to know, "Here's what we plan to do roughly in year two, year three."

(00:23:42):
I know it's hard to look that far out, but plant the seed with them in terms of where this is going. If you come in at $10,000, even if they want to bring you in and want to spend 100K with you, they have to be able to defend that and now they see a $10,000, it can get really messy, especially because a lot of them are using AI now to understand contracts. So they're going to quickly say, "Oh wait, you spent a thousand dollars with Lenny and now Lenny is asking you for a 100K. Great. Just help me understand why or defend it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:15):
I could totally see ChatGPT being like, "This is interesting."

Jen Abel (00:24:19):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:19):
It used to be 1K, now it's a 100K. What might be going on here?

Jen Abel (00:24:22):
Totally. The people don't realize how, again, know the game you're playing and don't be sloppy about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
So your advice here is really interesting. There's the land to expand. Expand is very important, but the landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point.

Jen Abel (00:24:45):
1,000%. That's exactly right. You said it better than I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:48):
And so you may see in theory if you land a 10K go to 100K, that's an amazing NRR, everyone's going to be really impressed. But you're saying people won't buy into that. It's going to feel absurd and wrong.

Jen Abel (00:25:00):
Unless it's defendable. All it needs to be is defendable. But who can really defend? That's very hard to defend a 10X. 10X jump, they're going to want to see 15X value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:11):
Let's talk about design partners.

Jen Abel (00:25:12):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
This is something most founders try to do. They find a few folks to work with, to help them build the thing. What's your advice on when to start finding design partners? How to find design partners, what a good relationship looks like?

Jen Abel (00:25:24):
Design partners are incredible. They're the hardest logos to upsell, meaning go from design partner to full rollout customer. So don't expect these people to be your million dollar pipeline. Expect these people to be the guide, to help you understand, maybe design partners could be a technology company in the Fortune 1,000.

(00:25:50):
So they're used to experimenting. They're used to technology, they're used to, they were once a startup, so they get it. Those make really good design partners. Most of the design partners that I've closed are usually technology based. They get it and they also are excited about advancing the org and also giving the team an ability to have that startup feel.

(00:26:12):
So if you're a large massive corporation like Stripe. Stripe doesn't get that startup vibe as much like that 50 person startup vibe, but this can be a gift to give them that lens and give them that voice and give them that excitement that they don't get as a larger company. But those are great types of logos to be early design partners because one, they want to make sure they continue to stay on the cutting edge, but two is they are, to try and build something without that guidance is really, really, really hard because they're not using it.

(00:26:54):
So you need that user feedback and you also need to tie that to the executive value. It's actually a lot, it's very hard to do, but if you can come out of it and upsell a design partner to a full rollout customer, such a huge win for the market for you, for your team, and also for your investors because it's the hardest customer to actually truly convert.

(00:27:23):
They've been it when it was messy, they usually got a low price point. But if you again frame it, say, "Listen, I would love for you to be a design partner. I want a little skin in the game to get you to point it. Here's where we want to go and you'll get a discount because you were in the beginning, but I'm setting the framing. Here's where we want to go with pricing. Here's where we are today. You'll always have 30% concession in perpetuity because you are there with us on day one."

(00:27:49):
So again, it's not about asking for $10,000 and then not expecting that design partner to upsell and keep it flat because there's no growth there. It's a flat. It's about getting that early design partner, set the framing, own the framing and let them know where you're going. Again, a $100,000 to these large logos if they want it, it's very easy for them to get it in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:11):
There's this really interesting underlying piece of advice of finding a company that pulls you in the direction that leads to success. A company that's kind of a visionary. There's the obvious companies that everyone is always trying to get these days, OpenAI and Anthropic and Stripe I think is one. And any advice for just picking the right early? What are signs that this is a company that will point you in the right direction?

Jen Abel (00:28:34):
I think they have to be part of a logo that is deemed startup-friendly or in that world, and then I think it's the person, is this person excited to give feedback? Does this person buy in to where we're going? Do they see this world differently like us? Are they in lockstep with the founder vision?

(00:28:58):
Are they excited to use a tool that's janky? Because it is janky in the beginning, but they know that where this can go can be incredible. So I think it's really about the person and making sure that they're aligned for what they're getting into, and I think a lot of salespeople oversell it. I think that's a common thing that happens and that leads to churn, that leads to frustration, that leads to sometimes just canceling the contract.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
They oversell the initial kind of design partners phase over the product.

Jen Abel (00:29:33):
They sell everything. Yeah, design partner, even full rollout, and it's so, so important to tell them, "Here's where we are today. Here's what we cannot do." Which is just as important. It builds trust. "Here's what we will allow you to do in the next six months. Do you want to be on this journey with us? And it's really ugly right now." Right? "Barely anything exists, but we would love your voice to be a part of it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:55):
One of the biggest fears I think founders have is having a company pull, basically build just for their use case and then it ends up not being used by a lot of people. And so how far do you go fixing their specific problems? Any advice on just how far to go with one company?

Jen Abel (00:30:10):
That is the founder's job. The founder's job is to have a clear vision and do not let anything delineate from that. It's important to take feedback in terms of what is the market's reality, but it is the founder, and this is why being a founder is so hard. It is the founder's job to interpret that because a lot of feedback you get is this is the old way, they're responding this way because it's the old way of working.

(00:30:37):
They want you to build this because that's how they're traditionally expecting to do that. It is not, "Here's where we're going, this is why we're not doing that. I hear you, but here's why we're not going to do that because we're going to completely change the way you do this." That is the founder's job.

(00:30:53):
And I think we did a bunch of design partnerships late last year and there was a lot of feedback given, a lot of feedback given, but the founder had such clarity with where he wanted to go that he was like 80% noise, 20% had I not asked this question, I wouldn't have gotten that gold in terms of where they are today. And it's that 80/20 rule where 80% of what they're going to tell you is probably going to be not related to where you want to go or based off of the old way, but that 20% of, "Oh, I did not think about it that way." That drives everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
Have you seen a design partner pull a company in the wrong direction? Just screw their path? Have you seen that or is that pretty rare?

Jen Abel (00:31:42):
No, I don't think it's that rare. We hear people complain about it all the time, but I think it's more of an excuse.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):
Coming back to this question of going after the enterprise versus SMBs. And again, early advice you gave is there's no, don't go in between. Either pick SMB small company, which I know you said there's a million ways to differentiate what this means, but I guess I think of employee numbers under some number over a thousand is maybe enterprise. Is that a good way to think about it just like-

Jen Abel (00:32:13):
Yeah, it depends. Are you selling per seats or are you selling based off of usage or are you selling off of, I think it also depends on the pricing model a little bit. I look at headcount too because it's just such an easy way to think about it because you can also gauge usage off that and a bunch of other things, but sometimes the small companies, I think we're going to see a lot more larger companies become smaller because of AI, not significantly smaller, but also high margins allow them to experiment more too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
That's such an interesting point you're making there that the way we designate enterprise versus SMB like may shift because number of employees may go down with AI.

Jen Abel (00:32:57):
Yeah. Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:59):
So interesting. So where I was going to go with this question is when people are deciding, I'm going to go enterprise versus I'm going to sell to startups, like YC companies are the typical example they sell to their own YC batches and you just broad advice of picking, "Okay, we go enterprise versus no, let's actually go startup."

Jen Abel (00:33:18):
I think it's about, and I read this somewhere and I wholeheartedly agree with it because I've seen it live. I think it's about what game does the founder best understand? Are they an incredible marketer and have some competitive edge for how they can win a massive audience?

(00:33:34):
I would say go SMB and marketing led or are they a bit more really understand how large corporations work and really excited to deliver on $100,000 plus type of opportunities or the value that they are building for is way more relatable to an enterprise versus a small business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
That is really interesting. I've never heard of it described that way. I think about linear, which started very startup-ey and my take is they did that because changing the way you work is really hard and their bet was like, "Let's start with companies and grow with them and over time that becomes the default." Any reaction to that?

Jen Abel (00:34:16):
I think that it sounds like that that's a great way to work because that's a technical tool, so that you need the right, also need to have the right infrastructure to sell. I think Slack, look, Slack and Microsoft Teams are still battling it out at the enterprise. I think it's also how you plug in and how you integrate and do they even have the right systems to support you? The thing with open AI is they didn't have to connect to anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:45):
Say more about that.

Jen Abel (00:34:46):
So the value, people were bringing their own use cases to it and it's not like they, well they can ingest and they built that, it's a brand new thing and they started I think, this is someone told me this, so this could be hearsay, but I believe that they were already speaking to CTOs even well before they released to help them explain where this is all going and get their buy-in.

(00:35:17):
And it's much easier to get into the enterprise when you're like, "We won't even touch your data, won't even touch your data. Just use it to solve problems and then we can build trust and then start to integrate and connect the pipes." But part of the challenges with selling in the enterprise, they're like, "All right, well let's connect all your data in the ..." "Whoa, that's extremely risky."

(00:35:41):
So you have to start small and low risk, which is like, "Hey, what is the subset of consumers that churned? Let's figure out how we could have made them happier, whatever it be." So that data is lower risk. So again, it's also understanding your market and understanding what their ability to experiment is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:03):
It's interesting this distinction between OpenAI right now, and Anthropic, I don't know if you've been seeing their growth, it feels like OpenAI is very consumer first and Anthropic is more and more winning on B2B. I saw this chart recently where they're overtaking OpenAI now on B2B. I don't know, any reaction there of just these two different approaches?

Jen Abel (00:36:23):
I don't because most enterprises I'm talking to mentioned Gemini.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:27):
Oh, interesting.

Jen Abel (00:36:30):
Or Microsoft Copilot. So I don't hear much about Anthropic to be honest. So that might be more of a small business startup-ey, I don't know or it's a different part of the organization that's using it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:45):
Yeah, that's a whole discussion or bundling right there of Slack and teams and then just Gemini just kind of coming in automatically. People don't have to adopt anything new.

Jen Abel (00:36:54):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:55):
There's something else that you talk about that I love that I don't think people talk much about, which is that enterprise sales is very creative.

Jen Abel (00:37:03):
Oh yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:37:06):
So I personally believe that small business sales is really a, I used to think it was more science than art. It was more figuring out what didn't work, running experiments, testing and validating, which I do believe, that's to get to foundations, where do we play? What do we want to do? Like that early, early, early zero to one.

(00:37:33):
From one to 10, I think it's more of an art, which is how do I take my learning and how do I package it up where I own the framing, I can speak to very specific alpha, I can vision cast and where I better understand the problem over time better than the market does. And it's all about deal crafting.

(00:38:00):
They just need to feel like the value they're getting out of it is way more than the cost. And it's sometimes about giving away things that don't really cost much to you, but are super expensive for them. For example, "Hey, we're selling X tool. We can build out Y specifically for you over the next year and integrate it because I know that you would've spent X number of dollars on engineering resources or you wouldn't have gotten in engineering head internally to do this, but we're just leave it to you. You got to give us a year to build it out."

(00:38:37):
Again, you're not letting them sidetrack you too much, you're kind of containing it. "We'll do that for you at no additional cost." That's huge value. Right? Or, "Hey, we're going to run an event and we want you at the forefront of it. We want you to be a speaker." Huge value. So it's like all of these additional things that add value beyond just the product but are all part of the product and the vision. Everyone keeps thinking the product is just what goes into their hand.

(00:39:07):
The product is pricing. The product is the opportunity, the framing and not letting them compare you to something else. And I know we talked that on our first call, which is as soon as you become a comparison, as soon as you become one of three that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost. It's all about differentiation and it's all about here's what you will be able to do tomorrow because of how we're going to serve you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):
So along those lines, it reminds me in our first chat you actually made this point that I've never heard anyone else make, which is that services are a really good way to start getting into the companies that were most founders here. Like, "No, don't do manual stuff for the company. Build a product that you can scale." Your advice is the opposite. Actually start with self-services. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:39:59):
Enterprise is the number one thing they buy services, they know how to do it's super easy, they do it all of the time. It's like the most consistent thing they do. It's their largest budget item, external resources, consultants, whatever.

(00:40:13):
If they have a very immature way of understanding the problem or they've never purchased technology to solve it to some extent, either one, you are doing something that's never been done before, which is rare in today's day and age, or they might just be laggards on the journey. So you have to decide is this someone you really want to be working with? And if so, selling them as service, even though the technology is powering it on the backend is the fastest way to get your foot in the door.

(00:40:50):
It's what they know how to buy. Now, the idea is to once you sell that surface, once you get that foot in the door, then it's to guide them towards the product. "Hey, you're spending so much here, why don't we get you to come in and leverage the tool that's been powering this the whole time and move this more into technology serving you versus the human."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:12):
Wow. I think this will blow a lot of people's minds.

Jen Abel (00:41:15):
Palantir, this Forward Deployed Engineer, that's exactly what they're doing. There's a lot of companies out, I'm sure OpenAI, and this is what someone told me they were in and talking to CTOs and helping them better understand how AI and their organization can better work together. And it was them coaching them, educating them, whether they did it for free or not, I don't know, but they got their foot in the door, they started to build trust and then it gets adopted.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:40):
This is the epitome of doing things that don't scale that advice we always hear this is like, "Okay, this is what that looks like. We will solve this problem for you. We are using software to do it." And then over time, "Oh, you could just do this yourself. It'll cost you less. You can scale this."

Jen Abel (00:41:54):
Yep, that's right. And they don't even need to know at first that software's doing it. That could be the magic part, which is like, "Guys, we literally, we are literally doing this with our technology."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:05):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows.

(00:43:22):
There's a lot of talk these days about this idea forward deployed something volunteer was really famous for, just essentially an engineer sitting in your office solving problems with you basically as an employee. And then through that, they learn what software to build. Is that something you're seeing too?

Jen Abel (00:43:38):
Oh yeah, I think that a lot of companies, sorry, a lot of folks that serve the enterprise, they have a butt in a seat in their office. You look at these large consultancies like McKinsey, they're not in their headquarters, they're in their client's office all the time. And the other interesting thing and proof of this is how many people go to a Deloitte or Accenture and expect them to be a channel partner?

(00:44:02):
This is exactly what this is all about, which is they sell this service, they come in and then they introduce, "Hey, look at what this startup is doing over here. You might want to give them a shot. The problem with channel partnerships and why I don't believe in them is there are a hundred of you on this list and you're expecting them to sell it on your behalf."

(00:44:21):
Biggest no-no, they're not vision casters, they're not visionaries, they're consultants, but it goes all towards go. I remember startups saying, "Oh, I'm going to go win over Accenture and then have them disseminate me into their clients." And I'm like, as if that's a workable strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:41):
Okay. You know what might be helpful is, let me try to summarize some of the best pieces of advice you've shared so far. And this is specifically for folks trying to go from about a million ARR to about 10 million ARR. And then I want to ask you just what's most different about these two stages, but let me share this first. So advice one is go for tier one logos earlier than you think you should because they're early adopters, they can move fast, they can pull you in the right direction.

Jen Abel (00:45:09):
And they excite investors too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:11):
Yeah, for sure. And other leads are.

Jen Abel (00:45:14):
Yeah, and other talent, future employees. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:20):
So the counterintuitive insight here is you think they will move slow and be too busy, but they are actually the early adopters.

Jen Abel (00:45:27):
That's right. They have to maintain that number one spot. And also, all of the people that are in the number two, number three, number four spot, all want to do what number one is doing. So it's also pure referenceability too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:40):
And the point about them being the early adopters, the people that join the Stripes in OpenAIs and Anthropics are like they individually love technology and love the latest stuff. So as a human they're like, "Oh, this is cool."

Jen Abel (00:45:52):
That's exactly right. I'm just agreeing with myself, that's kind of funny. But yeah,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):
That's a good sign. So two is ideally try to price closer to about a 100K, like 75 to 150-ishK is what you said. Most enterprises are used to buying. So instead of starting or even sticking with 10K, 20K for too long, you need to make yourself go towards 75 to 150K.

Jen Abel (00:46:18):
That's right, yep. And if you were to sell a service, I know we're talking about selling services first, throw weight that over time, so maybe it's 10K a month. So they start to get used to what that pricing looks like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:28):
So this is a way to make it feel, this is like how you get to 75 to 150K is there's a service attached to it. It's not just, here's my SaaS product, we will solve this problem for you, or a person will be sitting there doing this for you.

Jen Abel (00:46:41):
Or no, it's the technology too. You can add the services. I always, well let me take that back. Whether the services is bundled into it or not, some people will unbundle it, other people will say the services is a part of it. But yeah, it nets out to 75 to 150K. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:57):
Okay. And you said that it's okay to start lower on ACVs and deals, but you need to push fast towards a 100K over a few months.

Jen Abel (00:47:05):
Yep, that's right. If you can get into an enterprise for 10K in a month, which is not doable, but if you could, and you could go from 10 K to 50 K in four months through an expansion strategy all game, that makes sense, but it's really rare and very hard to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):
And so there's two different paths there. One is land cheap and grow quickly. The other is move your ACV average up quickly. Seems like both, the latter is probably the more common strategy is just keep increasing prices.

Jen Abel (00:47:35):
Yeah, because the former you can get tripped up because they could say, "Okay, now give me an economical price for doing this for a hundred people." And then it all kind of evens out because now you're at the 100K deal anyway, but it's much, there's more room for error, which is why I say go in and try to land 100K.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:53):
By the way, in our first chat, we talked a lot about the procurement process, which is what trips a lot of people up and is really painful. And I vividly remember that conversation still. So if people are having issues getting through the sales process and procurement, a lot of good advice there.

Jen Abel (00:48:09):
And getting stuck in procurement is usually because you're not speaking to a senior enough person and they don't know how to navigate it, which is why I'm like that executive needs to be involved because as soon as the executive picks up a phone and tries to get a hold of their buying group, things move.

(00:48:27):
When people say, "Oh, I'm stuck in procurement." I'm like, "Oh, that could just be a qualification error and you never get out of it because you sold to someone too junior." So that's why the 100K is such a safe zone because even for 10K, you might have to go through procurement. So this is the surest way to make sure that you don't ... Listen, I've seen 10K take nine months to close.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):
No bueno.

Jen Abel (00:48:53):
Yeah, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):
Okay. Next piece of advice is this idea of vision casting instead of problem solving. So the advice here is instead of here's your problem, here's how our product solves it is here's how you will achieve alpha in the market by adopting the software. We talked about the example of cursor where if you adopt cursor, you're going to draw the 10X engineers that are joining other companies right now. This will give you a big advantage.

Jen Abel (00:49:16):
That's right. And yeah, it's pain versus opportunity, especially in the age of AI, and I know that we're moving into the next dimension. It's all about solving for a gap. It's seldom about solving for a very, very specific problem because people are trying to figure out what's our AI strategy? Where are we going to go with this? What is the world going to look like? I want to be a part of that new world. So it's a great time to be doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:42):
And then there's a bunch of advice you shared about design partners, of just how to select them. Your advice is definitely have design partners because they will help you build the right thing. But as a founder, you need to have a clear vision and sense of where you want to go and not just build everything they're asking you to build.

Jen Abel (00:50:00):
That's right, because important to say no. And that's all part of the framing, which is like here's, we want a little skin in the game. You set the price, but here's what we're marching towards in the next six to 12 months. Are we aligned there? If we deliver on what we say we're going to deliver, are we aligned there and do that kind of handshake?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):
Is there anything else that I missed that you think is really important for this stage?

Jen Abel (00:50:29):
So one to 10 is no longer the founder. Maybe the founder comes in very strategic points, but you need a really good enterprise salespeople. Taking someone from small business and expecting them to do enterprise sales, big no-no, it's a different game, right? Vibe like a different game.

(00:50:47):
You need to understand how corporations buy. You need to understand how executives think. You need to better understand simply just what the enterprise business model is all about and their ability to take on risk. People will bring in super junior enterprise sales reps and I'm like, "You're looking to sell to an executive and you have this person that's five years out of school with no corporate experience doing it, again, unless they have some extremely deep experience in the industry or are just a unicorn in terms of, wow, this person can sell ice to an Eskimo kind of thing."

(00:51:27):
A junior person converting an executive, again, if the founder is involved, maybe that's doable, but usually the founder can't be involved in every deal and you need people that can, I always say you need people that can cosplay a founder, which is selling the vision, getting them excited, running through a wall to get the deal done and getting creative on ... None of my deals look exactly the same, every deal looks different and that's okay because every organization has slightly different opportunities of where they want to go, and you have to kind of build towards that and the framing may change.

(00:52:14):
So it's this ability to adapt from what you're hearing and let that compound over time, but I always say, can this person cosplay the founder? I think that that's the best type of salesperson because it doesn't feel like sales. It's more of the art.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:30):
This is amazing advice. What is a common profile that you've seen be successful? What level of seniority? What kind of personality and any traits to look for?

Jen Abel (00:52:38):
Maybe a former founder if you can get that, because they're used to selling, they sold investors and they've sold employees. Two is someone with no sales experience, but has deep product experience or an engineer and can think about things in a unique way where the market is like, "Oh, this is so interesting."

(00:53:00):
Taking a typical salesperson then and putting them into a sales role almost always is where people get frustrated. The market, it feels salesy. The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy. And I know that it's very hard to hire a really good enterprise salesperson. The number of people that I've interviewed, I can count on my hand the ones that I get really, really excited by.

(00:53:29):
It's almost like coming across a great founder. It's not as common as everyone expects, and I think that that's true for engineering. I think that that's true for sales and I think a lot of people, sales is like, "Oh, just throw a body into it. The product will do the work."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:48):
Advice I often hear is don't hire a senior VP of salesperson from a bigger company. Do you agree with that? What's like to senior?

Jen Abel (00:53:55):
Yeah, so the bigger company thing, the brand was doing all of the work. The brand built the trust. You need this person to be able to build the trust and they're usually, the product is still so new. The product is the founder in the zero to one stage. The product is just starting to get a case study.

(00:54:15):
You probably have maybe a few references, but it's still very, very early days. You need the market to believe the salesperson and you need that market to know that they're trustworthy. A VP of sales at a large company, I would say, they're best suited for a large company because one to 10, you're running through walls.

(00:54:33):
You have to figure out, you're doing a lot of convincing, you're doing a lot of educating, you're doing a lot of creative deal crafting. A lot of owning the frame. It's not necessarily selling a product, it's selling that future value, which a VP of sales at a large companies, it's very different. It's a different game. It's kind of like the SMB and enterprise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):
It's interesting you said when you described the profile of a great hire here is you said they don't need to have done sales. If they have done sales, what's a number years or kind of what do you look for that tells you, "Okay, this is a good fit for the first hire."

Jen Abel (00:55:06):
I actually think it's less about experience and more about the person. Does this person make you feel good? Do you want to buy from this person? I think Jason, Jason Lemkin said that best. Would you want to buy from this person?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:15):
Can they sell you a pen?

Jen Abel (00:55:16):
The classic. Yeah, exactly. Do they mimic or mirror the market they're selling to? It's much easier to buy from someone that looks and feels like you than it does from somebody that's in a totally different realm. And also, an executive wants to talk to another senior person.

(00:55:41):
They don't want to talk to someone that just graduated from college and is selling them the new way of working. What do they know? So I think it's tricky. I would say someone with no sales experience makes it feel different and special, that's what I like about it. Someone with sales experience knows how to navigate and probably be qualified better, but it's almost like the blend of those two things.

(00:56:05):
And that's why I go back to cosplaying the founder, which is like, could this person close a future employee? Do they get excited about the problems they're solving internally and the vision that they get to sell to?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:19):
This actually was a reader question, listener question from Twitter. So Peter Dedenne asked, "How do you make this first salesperson as enthusiastic about the product as you? Is there something you could do? Is it more just they already are and you just leverage that?"

Jen Abel (00:56:36):
Incentives. Salespeople love to make money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:40):
Easy.

Jen Abel (00:56:42):
So if they know it's possible, if they know it's possible, you'll be shocked what people can get done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
If they see how much they could make. Amazing. I imagine there still also has to be an innate excitement about the product and the opportunity.

Jen Abel (00:56:58):
They have to believe in it. They have to believe in the founder, but incentives usually make the world go round, but yeah, is this person, are they asking the right questions to the founder? The best thing to do is have the founder join the first five calls. You know after five calls if this person has what it takes, and don't be afraid to fire. One in every two salespeople usually are fired. Yeah, it's a very high failure rate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:33):
Because you can tell pretty quickly how it's going.

Jen Abel (00:57:35):
You can tell, or the vision of the founders is just very wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
Speaking of incentives, do you have any quick advice on how to structure their comp? Just like how much they earn?

Jen Abel (00:57:45):
It's usually 50/50. So it's 50% OTE. So it's 50% base salary, 50% OTE.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:53):
And then how much of the sale do they typically get? Say the first sales hire.

Jen Abel (00:57:57):
It depends on the size of the deal, but in technology, it could be anywhere between eight and 12%. So rounds out around 10%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):
Okay. Awesome. When do you hire the first salesperson? Is it around the 1 million ARR mark usually?

Jen Abel (00:58:13):
Yeah, it's around that 1 million ARR, mark and I, and it's usually when you have your first seven to 10 customers and there's some pattern recognition around it that you can share with somebody else, there's some consistencies. Otherwise, it's just like that would be very hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):
Basically as a founder, you have to figure out how to sell enough times so that you can show someone, "Here's what's working."

Jen Abel (00:58:40):
And this is the common thing I hear, "Well, I'm a $10 million business. I'm in this small business space. You're $0 in enterprise." It's a zero to one right now in enterprise. It's a totally different game. It's a different value proposition, it's a different deal structuring, it's a different target market. It's a different risk tolerance. It's totally different. So don't be blindsided when-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):
It doesn't work.

Jen Abel (00:59:08):
... There's a lot of unlearning that needs to happen when you move into a new market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
So the advice here is make yourself sell up until around a million ARR, especially if you're trying to go enterprise selling to enterprises yourself as a founder, which is really hard. You have so much to do and you have to be selling this thing for a long time time.

Jen Abel (00:59:26):
Yep. And then try and find someone that you get excited by. It's funny, if you ask the founder, are you excited by your salesperson? I'm curious what the real answer is. It's like, "Well, it's a button to see it in. It was hard to hire, so."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):
Interesting. I remember, I think it was Jason's advice was to hire two people immediately.

Jen Abel (00:59:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
So you can compare them. Do you agree with that?

Jen Abel (00:59:48):
100%. Yeah, because of the 50% failure rate. I think that's exactly right. So yeah, even a tall order, go find two people that are good. But yeah, I think that that's right because one in two will fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:02):
Okay, let me ask you another reader question from Hang Huang. This is kind of in a different direction. So he says, "The biggest challenge is always cutting through the noise to get that initial meeting with the right decision maker. How do you even get their attention?"

Jen Abel (01:00:15):
It's the vision. What is the opportunity that you're selling? That if they are excited by that, they will take a call. I see it all the time, and don't give away the farm. Keep it to three sentences. And I know I said this on our first call, but say something counterintuitive, they could feel different. Make it feel like they can learn from you by taking a 15-minute call. You see the standards of like, "Oh, I came across your LinkedIn." And, "Are you looking to grow your business by 15%?" It's like, "What kind of statement is that?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):
And this is in the cold email they get about this pitch.

Jen Abel (01:00:56):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:56):
Awesome. So this is a good segue to another reader question from Hugo Alves, Co-Founder of Synthetic users. He asked, "What's the best advice for going from healthy inbound to targeted outbound?"

Jen Abel (01:01:07):
Healthy inbound usually is a marketing-led initiative. So that's a marketing game. It depends what deal value you're selling. Are you selling a $5,000 deal? It's got to be marketing-led to make the engine work. If you're selling $100,000 deal, you're doing outbound day one. So again, it breaks it into those. This is like that blending of the, I see a blending of that question. This is where you're doing small business marketing-led activities or are you a sales-led organization selling a $100,000 deal?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:40):
And the reason that's important, just in case it's not obvious, is you're not going to make money if you're selling. People are spending time closing deals that are making 10, 20K. Just the ROI on that won't work for your business model.

Jen Abel (01:01:51):
That's right. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:53):
Awesome. By the way, let me just say, Jen, this is an incredible conversation already. We've gone-

Jen Abel (01:01:57):
Oh this awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):
... Through so much. This is exactly what I was hoping to get through and we've gone through so much advice that I think is going to be so helpful to so many people. There's a few things that your partner, Justin also suggested I ask you about that I want to touch on. One is you have this question you ask founders a lot that opens up their mind. You ask them, "If you give your product away for free, would people even use this?" And every founder is like, "Of course." And then you ask, "A customer this?" And they're like, "Nah, we wouldn't use this." And that just blows their mind. Talk about just the power of that and how you recommend people approach this.

Jen Abel (01:02:33):
I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call, I'll say, "Honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year? Is it possible?" They'll give you the real answer and people are afraid to ask. But the other side is sort of if they're in it with you, they don't care about that question, right?

(01:03:01):
Can't ask that question on day one, but if you are, and we didn't talk about this, but maybe this is important. Every single enterprise deal I have done, the deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text. It's not on email anymore. It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately or I'm responding them to immediately because that builds so much trust.

(01:03:31):
If they know they can call on you, they're going to get you to pick up and they know that you're going to do everything humanly possible to make sure that this is successful. People will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, it's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible? And she's like, it's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it.

(01:04:00):
These are how enterprise deals gets done, it's relationships and it's this, and this is why I'm saying structuring the deal, make it feel like you went to bat for them and in often cases, you are going to bat for them and structure it in a way that makes sense for them. Everyone kind of just tries and pigeonhole. Pigeonholing and deal structuring consistency is important for a $10,000, sub-$10,000 deal. A $100,000 deal, it very commonly will look different every time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
April Dunford was on the podcast and she shared this really interesting insight that the reason people behave this way is the person at the company buying this thing, their ass is on the line Also, their reputation is on the line for this thing to work out. So they want it to go really well.

Jen Abel (01:04:45):
That's right. Again, they do this one in every three years, one in every two years, maybe one in every five years. Hell, I don't know. They don't do this every year. It's very rare. It's no one likes a new tool. No one. Not you, not me, unless it changes everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:05):
Yeah. Figma was a great example, that's Slack.

Jen Abel (01:05:08):
Everything you've touched

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:10):
Everything that worked out. You said that you asked these questions that people are afraid to ask. What are some other examples of questions you often ask that people are afraid to ask?

Jen Abel (01:05:20):
I will say, "Listen, this is $150,000 engagement. I will co-author it with you where we can make this a little bit bigger if you need something else. We can make it a little bit smaller in year one, but in year two it steps up. How do we get this done so when you go to bat, it's a win?" Sell them, do they take it to the wrong side and try and discount you? I've actually never seen that because at that point you have a relationship.

(01:05:51):
So co-authoring the pricing is so important because they need to know that they go to bat, they can say, "I got this out of them. If we get this deal done." So this is why when I say every deal looks the same, you're asking great questions because it's explaining why I meant by that, but this is another example of why every deal in the enterprise sort of looks somewhat different because a lot of it is co-authored. So again, if someone wants a slightly lower price, give it to them, but maybe them lock them in a little bit longer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):
There's another point that Justin makes that you've touched on a bit, but it's when your no, the way he phrased it is, Jen always talks about how no is the best answer to yes because no is data that you can use. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (01:06:38):
I am a qualification crazy person. I will not get in on another call with someone because on the first call it's either a yes or a no, there's no in between. Humans are, we're so different and we're so unpredictable, but we're also so predictable at the same time, right? It's very obvious if someone is excited and wants to do something, it is so obvious when someone is just trying to be nice.

(01:07:06):
So I will say to them on that call, "I'm sort of getting the vibe that this might not be a good fit or might not be good timing. Did I misinterpret that?" And they will usually say, "Yeah, you're right, it's probably not a good fit." And then immediately, "Great, I would love to stay in touch. You've just saved a relationship and you've just saved yourself a ton of time."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
And the implication here is just to your point, you're limited on time. You don't want to be spending time going down or rival that won't you anywhere.

Jen Abel (01:07:24):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:33):
I'm going to take a quick tangent on tools. What's the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling?

Jen Abel (01:07:39):
I don't use a tool because I believe in the manual and I'll explain why. Every single note I send is slightly different because I see a picture of them and I'm like, "Oh, I don't know if that's going to land." Or I'm like, "Oh, they actually might appreciate this. It's weird." Visual cues are so helpful. A picture is a visual cue, looking at how long they've been in the role, looking how long they've been at the company.

(01:08:05):
I use all of these little things and I seldom customize a note in a way that people expect which is that first customized sentence because AI does that, and everyone's doing that. So I go the opposite extreme, which is like remove it and I customize it with how I frame it or the subject line. So it's like if I'm talking to someone like a peer, I might say quick question like QQ.

(01:08:36):
If I'm talking to someone that has a bit more experience, I might write a little bit of a tighter note, not all lowercase. So it just depends on who you're speaking to. And again, this is why it's okay to spend a little bit of time on this because it's a hundred thousand dollars. It's actually a million dollars at the end of the day because a $100,000 deal if you play your cards right turns into a million dollar deal over three to five years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
I love how much you enjoy this. It's so fun to, so essentially what are you doing? You're sitting on LinkedIn finding folks to ping and then you cold email them one individually, manually.

Jen Abel (01:09:13):
It's so weird, Lenny, I have no process. I kind of just go with the vibe. I'll read an article about Tesla and I'm like, "Huh, they could be interested in this." Not because that article had anything to do with the problem I'm solving, but because I'm like, "This feels like a good Tesla day." It's hard to describe. It's a very emotional thing for me, and not to toot my own horn, obviously, but I've been successful in sales and the most successful sales people can't explain why they're good at it.

(01:09:51):
It just comes to them naturally. It's just like an emotional thing. It's like the world's best founders. How do you be a good founder? It's very, very hard to define. How do you become a good engineer? Very, very hard to define. So I don't believe in playbooks. I believe that there's a feel to it. I emailed a chief legal officer at a hedge fund once and he responded to me because I wrote to him on Saturday. I knew it was going to be busy. I made it one sentence and it was tweaked for him.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:29):
Do you feel like this is going to be the way as AI SDRs just kind of take over and everyone's getting billions of emails that feel AI-ish?

Jen Abel (01:10:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
So I guess maybe speak more there. Just like is the alpha essentially just become human? Don't automate? Should you think you should?

Jen Abel (01:10:49):
The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. So I'm like, "I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is trick-or-treating."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:04):
And this is effective for very large deal, which is what you need to be doing anyway because it takes a lot of time to do it this way.

Jen Abel (01:11:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:12):
Interesting. So you're not like sitting in Clay, you're not like Apollo, I don't have all those tools. You're just finding people yourself.

Jen Abel (01:11:19):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Do you start with a target prospect list at least just like, "Here's the companies that are the perfect fit for this and let's work through them."

Jen Abel (01:11:30):
It's all in my brain. I've been doing this for so long, I have in my brain, I'm like, these are my early adopters. These who I'm going to go to after I close those logos, they get excited by those logos. So it's just experience of you land a Walmart, you're going to go to the rest of the industry and say, "Hey, we're working with Walmart." Versus you go to some lower end enterprise company and they're like, "Wait, what do you do?" I can't even comprehend.

(01:12:02):
Also, the most strategic people, some of the most strategic executives are at these tier one logos. That's why they're tier one because they've got super smart, really capable folks. They also extract the best talent, the best talent likes to experiment and continue to improve. So it's like this compounding thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:20):
For someone that isn't Jen and has all this experience, say their founder, they're hit a million ARR. They're just like, "Okay, where do we find our customers?" Do you have any advice for just coming up with who we should go after? Should they be using these tools? Should they be hiring someone like a Jen? I know this is what you do for companies. So one crowd is go hire JJELLYFISH to help them through this.

Jen Abel (01:12:39):
Founder, the founder. I would say the founder, this is sort of in tune with them in a way. They just have to find it. It's so weird to say it's all, and I hate saying it because it's like a commonplace thing to say, but it's like there's this thing about flow and it's like some of these brands are in flow with you right now, right? You found this insight from somewhere. Who else? What's the next adjacent ring of people that would buy into that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:21):
And so what I'm hearing is just pay attention to what's happening, what companies are-

Jen Abel (01:13:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:25):
The news, what companies are doing interesting things, who are the kind of early adopters in the market.

Jen Abel (01:13:29):
If it was just a database list and it was just about figuring out the right messaging and then emailing folks, we would've known by that by now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:39):
That's so interesting. Okay, maybe one more question. This again is from Justin. He shares that when you hit resistance, you never argue, you reframe. If someone says, "We already have X solution, you'll agree and pivot and totally X is great for this thing, but here's what we can do."

Jen Abel (01:13:55):
This is why it's sell to the alpha. Hey, I know. Listen, that problem you just described, you're right. You have a tool for that. We're taking you much further upstream with value. This is the opportunity I want you guys to have access to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:08):
I love it, Jen. I've gone through everything I was hoping to get through. On the other hand, I feel like we could do another hour on all these things, I feel like we need to do.

Jen Abel (01:14:17):
We have three.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:19):
Yeah, we need round three on the next phase and all the things that people want to dig further into. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or share?

Jen Abel (01:14:30):
This stuff is really hard. It's very hard. Sales is also all about learning very, very quickly from the rejection. The rejection is good because it's a forced learning and you never want to go through that again, but you have to be, I don't like to use the word cringe. You can't be afraid to cringe is like bringing your AI recorder into a call, that's cringey, but sending 15 notes to people that you can deliver serious value to, don't be afraid, and don't be afraid to ask the hard questions. Be different.

(01:15:12):
The whole game is about, "Oh, this feels different. That's what people want access to." Yet everyone commoditizes themselves. They try and mimic what everyone, they try and mimic a forward deployed engineer. Just rename it. You don't have to use the same nomenclature. Everyone gets excited by the new because the new could be the next thing, the thing that changes it all. So that's why I'm always like, "Don't be better. Be different."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:40):
An amazing way to end it. With that, Jen, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Jen Abel (01:15:48):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:48):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Jen Abel (01:15:54):
I do Twitter accounts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):
Oh, Twitter accounts to follow? Oh, amazing.

Jen Abel (01:15:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:58):
Okay.

Jen Abel (01:16:00):
Lenny, the day I have time to read a book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:03):
Period.

Jen Abel (01:16:05):
Period. I would love to be reading books.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:10):
Cool. Twitter accounts to follow. Tell me.

Jen Abel (01:16:11):
Yeah. Look, obviously you, you produce some of the best content, truthfully,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:16):
Appreciate it.

Jen Abel (01:16:18):
You get into the minds of people that they're not even giving this insight on Twitter. Who else do I absolutely love? Jason Lemkin. So for sales, Jason Lemkin is awesome, awesome follow for sales, and also he had a great, great recording with you. So link to that because that was a great piece. I actually learned a ton from Matt. I love Gavin Baker. Super nuanced takes. Takes a lot of obvious statements, but shares a lot of the non-obvious insight. He's great. Jason Cohen, have you ever had Jason Cohen on the cast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):
Jason Cohen, a Smart Bear Jason Cohen?

Jen Abel (01:17:00):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:00):
He's coming on the podcast at the end of the year or something.

Jen Abel (01:17:05):
Oh, that's awesome. What a great plug for him right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):
Yes.

Jen Abel (01:17:08):
Yeah, those three would be great. I know they're all men, but.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
Great tips.

Jen Abel (01:17:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:12):
Next question, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed? I know you said you have time to read.

Jen Abel (01:17:18):
This is going to be embarrassing, Baywatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:22):
Baywatch.

Jen Abel (01:17:22):
Yeah. Baywatch channel. It's just so Numby, and it's like '90s classic. Baywatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:30):
Wow, I've never heard that one before. So this is original Baywatch with?

Jen Abel (01:17:34):
This is original Hasselhoff. David Hasselhoff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):
Yeah, Pamela Anderson.

Jen Abel (01:17:39):
Yasmine Bleeth. Pamela Anderson, the original cast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:41):
Amazing.

Jen Abel (01:17:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):
Okay. Deep cut. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Jen Abel (01:17:47):
So the number one thing for me right now is an app called Playground, which is the pictures of my toddler that they upload into the preschool so I can get the daily updates on what's going on in preschool when he's not home.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):
Amazing. I need that. We get emails and Google Photos. I would really love that.

Jen Abel (01:18:09):
Yeah, there was another one called ClassDojo. There's a few of them, but Playground is the one that this preschool's on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
Love ClassDojo. I'm a small investor.

Jen Abel (01:18:17):
Are you really?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:18):
I am.

Jen Abel (01:18:18):
Oh, that's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):
How about that? Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to find useful in work or in life?

Jen Abel (01:18:26):
Yeah, be direct. Cut the fluff. Give me the bullet, not the paragraph.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):
Final question. I was told that by Justin that you've never read a sales book. You've just learned to do this. If you were to read a sales book, if there was someone else out there that you look up to, learn from, is there anyone else out there in the world of sales that you most respect?

Jen Abel (01:18:51):
I think Jason Lemkin has the strongest understanding of sales. His content is unbelievable. He speaks about it clearly and cleanly, I would say. And as I mentioned, unbelievable Twitter follow. I'm a big fan of his.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):
Awesome.

Jen Abel (01:19:06):
I've actually learned a lot from him too. The 50/50 thing or a higher two salespeople, he's spot on. Failure rate is actually probably higher than 50%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:15):
I love that guy. And he's so AI-forward these days. He's just building. He almost took down Replit with his complaints. It was a whole new cycle of how Replit-

Jen Abel (01:19:24):
He should interact. Sometimes he says things that are harsh, but you're like, "He's not wrong."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:31):
Love it. I got to get him back on the podcast.

Jen Abel (01:19:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:33):
Jen, this was incredible. This was everything I wanted to be. I feel like we just leveled up all the founders that have listened to this in their ability to close. We're going to just create all the economic value and a lot of happy VCs from all the sales that will be closed as a result of the advice you shared. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to either work with you or follow you online? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jen Abel (01:19:54):
Twitter. Every new learning or mishap, I put red on Twitter, so it's like my personal diary and super responsive on Twitter DM.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:06):
What's your Twitter handle? Twitter handle.

Jen Abel (01:20:08):
It's double J, So J-J-E-N_A-B-E-L.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:15):
You did not make that easy for people to find you, but we-

Jen Abel (01:20:17):
Yeah, I know, I know, I know I didn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:20):
And the J is for JJELLYFISH, is that where the extra J is for?

Jen Abel (01:20:23):
Yeah, the double Js. Then also, well, someone else had the handle, so I was like, "I need my name."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Got it. By the way, just tell people what JJELLYFISH is in case that might be helpful to them.

Jen Abel (01:20:30):
Yeah, so it's a consultancy that helps folks in the zero to one stage, and now I'm at general manager of enterprise at State Affairs, which is basically giving citizens and corporations an inside peek into what's actually going on inside the state capitol building. State policy is way more impact than on you, than federal policy. Federal policy is written more about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:54):
Incredible. I've only recently learned that that's what you're doing these days, and that is super impactful and important, so thank you for your work there.

Jen Abel (01:21:02):
Even democracy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:04):
No big deal. Jen, thank you so much for being here.

Jen Abel (01:21:06):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was a blast.

# Moving fast and navigating uncertainty | Jeremy Henrickson (Rippling, Coinbase)

## Transcript

Jeremy Henrickson (00:00:00):
It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, "Hey, you take that hill over there. You guys do this over here." When in fact, where you really learn where the challenges are, or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated. And so I try to do that as often as I can, and I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise.

Lenny (00:00:32):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, for interview world-class product leaders and growth experts, to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jeremy Henrickson. Jeremy is senior vice president of product at Rippling, where he leads the product and design teams. Previously, he was chief product officer at Coinbase where he oversaw 10 x growth of the product and engineering organizations and helped scale Coinbase during one of the craziest times in the crypto markets. In our conversation, Jeremy shares his lessons about maintaining velocity at scale, creating a culture of fast decision-making, the importance of product leaders going deep on a problem, and becoming world experts at their domain. What to look for in product managers you're interviewing, why relying on frameworks can be so detrimental to your success, why you may want to avoid MVPs and instead designed for the most complex use cases first, and tons more. Enjoy this episode with Jeremy Henrickson after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:27):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours.

Jeremy, welcome to the podcast.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:03:30):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:32):
So I've heard nothing but amazing things about you and I'm excited to learn from what you've learned from your experience at Rippling, at Coinbase, and all of the products and teams that you've built. And so thank you again for being here.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:03:45):
Yeah, super happy to be here.

Lenny (00:03:46):
So I want to start with your time at Coinbase where you were chief product officer and you were chief product officer during maybe the craziest time in the crypto markets. It was I think 2016, 2018 when I was looking at the Bitcoin prices and it was like it went from a $1000 to $20,000 I think in a matter of months. So I'm curious, what was that experience like, and in particular, what was like leading a product team through that experience?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:04:11):
The strongest memories for me are during 2017 where crypto, which had kind of been at its nadir in early 2016 and slowly started climbing out, just kind of took off and became a real thing in the public consciousness. And Coinbase, which at the time had an exchange just like on-ramp and off-ramp from fiat to crypto and back experienced over the course of 2017 40 x growth in usage.

Lenny (00:04:39):
That's like a dream come true for a lot of people.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:04:42):
No, I mean it was both a dream and a nightmare and I was incredibly lucky to be working on it with a team of people that I could really trust and could stand shoulder-to-shoulder within the trenches. And it was a lot of learning about how you can rapidly scale systems over time and people like to trade crypto on Saturday mornings, so a lot of Saturday mornings just some new thing would break on the edges of the system and we need to get in there and work on it. And so it was just a lot of really incredible lessons about who you choose to work with and focus and making sure you have the right people in the room at the right time.

Lenny (00:05:25):
Okay. So let's actually unpack a couple of those. So focus is really interesting and something people always talk about, but hard to actually do. I guess how did you keep the team focused? I imagine just everyone's getting rich all over the place in crypto.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:05:39):
Huh.

Lenny (00:05:39):
Things are breaking all the time, like how did you maintain focus on your team?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:05:43):
Well, the first thing is you don't talk about people getting rich. It's a very technical, you talk about like its customers, it's their money, and number one, it had to be secure. So there's a guy named Philip Barton, a friend of mine now, and he is just this amazing security leader at Coinbase, and he was able to always put these decisions that we were making extremely quickly in context and say, "Look, these are the kinds of decisions we can make and still have it be secure no matter how fast we need to move." And so security was always the number one thing. And then the second thing is focusing on both the kind of immediate nature of the issue. Hey, site is down or whatever, and resolving that, but also trying to set those in a context of where we need to go over the next six months. What are we actually shooting for? What do we believe the volumes are going to be? What's it going to take to have everything from a user experience to the deep back end of the product that what would actually work for them?

Lenny (00:06:41):
What was maybe the biggest challenge as a product leader trying to keep people focused and everything on the rails as things were going 40 x?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:06:50):
I think the biggest challenge was that in crypto there's just so much uncertainty in general, simple questions like, is Ethereum going to be a thing, are the subject of debate. And no one actually at the time had an answer to that question. Lots of really strong opinions and so you have to be able to have those debates because lots is going on, but then you have to be able to come out of those conversations with a clear kind of company point of view that you're all shooting toward. And while there may still be differing points of views and debates that happen on the margins, you go full speed toward this answer until you decide to go full speed toward a different answer. And I thought we were pretty successful at that at Coinbase and it wasn't always easy.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Maybe just a last question there.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:07:34):
Sure.

Lenny (00:07:34):
Living through a time like that, a lot of people are going through these periods of just intense work and it's like, holy moly, this isn't crazy stressful working, like incredibly long hours, but then you look back at those times, and end up being some most important meaningful periods of your career.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:07:50):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:07:52):
I guess one is that, is that your experience too? And then two, I guess is there any advice for someone that's maybe going through something like that of just here's maybe the silver lining of being in a period like that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:08:03):
So it's hard, right? It wasn't always easy. I had a new daughter who had been born just a few months earlier, really tough to balance those things, but I've always loved the rate of learning. And so it is those experiences I feel that have most sort of accelerated my own personal growth and personal learnings because it's in the crucible of things being hard. And so I think when people are going through those times, it's nice to take a step back and talk with friends or whatever about what's really going on and setting it in the context of, hey, three, four or five years now from now when we look back on this, you realize, wow. A, we did something amazing with that time. And B, we learned a lot and we were able to take that with us into whatever we were doing next after that.

Lenny (00:08:52):
Before our chat, I'd asked you what people ask you for advice most around, and you said that people often ask you for advice on how to maintain velocity at scale, which is something every founder and product leader is always striving to do. And so what have you learned and what do you tell people about maintaining and maybe even improving velocity as you scale?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:09:12):
I think there's a lot of different answers here, and I think a lot of them are very specific to the nature of the business that someone's in, like different businesses can maintain velocity in different ways. I think there's kind of a universal truth that you want small teams with clear missions. Right? If there's 300 people trying to work on one thing, the just sheer communication challenges, Dunbar's number, all of those things come into play and it's really, really hard to act quickly. And so having smaller groups of people breaking down what is always a very, very large problem into sufficiently small bits that small groups can attack wholeheartedly and minimize horizontal communication, I think is the first thing. I think the second thing is that to the extent it's like a technology problem. The more you can bake into a clear platform, it reduces the decision-making complexity for everyone who's working on the domain part of the problem.

(00:10:09):
And so a clear like a platform with a clear interface [inaudible 00:10:12] easy to use in all the ways that both engineers and product people want it to be easy to use, simplifies the space in which people have to think about these problems. And that's not always easy. Platforms are not, you can't just write a platform and hope it's going to work for the products. It's very much an iterative thing, but the more one can invest in that and have the right kinds of people who are capable of doing that sort of both systems thinking and product thinking simultaneously, I think is really important. The third thing, just from a leadership point of view is diving deep. Right? It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, "Hey, you take that hill over there, you guys do this over here." When in fact where you really learn where the challenges are or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated.

(00:11:05):
And so I try to do that as often as I can. And I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise. And I think the last thing is it's just making sure that teams have the right distribution of experience and seniority. Sometimes you get a team started and the team is perhaps doing something that's zero-to-one and they're amazing at all this zero-to-one stuff.

(00:11:28):
And then two or three years later, those same people are trying to scale the product to millions of people and it turns out that A, they don't like that part of the job as much, and B, maybe they're not as good at it. So I think you [inaudible 00:11:40] constantly look at the team and make sure that a people are doing things that they love and if they're not like, Hey, we've tried this other thing instead and recalibrate the team and make sure the right kind of skill sets are there. And I found if you do all of those things and then have product leadership where we're saying this is what we need to do and very, very clear and precise on what needs to be done, then you can usually actually even accelerate over time because you bake more into this platform, it allows your engineers to do more with less, and that's always pretty amazing.

Lenny (00:12:07):
Okay, let me dig into a couple of these. These are really great.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:12:10):
[inaudible 00:12:10] please.

Lenny (00:12:12):
So with the small teams with clear missions, is there an example of that at Rippling or Coinbase where that was a really good example of this being true?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:12:20):
One example is maybe three years ago when I was just starting at the company, we decided that we needed to build a time and attendance product, lots of market demand for us and that we hadn't built it yet, something that many customers need. And so there were a bunch of ways we could have chosen to do that, but the way we did it was to say, look, let's find one engineer, really talented systems engineer who's actually capable of doing kind of product thinking and have Parker, CEO also spend time on it. And you start there and Sachit brought a few people on with him.

(00:12:56):
And those four people over the course of maybe nine months or so, built a time and attendance product. It was the only thing they were doing. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with our payroll product except to the extent they had to integrate with them a little bit. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with the benefits team or our IT products. They were monomaniacally focused on this one thing and then identifying the places where yes, you, there's connectivity to the rest of the suite, and that allowed them to move extremely quickly.

Lenny (00:13:24):
How much of that was Parker being on the team, helping them unblock everything versus being very small and focused?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:13:30):
I think it was mostly small and focused. Obviously, Parker can do things and unblock them in the way that only a CEO can and that helps. But the thing is at Rippling, like we've now replicated that a dozen times. That's our model for starting new things. And so it can't just be him unblocking things, though he does unblock things. It's more that this pattern of having these small groups be able to do things and then being able to have go to those people, whether you're Parker or somebody else in the company, and be able to say, Hey, how are things going? Or are we working on the right things? Or let's see the latest designs for that thing and comment on it.

(00:14:05):
All of those things can happen just at a much greater tempo than if you're trying to go three layers down into the org and do things. I think that's the other, maybe the key point here that everyone is exposed senior leadership, yes, we have a management structure because you have to, but that management structure does not interfere with the ability of anyone anywhere in the organization to look at what's actually happening. And that happens very directly.

Lenny (00:14:29):
So let's talk about that model you just described. So what is that model? So this is how you approach new products, and I know within Rippling there's many, many products and features we're going to talk about this. And you're saying that you have kind of an approach to adding a new business unit essentially, or a new product feature.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:14:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:43):
What is that model roughly?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:14:45):
Yeah, so the model's quite simple. In the vast majority of cases, we realize we need to build something and we have the one-page view of what that is. And usually, we're lucky enough that the things we're building sort of exist in some form in the industry today, not in the differentiated way that we can build it, but time and attendance is an example. That's a well-known thing in the industry. There's whole companies that do only that, right? So we start there, we find a single engineer who is extremely entrepreneurial, understands what it means to operate at tempo, understands what it means to make decisions with low information, understands how to work very, very quickly with a design partner.

(00:15:22):
So we have a design partner and we say, "Look, come into Rippling, spend a few months getting to know the platform first of all. So go work on this other team, understand what's easy for them, what's hard for them, how the platform works, how other products have been built on top of this. Go talk with other people who founded products here and understand what their experience is so that you can learn from and iterate on it, get an opinion about your product, and then start building it."

(00:15:48):
And during this intervening time, they're also recruiting a team of usually 2, 3, 4 other engineers who kind of have that same zero-to-one mentality and they start building. And usually over the course of six to nine months, we can get a product from a blank sheet of paper to something that is launched or at least that we're using internally when we dogfood our stuff really heavily. And then it grows from there. And then sometimes when you launch one of these products, you get close to launch, you realize, hey, actually a team of five or six people can handle this product ad nauseam. Sometimes you have to bump it up. It's like, okay, this thing's about to go to production, there's all these other things to do, the team needs now needs to go from 4 to 15 or something like that. Really depends on the product, but that's the general life cycle and then you keep growing and scaling it.

Lenny (00:16:34):
That is fascinating. So just so I understand, you find a founder type to take the lead on a new idea and do you recruit them internally or you sometimes find them externally just to focus on this product?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):
Both.

Lenny (00:16:34):
Interesting.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):
Both.

Lenny (00:16:46):
Okay. And then you find a design partner for them to work with to figure out what exactly needs to be built. And is it idea pick one design partner or you try to encourage a few?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:57):
Usually, it's one. So there's a designer, so we have a design-

Lenny (00:17:00):
Oh, design partner, meaning a designer, not a company that is like their partner in design.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:17:06):
Oh, no, no, no. Literally, somebody who knows Rippling's products, knows our component library, knows all of that stuff and is skilled and doing UX and interaction and visual design.

Lenny (00:17:19):
Got it. Okay, design. Okay, cool. And then they basically with maybe a couple engineers, just that's the team that initiates a new product line and then launches it, and then as it scales, it maybe grows the team, maybe not.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:17:33):
Yep, that's right. And it's pretty ad hoc, but every couple of weeks or something like that, they're meeting with me or with Parker or whichever one of us is the DRI on it and giving feedback on the designs, having a critical life or like "Oh man, if I were using this as a admin, a small company or an admin at a large company, how would I feel about this? Would this interface work for me?" And so we were pressure testing it throughout that cycle and trying to get the balance of speed and comprehensiveness, right.

Lenny (00:18:03):
This reminds me you're also, I hear not a big fan of MVPs that you building products to further point. Is that true? And then if so, how do you think about the initial version of a product?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:18:16):
First of all, I don't want to knock on MVPs. I think MVPs have their place extremely useful, particularly if you're literally the zero-to-one company that's never done anything before and you don't have clear market validation. I think in our case specifically for Rippling, a minimum viable product would do a disservice to both our customers and to the very team that was building it. And the reason I believe that is that when you design a minimum viable product, you're optimizing for speed. And in that set of optimizations, you are minimizing the deeper product thinking about what can fully differentiate our product based on not only existing kind of capabilities within our products and platform, but based on what it ought to do in the future.

(00:19:03):
And so it sort of limits product creativity, but worse, it leads to building the wrong thing technically, right? So if you're only thinking through the simple cases and you're an engineer and no one's pushing you on saying, "Wait, what about that healthcare hospital administration case where it's mission-critical life," then you're going to make a different set of as architectural assumptions, and then you're going to build on those and you're going to build on those for six months, nine months a year, and you'll have dozens or 100s of assumptions built on top of those.

(00:19:38):
And it's extremely difficult to unwind those decisions once you've built them into the product. And therefore we believe very deeply it's like, sure, understand those simple cases. Understand if you're a two-person company, you don't need all of these other things. And what is the product going to look like for you to approach it but also understand what it would mean to have 10,000 people globally around the world with this ridiculously hard use case? What's the model that would support that? And let's make sure that as we're doing the technical and product design for this thing, that it accommodates that view, even if we're not going to support it in the first version, even if we make the product decision to say, "Look, we actually don't need to handle that case right now." You still build the product in a way that's not going to prevent you from getting there in the future. And does that take a little more time? Sure, yeah. But does it save you time in the long run? Absolutely. Right. And so that's our approach.

Lenny (00:20:39):
Is there an example that comes to mind of a product you build at Rippling or Coinbase of just, it could have been this really simple MVP and then ended up being like, no, we did the right thing by building it further along the spectrum.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:20:49):
Yeah. So I think a great example of this at Rippling is our global payroll product. We could have said, "Hey, look, we just need to support this one country. We need to support, whatever, the UK," let's say. So we're going to copy all of our US stuff, just replicate it and change all the things to be UK-like. That would've been the fastest thing to do to dramatically oversimplify, but that's not what we did. What we did is we said, look, we need to launch a six countries and these are six super different countries that we want to look at. And they're going to have different requirements from an HRIS standpoint, from an employer of record standpoint, from how you pay global contractors, from how payroll works, and we're going to make a system that works for those countries. And there's lots of downstream implications for that.

(00:21:39):
But what it means is that now our global payroll system, adding a country is, it's not easy, but it's a lot easier than it would've been if you had to continue to stamp out and replicate and then of course maintain all of these things that have very little underlying connectivity. And instead, what we have is 80% of the system is baked into our global payroll platform, and then the 20% is country-specific. And most of that specificity can be handled not by engineers who are very, very expensive to change things that are local specific, but instead can be configured by somebody that's in compliance, by somebody that's in legal that needs to get the right documents into the system. And all of that stuff can be handled by the system, which allows us to move much faster sort of going forward.

Lenny (00:22:27):
I've heard you describe this kind of idea as you encourage teams to design for the most complex use case first.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:22:27):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:32):
Is that kind of the instruction you give these teams?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:22:35):
100%, many times. And so it's one of these things that until you're here, it's a really difficult thing to kind of grok because A, it's so counterculture to what the background that most people have come from. It's like, no, no, no, don't think about all those things. Just zoom in on this one case, use it as a wedge, and then grow from there. And this is one of the reasons that we have people, especially new people in these kind of founding roles, come in and spend a few months just absorbing the culture to really learn these lessons. And it's one reason that we're extremely high touch with kind of new products in their infancy to make sure that we just don't fall into that trap, right? Especially because simultaneously with doing this, we're like, "Hey, but we need to ship this as fast as possible." Right? And so you want to get the balance of those two things right.

Lenny (00:23:17):
So when I think about Rippling, I think of you got the culture is to do things the hard way and the right way. And an element of that is there's this concept that I've heard that Rippling is this compound startup? What does that term mean? And then how does that approach impact the way you build product and organize teams and all the things you were just talking about of MVPs and build new products?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:23:40):
The idea of a compound startup for us is that we're basically a lot of businesses that all work together. If you think about the products we offer, we have payroll, well, there's entire companies built just on payroll, insurance, and benefits, entire companies. That's our entire life. In fact, a fragment of benefits is the entire life cycle of a whole company. Our IT products, device management, and identity management, time and attendance, each of these things are industries into themselves with multi-billion dollar companies serving each of them. The insight Parker had before he founded the company was actually the result you get that when you have that is that there's all this data that gets replicated and copied and as impossible to keep in sync everywhere. The right answer is to have a single system of record, one place, one database where all of that information is resident so that each of these downstream systems can always have the right data at the right time.

(00:24:34):
And then you can build on top of that things like workflow and reporting and analytics and permissioning and all these kinds of underlying capabilities. So the idea of a compound startup is all of these different businesses benefit from being built on top of one platform. The activation energy for that is extremely high. So before my time at the company, Parker, Prasanna, the technical founder, and others, built all of the first versions of all these products and it was a minor miracle, they were able to do that. But having done it, we then had that platform and we could continue to build new verticals and new startups on top of that foundation.

Lenny (00:25:16):
This touches on something that comes up a number of times in this podcast, which is the importance of differentiation. And it feels like this is the differentiator for Rippling. It's not going to be just a better one of these vertical solutions like the main differentiators, we're going to do it all and everything's going to be so much better because it's all in one platform. Is that kind of where the original idea came from or is there a different way to think about that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:25:38):
Yeah, I think that's right. So I mean, the fundamental contention is having a single system of record is better for many, many, many reasons, right? The most simple of which is there's a single source of truth and all of these other products can rely on it. But also, unless you start without assumption of everything being in a single system of record, there's a bunch of other things you can't do. You can't build out a, I don't know, a permissioning system that looks at the various attributes across all of these products. You now suddenly have to do an integration and each of these products talks different languages. You can't do simple things, build a product and say, who is this person's manager? Most products, you can't do that. Most products you find some system of truth, export everybody's name and email address and a spreadsheet, have another email address or another name, maybe an employee ID of who that person reports to and upload that to another system, which by the way is immediately out of date because organizational structures change all the time.

(00:26:35):
Whereas with Rippling, it's always correct. We are the system of record. So all of our products, they're like, "Hey, who's that person's manager." And the system immediately knows. And that's a very, very simple example of something that you can only do if you start with solve it to come back to an earlier point, like solve the most complex use case first, solve the fact that this data all needs to be in the same place. And so our ability to differentiate boils down to that one fundamental decision, which just allows us to do things that are literally impossible for any other company to do.

Lenny (00:27:09):
What would you say is one of the most unique things about Ripplings culture that maybe you haven't mentioned yet?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:27:15):
I would say it's fundamental, speed of execution. I think in speed of decision-making. It's the thing that is probably the hardest to explain to people before they're here. It's hard to understand until you experience it. It's like let's not schedule a meeting for next week or tomorrow or later today. We're in the middle of a meeting, we need to make a decision. Let's either make the decision or if we can't, let's Slack call in the person that we need in order to make that decision. And we'll be done with the decision today.

(00:27:44):
And like sure there are irreversible decisions you can't make that way, but for the most part, we really value the tempo of decision-making and the speed of response. And no company I've been at any scale, 5 people, 5,000 people, has ever operated at the tempo this one does. And I think that our ability to continue to operate at that tempo, which is partly due to the fact that we are a compound startup and have these small teams independently operating teams and all the rest of that is a really differentiating thing about the culture of the company.

Lenny (00:28:14):
I'm reading Kevin Kelly's new book where I don't know if you've seen his new book. It's all these little tidbits of advice and one of his pieces of advice is that usually the best time to do something is right now. And that feels like that resonates with the way you all think. I'm curious just how you create that culture and ability to make decisions fast. Is it purely top-down founder, this is how they behave, or is there something else that you found as effective to create this culture of moving fast, making decisions really quickly?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:28:43):
Obviously, a huge piece of this is Parker himself. It's an attribute of his personality, he likes making decisions quickly, and it's also a deliberate strategic decision on his part to have a company that makes decisions quickly. And so he models this constantly, right, in Slack, in conversations in person, and in every way possible. And there's an expectation throughout the company. If you kind of look at our leadership principles, this ability to make decisions quickly is something that kind of everybody promulgates. But also I think there's a number of things we've done to bake it in the way that we even do say quarterly planning. And the fact that there's this timeline for decision-making that doesn't leave a lot of room in the way that we expect people to know their domains, especially in product, right?

(00:29:29):
In product, you don't own little feature, you own your product and you're expected to be the world's foremost expert in it. And if you are, what that means is instead of having to come back to people three days later with an answer, just off the top of your head, you can be like, "Yes, this is what I think I should do about that or give me 30 minutes, look something up and I can tell you what we need to do about that." And so all of those things in combination just yield an environment in which these decisions happen very quickly.

Lenny (00:29:55):
You talked about quarterly planning and you're saying that there's like, here's the timelines we need to make decisions on these dates, and there's a culture of just we stay firm to that. And if you don't, then we're going to move on.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:30:06):
That's right. And it's shocking to people when we actually move on, right, that haven't been here yet. It's like, no, no, that date passed. You don't get to retroactively make everybody react to the fact that you didn't operate quickly enough, right? And it's not a hostile thing, it's just a, people just have to get used to. It's a deep cultural principle. And the fact that everyone stands behind it just means it's gets reinforced on its own, out of its own gravity.

Lenny (00:30:34):
Do you have internal values that you've kind of outlined that are a part of this? Or is that not something that you find super valuable?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:30:42):
No, actually I find them quite valuable. And actually our COO, Matt MacInnis, who joined the company about a year before I did, he has been the one to really drive this and you go to, I can't remember this specific URL, but on Rippling there's a search Rippling leadership principles. There they are. And they are really true to the culture of the company. The way we came up with them was to us a couple years ago, to introspect and to what actually made people successful at the company? Like who's successful, why are they successful? Why do they enjoy being here? Or alternatively the opposite, like why people not worked out, why do some people not enjoy it here? And those are the things that are differentiating and those are the things that we wrote down.

Lenny (00:31:23):
Are you hiring or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity? Well, either way, check out lennysjobs.com/talent. If you're a hiring manager, you can sign up and get access to hundreds of hand-curated people who are open to new opportunities. Thousands of people apply to join this collective. And I personally review and accept just about 10% of them. You won't find a better place to hire product managers and growth leaders. Join almost a 100 other companies who are actively hiring through this collective. And if you're looking around for a newer opportunity actively or passively join the collective, it's free. You can be anonymous and you can even hide yourself from specific companies. You can also leave any time and you'll only hear from companies that you want to hear from. Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. For someone listening that's like, we need to move faster. And everyone always feels this, we need to move faster, we make decisions faster. What piece of advice would you give someone for helping them do this at their company?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:32:27):
I think it's really context-dependent, but I think it starts with whoever is in the role of making the top-level product decisions of them being one extremely clear about what those priorities are and more importantly, extremely clear about what all the priorities aren't. Right? There are so many things that could be important or people can make the case for being important or whatever that are fundamentally distracting from the core mission of getting something done.

(00:32:55):
But secondly, for that person to go all the way to ground on it, we have one of the leadership principles is go and see. Right? So to look at the thing and then walk all the way to ground and talk with the engineer who's writing the code on the thing. Because inevitably this top-level communication is insufficient to get to the detail of what matters and doesn't matter. And you don't have to do that everywhere, but if you do it in enough places, what it does is it creates a clear expectation of that kind of clarity across the board and forces everyone to up their game a little bit and just helps people understand what the expectation is. Right? And I think in the absence of those sort of clear expectations, it's difficult for people to perform at their best. Right? And so we try to do that pretty frequently.

Lenny (00:33:43):
Okay. I definitely want to spend more time on this, but before we get there, so go and see. I love that. And that actually has come up recently on a number of podcasts, just the importance of people continuing to ask questions and going to the end of what's possible. Recent story was IO talking about building the cash card and going to the warehouse and watching the printings of the cards and things like that.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:34:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:34:04):
I guess first of all, do you have a sense of where that came from and why that ended up being so important to y'all? And then two is there an example of you doing that or someone you've seen do that and that leading to something really important?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:34:16):
In the early days of our global efforts, when we were first trying to figure out what global payroll was, it was really tempting to say, "Oh, well we're going to go into the UK and that's going to be relatively similar to what we're doing in the US." But our kind of head of payroll went in and said, actually, here are the ways in which we knew it was going to be different, but here are the ways in which we didn't anticipate that it was going to be different, which made us realize that we had to completely alter our approach for how we think about learning about each of these countries and going into them and having a fulsome experience.

(00:34:50):
And that then backs into things like, well, every country does tax filings, every country does them slightly differently, but how are we going to build a tax filing system that's going to allow us to satisfy the needs of every country in which we're going to run payroll? And it was only through that very early on deep look at how one country was actually operating and then doing the same thing with the next country that we were able to set in motion, all of those things. It's not like we knew all the answers at that point, but it allowed us at a much earlier stage to put in motion a bunch of stuff that we need to do that then got subsequently much more clarified and much more precise over time.

Lenny (00:35:30):
And so the leader of that team basically just went and studied the tax laws of each-

Jeremy Henrickson (00:35:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:35:36):
... country.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:35:36):
That's right, went all the way to ground. It's like, okay, let's go and open up the big old, I mean, it's online these days, the big old textbook and look like it's, or you're in the United States, it's like you have to go look at Ohio or Pennsylvania, which have all these little local city or county based taxes. And it's incredibly instructive to look at just a few of those and think, wow, how do I think about configuring these change unannounced? Some city administrator or the city legislature, whatever they call them, they decide to change the tax rate. Well, how are we going to know about that? How are we going to change it? How are we going to change it so it's effective at the right time?

(00:36:14):
And you don't think about those things until you've gone all the way to ground and looked at how these things are actually worked, how they're communicated, and how they're thought through. And I think the same thing is true of every aspect of every product in different ways. Right? It might be a technical thing, it might be a design thing, it might be a compliance or a regulatory or a governmental thing, but whatever it is, that detail always exists. And unless you're getting down there and seeing it and understanding it firsthand, you don't really understand what your product needs to do.

Lenny (00:36:42):
And I think an important element of this that's between the lines maybe is don't delegate this to someone. You may have a tax expert on the team, and I imagine many leaders would be like, go figure this out and tell me. And I think what you're saying is you go do that and learn, become the world expert at it.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:36:55):
That's right. That's right. You go do it. You go learn and then we can make the case for hiring the tax expert, which we do have by the way now. That's an incredibly important part of our success is having that specialist but not before somebody with a product mindset. The tax specialist is amazing at tax, right? That's what they're, they love and that's what they do, but that doesn't make them necessarily a great product thinker. So the person with the product thing has to get into those same weeds first to really understand it.

Lenny (00:37:24):
Do you give any guidance and just how much time to spend on all that stuff versus the regular day-to-day of, say, a product leader on a team, it takes a lot of time to become a world expert on the tax systems of many countries, or is it just there's nothing more important than that, that is your job, and what are you doing not doing that? How do you think about it?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:37:42):
I think it's equally if a job is 80 hours a week, it's 40 of your hours. I think that you can't really understand a product unless you've gone there. Right? And yes, it takes time and you're right, you can't just ignore the other half of the job of communicating with the engineering team and writing documents or whatever, but what's the point of writing a document if you don't know what you're talking about? And so we very deeply value that. And it's one of the reasons that we keep, at least at Rippling, our product organization really thin. We expect a single leader to be able to know the full scope of the product. In fact, great product leaders can in fact do that because they have this native curiosity and interest and ability to absorb a lot of stuff. And it makes, it's a lot of fun because now I have a group of people around me who are all really good at what they do and really understand what they do and that's kind of just an amazing place to be.

Lenny (00:38:42):
I'm looking at this list and I just want to keep asking questions about it. One of the sure principles that I love is it reminds me of Amazon has the same principle I believe, which is leaders are right a lot.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:38:52):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:38:53):
Why do you find that to be important? I know you weren't necessarily design all these principles, but I imagine that something that you guys follow often and comes up a lot.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:39:01):
I mean, this is one of my favorite ones because I think particularly for a product org, right? Because product leaders have to be right most of the time because their decisions reflect across the entire org and their decisions fundamentally spend time and they spend energy. And if they make good ones, the company does really well. And if they make bad ones, the company doesn't. And one of the things I really value in product leaders are people who can go into an ambiguous information with ambiguous situation, with incomplete information and a complex decision space and can look at that and listen to everybody and read whatever they need to read and say, this is where we need to go.

(00:39:43):
And even if everyone else is like, ah, I don't know, that feels wrong for this reason, this reason if they have the confidence to make that call, and then a year later when you look back on it, for them to have been right, that's extremely valuable. And it's one of these things that it's really hard to test for. You can get it by talking with people and asking, "Hey, was this person usually right in respect?" And people think about it, but in the context of a given company, just you have to take the time and see if those decisions are largely right. And it's the one value we have. It's like you can't really learn it. Either you're really, really good at making those kinds of decisions or you're not, right? It's a very peculiar skill that we really value.

Lenny (00:40:28):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit, I know you all are going through this global expansion. We talked about this a little bit.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:40:28):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:35):
And so just a few questions along this lines, because a lot of companies start one country, most companies do, and then they decide let's expand to new markets. So I guess first question is just how do you decide which markets to go after? And specifically where to start first and then just prioritizing the list of markets? What's kind of your algorithm for that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:40:55):
So it starts with an assumption that we're going to have to be everywhere ultimately, that you don't actually have to build native global payroll in every country in the world. Just makes sense to do that every country in the world. But you definitely want to be able to pay people in any country in the world and you want to be able to have contractors anywhere in the world and have their information be in your HRS anywhere in the world. And so the decision for us, we were fortunate to, or when we made that decision, to have quite a few customers already, like thousands of customers. And so we knew not only where their kind of US employees were, but by virtue of being an employee system work, we actually knew where they had other employees. And so it was quite easy for us to say, focusing on US-based companies, which is incomplete data.

(00:41:35):
But if we just look at our US-based companies, we know that there is immediate demand for those people to pay people in countries X, Y, and Z. And we just listed those out in raw numerical order. And then we kind of looked at, okay, how hard is it to build in these countries and how valuable is it to build in these countries? What is the strategic value of building in the UK or Canada or Germany or India or wherever? And then we had a discussion on where is there risk or where is this hard? Where is there a long pull? Where does this like, in what countries does it take a long time to get approval or whatever? And we just stack-ranked them and then we revisited that decision. The early decisions that we made on exactly which countries. We have subsequently reordered those over time. And as we've dove, dived in the countries, and learned more, we rejigger things like a little bit. But for the most part, that same basic list we started with is still mostly right.

Lenny (00:42:29):
Okay. And then the other question a lot of founders always struggle with is when is the time to start expanding internationally? Because there's pros and cons. Do you have a sense of what convinced y'all to start going international?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:42:41):
I think our case is slightly special, but I think the right answer to that question is always before you think you do before you think you need to because there are, it's harder than everyone if they've never done it before, it's harder than you think it is. It's more specialized than you think it is. People in the UK really, really care if there is a U in color, just as we care if there's not a U in color. There's just all of these subtle lessons that, like cultural lessons for companies that take a really, really long time to absorb. And so my view is you always should do it earlier than you think you should that, than you think you have to. In our case, it was always something we knew we had to do. In fact, we have a very clear thesis that companies that aren't global, particularly in payroll, but also in kind of insurance and benefits in IT. If you're not global, you're just not going to be around in 10 years because companies were becoming global, and then COVID happened and companies became global much faster.

(00:43:35):
It stopped being the province of 100-person companies plus and started filtering down into very, very small companies. It just became commonplace for small companies to be multi-country. And so that very much accelerated our timetable. And then you saw other people noticed that too, and you saw other companies starting to try to address parts of this problem as well. And so there's this kind of competitive dimension, which is sort of secondary in most ways because we were going to do it anyway, but that also kind of adds a little bit of a fire under the thing.

Lenny (00:44:06):
What have you found to be most surprising about expanding internationally to be successful in expansion? For folks that are maybe starting down this road of like, oh shoot, we should think about that.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:44:16):
I think the thing that was most surprising to me the first time I did this back at Guidewire in the [inaudible 00:44:23] and remains the most surprising thing to most people every time I do this again, is that every country is unique. You can't just take your US-based approach and drop it into another country. Other countries find it insulting. It doesn't matter how much success you've had here. Everyone always believes rightly or wrongly that their local context is special. And you have to respect that. And it comes down to little things like they're being a you in color or not. Or if you ever see a demo delivered to somebody in another country where they see a detailed screen about a person and it includes a social security number, it's like that you immediately lose credibility. Doesn't matter how good all the rest of your stuff is.

(00:45:08):
And I think that that is consistently the thing that I think is most surprising to people is the degree to which that's true, which seems obvious in retrospect. If you took a German system or something and demoed it in the United States with poorly translated stuff, we would think it would suck too. But it's not, it's really hard to adapt to that mindset. And so it takes just a lot of energy to overcome that organizationally.

Lenny (00:45:32):
Makes tons of sense. I'm going to go in a different direction now.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:45:36):
Sure.

Lenny (00:45:36):
Frameworks. So I know that you're not a huge fan of frameworks. We were chatting about this before we started recording. And so I'm curious just to hear your perspective on why you're maybe not a fan of frameworks and then also just how you crystallize processes and concepts for your team if you're not just like, Hey, here's our framework you should use.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:45:54):
Look, I think frameworks are very helpful. So I'm not exactly anti-framework, but I am anti-process as a substitution for deep product thinking, right? So I like to have just enough process to create a frame so that the right decisions can happen and know more. And I think there's a danger, especially as companies scale, that you end up saying, well, if only we categorize everything correctly and Jira, like we will be able to make really good prioritization decisions. So I'm like, sure, extremely helpful to have clear categorization and things that Jira doesn't have like data and analysis and to be able to do all of that stuff. But what you really need to do is decide important to build and then have a way to build it really efficiently. And so I think the right answer, the right amount of process for any given team is like, or the right framework for any team is really just dependent on their specific life cycle.

(00:46:47):
So you won't see me saying like, oh, we need to use this scrum thing or that combine thing, or whatever the latest, newest thing is. It's like, don't care about any of that. What I care is about something that's going to enable this team in this context at this point in their life cycle to build the right thing as efficiently as possible. And I'm fine if those are different for different teams. And the only place I care about unification is one on the quarterly planning process. And two, everything does need in fact to be in Jira because otherwise, you can't rationalize about what's actually getting done in not.

Lenny (00:47:18):
Is there a process or framework that you find is counterproductive that you're just stay away from this thing? We've had a lot of trouble with it, or generally, it's like let's just rethink everything ourselves.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:47:31):
No, I don't find one to be particular, I don't consistently found one to be particularly problematic. So I think any framework sort of has its place, the right place, right time. I think there's danger any one time somebody like dogmatically says, I think we should use process X because that's almost never the right answer in my experience. I think there are places where that can differ. Like you start a company on the basis of process X and everyone's bought into that process and everyone understands it. I think they can be really, really great. And on the engineering side, I think this is hugely valuable. It's like test driven-development, first line of code's going to be a test, not the actual thing. Like fantastic, very supportive of all that. I think it's kind of different in the product world.

Lenny (00:48:08):
If you had to compare the way Coinbase builds product process-wise or just product development to Rippling, what would you say are the bigger differences?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:48:17):
I think the differences are largely born of the different domains. So crypto, as we talked about earlier, really hard to predict what's going on. There's all these questions about what's the future of crypto, what's going to matter, what do we even need to build? What's going to survive? And so the process we had at Coinbase run, having those debates and getting to a decision and disagreeing, committing. And then from an execution point of view, being able to move fast. That was the trick at Coinbase. Here we know the things that we need to build at a high level. And the trick is how do we really differentiate it on the basis of these amazing platform capabilities we have? Or how do we have to evolve those platform capabilities in order to continue to build something that's just discontinuously better than everything that's out there? And that yields a different decision-making process. So for me, it's the mental model is actually of how I approach those things with the same, but they just yield different results in the actual making of the software.

Lenny (00:49:12):
What is that actual difference? Do you find day-to-day? Is it timeline differences? Is it how quickly, I don't know the way you structure, how far out you plan, what do you find is the concrete difference as a result?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:49:25):
I think the difference is in the day-to-day velocity of decision-making, because we can, Rippling, if you're on, I don't know, pick a random team. If you're on the device management team, you know what you got to do, right? There's no ambiguity. You're not debating about whether Mac or Windows is going to exist in the future. There's none of that cognitive dissonance. There is, we need to build this. It's hard to figure out how we need to build this, right? Because there's all these different things that we could leverage, but we need to basically get this done.

(00:49:58):
And so the kind of total velocity I would say is higher here, which does not say people work harder or less are at Columbia. Columbia was an amazingly fast environment, but it was also subject to the fact that you just don't know what the crypto markets are going to do, and you have to be incredibly reactive to that. And so I think maybe that's the one thing, like the reactivity to the environment and the crypto environment, what's going on, and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment, all that stuff. We got really, really, really good at handling those things really rapidly, which is something that we need to handle somewhat less [inaudible 00:50:34].

Lenny (00:50:33):
Sounds quite stressful at Coinbase.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:50:38):
Yeah, I mean it was fun. Yes, it was stressful. I mean, every job I've ever had has been stressful, but in its own unique way. But all of that stress I think is in the shape of a problem, that's in the context of a problem that's really interesting. I mean that's why I stayed at these places. But yeah, it's stressful.

Lenny (00:51:00):
And looking back, what a joy.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:02):
Yeah. No, there are very good memories. I look back, I don't really, I remember the stress, but I don't like re-experience it, right. I remember foraging these relationships and building these amazing products that I've been so lucky to be a part of. And so I have almost only good memories of the places I've been.

Lenny (00:51:21):
That's what I find too. You go through these hardships and then you look back and you're like, wow, that was so cool. But assuming they go well, assuming the company works out and-

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:21):
True.

Lenny (00:51:29):
... it feels like it was successful. A lot of times you're at a startup, your life sucks for two years and it doesn't work out and that there is a lot of upside and good memories to that, but it's less glorious.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:41):
Yeah, that's fair though. I mean, the first company I was really at out of school's company called Reactivity back in internet one era, and we were trying to figure out how does this internet thing work and how do we start companies on the basis of these tech new technologies and how do we help other companies build stuff and figure it out? And that company fundamentally didn't work out, ultimately got kind of spun itself out and got acquired, which was great, but it was this extraordinary set of people that I was so lucky to work with and I loved all the time I spent there and it was foundational to everything else I ever did. And so even though that effort didn't pay off in the traditional set, the value of the learnings I had there and then the people I had a chance to work with was just really exceptional. So I feel very lucky.

Lenny (00:52:30):
That's a really good point actually. And I think I should correct even what I said that even when things don't work out, traditionally those experiences end up being incredibly valuable in all these unexpected ways.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:42):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny (00:52:44):
Yeah. Okay, so final topic.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:45):
Sure.

Lenny (00:52:45):
I want to talk about hiring product managers and interviewing.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:52:49):
So you've hired a lot of PMs over the years. I'm curious, what's something you've learned about what to look for in product managers and also just in product leaders that other people may not be focused on as enough?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:53:00):
I mean, I don't know that I have any particularly special insight here. I think there's a couple things that I do ask that maybe are more of an emphasis because it's Rippling than not. But the first of those is when people are going through our process, there's a part where they do this case study and an important part of the case study is that it's actually too complex for people to have all of the answers upfront. There's just the space of the problem is too large to do that, which means that in the interview there's a lot of opportunities or in the case study there's a lot of opportunities. So just ask ad hoc questions or to change one assumption. And seeing how people react to that is really indicative of how deeply they understand a new problem or how quickly or how mentally agile they are.

(00:53:47):
And some people are extremely good at that here in assumption and they blink a couple times. They're like, oh, well that has these 400 implications. And they just start rattling them off. And some people get really flummoxed. I mean obviously for our environment, that former is really, really important to us. I think the other thing that really matters to me is the insightfulness of questions that people ask, which is indicative of number one, their actual interest in the job.

(00:54:14):
People tend to ask better questions when they're more excited about working at a place and done their research and are asking people about it. And also the quality of those questions can vary quite dramatically. And that's okay. I don't expect the quality to be the same all the time, but sometimes people ask a question, I'm like, "Oh man, I would've never thought to ask that question. That's such an insightful question." And then I pause and I have to think about my answer a little bit. And so it kind of pushes me to be a little bit better. And when that happens, I know I usually have pretty good candidate on my hands.

Lenny (00:54:42):
Is there an example of someone asking a really good question that comes to mind that you think back to and like, Oh wow, that was great.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:54:49):
I remember about three years ago I was interviewing a guy named Kyle Boston and Kyle is now runs our platform product organization. And I can't remember the specific question he asked, but it had something to do with, wait a minute, if you have all these products and you have this employee system of record thing underneath it, we be thinking about how to create these various pillars of underlying platform technology, things like [inaudible 00:55:22] all this stuff. And this was before we fully formalized the concept of our platform beyond the kind of employee system of record.

(00:55:29):
And I remember thinking, yes, we should, and that had entered our minds before, but the fact that somebody which who had almost no context on the company, that's what was impressive about this question. It's like, man, you've been thinking about Rippling for a couple weeks while you're interviewing with a bunch of other companies or whatever. And you've thought about it deeply enough to have this insight into the nature of the platform that we're building immediately gave me a bunch of confidence in his ability to think through the sorts of things we need him to think through.

Lenny (00:55:58):
And I think it touches on PMs need to be business leaders and great questions are often about the business and the future of the business and how to make it run more efficiently and this, and there's a product org element to it. But I find that that's a really underappreciated element of PM interviews, just thinking about the bigger business, not just the PM product.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:56:19):
For me it's two things. It's thinking about the bigger business and having the context around whether it's revenue questions or strategy questions, but also the detailed questions. It's like, oh wait a minute. The implication of this thing that I'm getting asked or of this thing with Jeremy that you said earlier is all of these things. And their ability to understand that this isn't a simple business, it's really hard, it's really complex. And the ability to have these insights to help them think through those details is really cool.

Lenny (00:56:49):
You talked about this prompt you give product managers not to give away what you actually asked these days, but is there an example of a prompt that you've given in the past or you think is a good example of a type of prompt to give a product manager candidate.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:57:01):
In terms of a general kind of approach, I think a prompt should always reflect the actual business that they're going to kind of come into. So when we do, so our process overall is actually quite short. It's basically get in contact with us somehow, eventually get connected with a hiring manager, have a conversation with them. Then more or less you have a conversation with me, which is a product discussion. And then we have a case study which follows that. That's the whole process. Modulo, other conversations around the edges. And the questions that matter are around how do people think through that product discussion, which is relevant to our business. How do people think through that case study? That's number one. And the second thing is there's always a part of my interview, which is maybe sounds very simple, but it's just like, Hey, what questions do you have for me?

(00:57:53):
We actually do that before we do the product discussion. And that's an incredibly important question because it is again indicative of these things that people have thought through or not thought through or the depth that they're thinking or their interest in engagement in the role. And at that second discussion, it doesn't have to be perfect or anything, but it is a very strong signal when people, whether they've thought through a set of questions they want to ask or just on the fly generating them, you learn a lot about how people think about product, about what they're looking for, about what they like doing and not doing, just through those questions.

Lenny (00:58:30):
For PMs that are maybe in their early career that are listening to this, what advice would you give them to help them accelerate and advance their career most in the early part of their career?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:58:41):
Be humble. Being a product person means that by definition you're living in a world where no one knows the right answer yet because if somebody did, they would've already built it. And so having, no matter how smart you are, there's a lot of smart people out there. There's always stuff you don't know. There's always people who are going to know things that you don't know. And it is only through that acknowledgement that you can actually have the humility to say, I'm open to absorbing all of this stuff, I don't know. And open to synthesizing all this stuff and coming to different conclusions.

(00:59:12):
And so I found that that humility is one of the biggest differentiators in early career leaders who are able to let go of how awesome they were in school or in their first job or whatever. I mean, I had to do this and realize the job is always hard and the job is always about discovery every single day. And if you can maintain that curiosity and elasticity of thought and creativity and light coming solutions could be awesome. But if you close yourself off to that and think you always have the right answer, then there's like no hope.

Lenny (00:59:49):
This touches on another principle that I still have sitting on my screen here, which is great leaders change their minds a lot or just change their minds.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:59:57):
Yeah. Willing to look at new information and say, my mental model is adjusted by that or I was wrong very simply. I mean I think it's also important to be operating in an environment where you're allowed to say that you're wrong, right? Everyone's wrong sometimes. I mean be right a lot, but everyone's wrong sometimes. Right? And being in be able to be an environment where you can just say, yep, I was wrong. Here's the way in which I was wrong. Let's move on, is incredibly powerful.

Lenny (01:00:19):
The final question you've brought up Parker a number of times and something that is clear about him is that he's a very product-minded founder. He has a lot of strong opinions about what product should be. And as a product leader with a founder like that is often a challenging place to be similar to being the first PM at a startup and the founder has strong opinions about product. So my question is just what have you learned about being successful as a product leader with a founder that has very strong opinions about what the product should be?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:00:47):
Yeah, no, that's a great question. So I think you've got to be adaptable, right? It's like any other relationship, right? You have to understand what the nature of that relationship is, where that person's going to care, where you're going to care, the ways in which you can challenge each other. I think fundamentally you need to make sure that person is willing to be challenged, right? So I've seen product leaders or CEOs who are kind of unwilling to be challenged and I wouldn't be able to work with those people.

(01:01:17):
But yeah, Parker is incredibly strongly opinionated, but he's also incredibly informed, which makes for some really, really great debates. And I've just found that whatever, and it's not even CEO, but whatever a manager's idiosyncrasies are, you have to find a way to work with those. And I think that adaptability, like I'm just sort of, I like being a moldable puzzle piece where I can just fit in. I think that's actually one of my core skills. And so that's worked out for me and Parker and I before I started developing a deep foundation of respect, which is extremely important to building that. And over the years it's just gotten deeper and deeper and we don't always agree, but when we can have a totally reasonable discussion about it, and that's what makes it fun.

Lenny (01:02:06):
Adaptability actually is, I took a strength finder test once of finding my own strengths and that was my number one strength is I'm [inaudible 01:02:14] I think we share that.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:15):
That's excellent.

Lenny (01:02:15):
Yeah, seems like an important attribute for being in a place in. Well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you if you're ready.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:25):
All right, I'm ready. Hit me.

Lenny (01:02:27):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:31):
Well, first is my favorite series of books ever, which is the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson. It's a nine-volume epic or three-volume, nine-book epic depending on how you want to look at it. But it's about the time just before and into the enlightenment, historical fiction, a lot of fun. And I also love the Culture series by Iain Banks, which is just super fun, far-future sort of universe that I've really enjoyed.

Lenny (01:02:59):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:01):
Watched The Last of Us, was an avid fan of the game and I thought they did a really nice adaptation. Favorite mov, like I guess, recent movie, it's not that recent, but I really like Tenet, which I thought was a, I was impressed with their ability to go there and make that movie and I just really enjoyed it end to end.

Lenny (01:03:23):
It kind of ended, but we had a drinking game anytime someone mentioned Last of Us, which took over White Lotus. I'm going to drink some tea right here.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:30):
Okay, fair enough. I'll try. I've only got water normally I got tea, but water today.

Lenny (01:03:33):
That works. But it's interesting, it hasn't come up often, so I think maybe we end that for now and see what the new pattern emerges. And then Tenant feels like, I was just thinking it feels like a compound movie, compound startup as a movie, a movie is very complicated too to stay-

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:50):
Yeah, That's why I enjoyed it. I like trying to figure out the multi-timeline chart in my head as the movie progressed.

Lenny (01:03:56):
The puzzle piece within you trying to find all the puzzle pieces.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:59):
Yeah, for sure.

Lenny (01:04:00):
What is a favorite interview question you like to ask? You already maybe answered this, but anything else come to mind?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:06):
I think I did, no, my favorite one is What questions do you have for me by far?

Lenny (01:04:09):
Great. What are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you love?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:14):
I guess I'll just mention, I don't know if I go as far as I call these favorite products, but there's two that come to mind. My wife's computer broke the other day and I realized it was the CPU cooler that went bad and the Corsair H60 CPU cooler was super easy to use and really adaptable to lots of motherboards. I thought that was great. My other favorite product is the one I'm wearing in my ears right now, which my first pair of nice headphones I ever bought died late last week, and had to do some really quick research into my new favorite pair of headphones. And these Focal Bathys are super nice. I'm a bit of an audio file. I like to listen to classical music and ambient stuff, so we need a lot of dynamic range and noise cancellation and these have been great so far.

Lenny (01:04:57):
Okay, so what are they called?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:59):
Focal, I think it's Bathys, B-A-T-H-Y-S. Okay.

Lenny (01:05:04):
And has there a specific model or there's like that one?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:06):
That's it.

Lenny (01:05:06):
Okay.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:07):
You'll know it when you see it.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Okay. We will link to them in show notes, so maybe I'll get one. What's something relatively minor you've changed in the way that you built product that has had a lot of impact on your team's ability to execute?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:20):
Maybe the most recent innovation sort of at Rippling was the kind of introduction of what I'm calling imperatives. These things that whether they come bottom up or top down are things that like everybody across the entire product and engineering team needs to do and what's important about that list of things that are not on it. And in a world where we could choose to do hundreds of things at once, being able to force rank that list of things, draw a line, say these are the ones everyone has to do, has created a lot more focus and clarity than we had before.

Lenny (01:05:48):
So imperatives are essentially here's the priorities for the next, say quarter six months here?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:53):
Here are the priorities for everybody and now integrate that into your own team's priorities, right? So each team still is building their own priorities, but they have to factor in this set.

Lenny (01:06:05):
How many of those do you usually have? This is awesome. I like this tip.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:09):
It depends on what level of granularity you want to talk about them at, like maybe 10, right? It's a lot. We're going through between globalization and large improvements of the platform and a bunch of other large companies. All these things, it creates a bunch of things that just have to be cross-team simultaneously. I think it's pretty natural part of a company's evolution and we're just in that part of the cycle, so-

Lenny (01:06:33):
Awesome.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:33):
... used it.

Lenny (01:06:34):
Final question, what's a question I should have asked you that I didn't ask you?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:38):
I guess, what do I do with my kids maybe? I have two kids, they're nine and-

Lenny (01:06:38):
What do you do with your kids?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:43):
... six. What do I do with my kids? My son, I'm a big board gamer and while I didn't push it on him, my son, he will play board games morning to night. And so we play a lot of European strategy games together and my daughter's now getting old enough that she's getting into them too. And so we just finished as a family playing Pandemic Legacy and the reward tomorrow night as we get to start playing Gloomhaven. So that's going to be fun.

Lenny (01:07:12):
I don't know either game, sounds very hard and complicated.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:15):
They're fun. They're fun.

Lenny (01:07:17):
Amazing. Jeremy, we covered a lot of topics. I feel like this is a compound podcast episode and so thank you for spending time with me. Thanks for being here. Two final questions, working folks, finding online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:32):
Awesome. LinkedIn is the easiest way online and if what I've been talking about today sounds interesting to you, we're definitely hiring like senior entrepreneurial PMs. And so if those leadership principles on our website look interesting, I'd love to hear from you.

Lenny (01:07:46):
What's the best way to explore those roles and apply? The

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:49):
The website has by far the best channel. It gets to this right recruiter who will tell me about it right away.

Lenny (01:07:55):
Great, surfline.com and there's probably a site for careers.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:58):
There is a career site on there that you, pretty easy to find.

Lenny (01:08:00):
Okay. Rolling to that in the show notes. Jeremy, thank you again for being here.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:08:04):
Thanks so much for having me. This was a lot of fun.

# How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don’t want? | Jerry Colonna

## Transcript

Jerry Colonna (00:00:00):
We're socialized to bullshit not only ourselves, but everybody else, especially in the entrepreneurial community. All our companies are moving up into the right. Every product is working. We don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency. A perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Today, my guest is Jerry Colonna. Jerry is one of the most well-known and respected executive coaches in the world. He's co-founder and CEO of Reboot, an executive and leadership development firm grounded in the belief that better humans make better leaders. Prior to coaching, Jerry co-founded Flatiron Partners with Fred Wilson, which ended up being one of the most successful early-stage investment funds in the world. He's also a partner at JPMorgan Chase and the author of two books, Reboot and Reunion. As you might expect, this ended up being a very real and very open conversation about being busy and self-inquiry and the dangers of a growth mindset and the reasons that leaders and teams most often fail, and it's not what you think. Also, we talk about a very simple equation that Jerry and his team use to cultivate great leaders.

(00:01:37):

Jerry Colonna (00:04:19):
Well, thanks for having me, Lenny. It's really a delight to meet you and to be with you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:24):
I want to start with a very classic Jerry Colonna piece of advice that I've heard you share in other places, and I just want more people to hear this advice, and this is a question that you ask people when things aren't going their way, and I'll give you a hint. The question contains the word complicit.

Jerry Colonna (00:04:40):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
Can you share this question and why it's so important to ask this of yourself?

Jerry Colonna (00:04:45):
The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? And if it's helpful, let me break down the question a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
Please.

Jerry Colonna (00:04:58):
So I purposely chose the word complicit because complicit does not mean responsible, and that's a really important distinction. And as I often say, to understand the word complicit, think of the word accomplice. As I will share, you are driving the getaway car, you're not sticking up the bank teller. The second half of that question is I say I don't want. And sometimes people hear that question and they interpret it as, how have I been responsible for the shit in my life? And that is not the purpose of this question. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency, is to look at the ways in which you may have been diluting yourself.

(00:05:56):
A perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. And the reason that this is all really important is part of my approach not only to coaching, but to the process of growing up, is to use what I call radical self-inquiry, to really cut through our own delusions and say, how does it serve me to feel completely busy to the point where I feel exhausted? And perhaps there's another more conscious way of getting that feeling than feeling like crap all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:56):
This is a good segue to something that I hear you. You have this equation that you and your firm use to think about how to create and cultivate great leaders, and it includes one of the variables is radical self-inquiry. Can you share this equation and just how you work with folks to build this in them?

Jerry Colonna (00:07:14):
Sure. I'll tell a little story about that. I remember one time I was, this is how the equation came to be. I was doing a talk, I think here in Boulder at Naropa University where I used to be on the board of trustees. It's a Buddhist university, and as is often the case, I'm winging it as I go and I'm walking around probably without shoes on because that's what I do. And there was a dry erase board behind me and I was trying to explain what it was that I do, what it was that I encourage people to do. And I jumped up at the board and I wrote practical skills. And in writing that, what I was trying to convey, what it is that people typically come to a coach for. They want to understand how to do their job. They want to understand how to live. They want to understand the how.

(00:08:11):
And then, I wrote plus, and then I sketched out radical self-inquiry. And I said in that moment, I said, "People will come and ask me how, and I will drive them crazy because I will say something like, tell me about your father, or tell me why you chose to be in the job you're in the first place, or tell me about your relationship to money, or tell me about your relationship to self-worth." And then, I expanded it and I put another plus sign and I said, "Shared experiences." And then, I drew an equals equation line underneath the whole thing, and I said, "Enhanced leadership plus greater resiliency."

(00:09:05):
And so, the equation is practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences, that is the process of actually talking about the craziness that goes on in your head equals greater leadership. That all makes sense. But then, there was this other piece, enhanced resilience. And when I do this on a dry erase board, I will often circle that phrase, and I say that is the purpose of this whole thing, because the truth is, if you follow my story at all, you know that in my late 30s, the depression that had really marked most of my life had gotten so bad that despite my outward success, I was suicidal and lost.

(00:09:58):
And I will turn to the audience and I say, "I get you want to be a great CEO, I get you want to be a great executive, but what I really care about is you not killing yourself in the process." So if we take a step back, the whole point of what we refer to as the equation really boils down to that point, how do we grow up and become the leaders, the adults we were born to be without feeling like crap?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):
And there's this huge implication here that a lot of people think that when they reach a certain point, become successful, make a certain amount of money, get a beautiful house, still be happy. And essentially what you're saying here is that's very often not the case. Maybe in most cases, not the case.

Jerry Colonna (00:10:48):
It's not only not the case, it's the big lie that we're socialized with since childhood. I remember one time I was on the road doing a talk for, I was promoting my first book, Reboot, and I was at, I think it's called the Fitler Club in Philadelphia. I was doing a fireside chat. And after talking with my conversation partner, a guy named Chris Fralic who was one of the co-founders at First Round, really, really good guy. We turned to the audience and there was a Q&A as there often is, and this young guy shoots his hand up and he introduces himself and he says, "I'm 19." And he looks over to his right and his mother's sitting there and he says, "And my mother brought me here," which I laughed.

(00:11:40):
And he said, "So what you're telling me is you don't have to be an asshole to be successful." And I could not think of a better summation of everything that I'm about than for a 19-year-old kid to look up and say, "You don't have to be an asshole to be successful." And of course, the corollary to that is you don't have to feel miserable just because you're trying to create a career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):
As people start to think about this and think, okay, I feel like I've been heading in this direction of I just need to keep climbing the ladder, making more money, as they hear you talk, what's the pivot that folks should make in their mind around where they should actually be heading? What is a direction where they'll end up not wanting to kill themselves, in spite of being successful?

Jerry Colonna (00:12:34):
To be clear, not everyone ends up in that level of depression, but the hack, if you will, is consciousness. So what do I mean by that? Part of what makes radical self-inquiry radical is we're socialized not to ask certain kinds of questions. So for example, someone says, "It's really important for me to be ambitious and achieve a particular goal." What's radical, a radical question to ask is, and what will that do for you? What is it that you believe being "successful" will do for you? How do you define success? Where does that come from?

(00:13:30):
In Reboot, my first book, I tell the story of what I refer to as my pursuit of lemon drops. And briefly, when I was a boy, there was a lot... I grew up with an enormous amount of chaos and insecurity, financial and otherwise. And a big source of stability in my life were my mother's parents, my grandfather and grandmother. And Grandpa Guido, who was an ice man and emigrated from southern Italy in early 20th century, always seemed to have, well, he had this endless supply of lemon drops, and they were always kept in this green pantry outside of the kitchen. And for me, the stability and what I considered wealth seemed to match to this notion of this endless supply of lemon drops. And when I got to my 30s and I was outwardly successful and I was a hot shot BC, I had lemon drops, but I didn't feel safe, which was a mindful.

(00:15:02):
And so, I told that story in Reboot as part of my exploration into the core question of how did my relationship to money shape my career choices, shape my school choices, shape my own sense of safety and self-worth? So long-winded response to your question, what I encourage people to do is to ask themselves these kinds of questions so that they can raise their level of consciousness so that they can be in the driver's seat of their lives and not some learned behavior that they developed as a child to answer perhaps their parents or grandparents' anxieties.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
I feel like a lot of people hearing this are afraid to ask these sorts of questions. The reason they don't ask these questions is because they worry that this is going to be like, okay, I got to quit my job, move to the woods, give up all these luxuries they have. I don't even want to think about that. I got a whole family to support. I got to succeed. Advice for getting over that hump of just like-

Jerry Colonna (00:16:17):
So let's just pause, Lenny. Okay, so what you're doing in this moment is empathetically imagining what may be going on for your listener, but the empathy is actually based on your own question because you invited me on the show, you knew I was going to get to this point. So I'm imagining that as you take this in, that thought stream shows up for you. "Jerry," says Lenny, "If I open up that closet, all the shit's going to fall out, and what am I going to do with it?" Does that resonate at all?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:58):
This is why I was nervous to have you on this podcast. I knew what you-

Jerry Colonna (00:17:05):
So answer my question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:07):
I don't think it's that strong for me to be afraid of that because I've taken a different path already and gotten off the career ladder climbing treadmill. On the other hand, back to your original question, we talked about being busy. I'm very guilty of that. I'm constantly trying to do less, but constantly doing more, and my life is just very busy.

Jerry Colonna (00:17:28):
Thank you for giving me more of that answer. And trust me, your listeners are going to appreciate you being fully there in just the way you were. So let's take a step back. The fear is, if I can reflect back to your original question, the fear is if I go there, I don't know what's going to happen as a consequence of that. If I pause and ask myself, is this relationship working out for me? I might end up leaving this relationship. If I pause and ask myself if this career isn't working for me, I might leave my career.

(00:18:25):
And the good news bad news is that's true. That is absolutely true. And if we look at some of the other observations we were making before like anxiety and depression, we have this belief system that if I pay no attention to the thing that I'm afraid of, it's somehow going to magically go away. If we pay no attention to the source of discomfort, it's somehow going to go away. And that's not actually how life works. More often than not, what we do is we respond to the source of challenge, whether it's a discomfort in our relationship, whether it's a discomfort in the way my life has unfolded. We respond to it by plasting over band-aids and sometimes they're relatively healthy, we become obsessed with working out, or sometimes they're unhealthy. We become obsessed with work or substance abuse or that kind of thing. Or sometimes, and this is super popular right now, we lean into what I would call as a spiritual bypassing where we go to Peru and we go do ayahuasca or we spend the weekend doing mushrooms with friends...

(00:20:08):
And what we're really not doing, Lenny, is confronting the parts of ourselves that need some tending to because we're afraid of the consequences. But I'll tell you a quick quote. One of my favorite books is Bruce Springsteen's autobiography, and about in the middle of the book, he has this passage where he talks about having spent 25 years in psychoanalysis. So let me just let that statement land. Bruce fucking Springsteen, 25 years in psychoanalysis. And he has this passage where he talks about the unsorted baggage of our childhood. And what he rightly asserts is that we all have unsorted baggage, and at some point we're going to pay the price of not sorting that baggage. And the price more often than not is in tears.

(00:21:21):
Now, this is Bruce Springsteen talking about this. This is not some airy-fairy transpersonal Jerry Colonna coach. And the reason I draw that out is we as children are socialized not to develop these consciousness skills. We are socialized to develop what I would call bypassing skills. And as he correctly points out, if you continue to bypass sorting out your baggage, there's going to come a day where you're going to have to pay that price. It could be in your own depression, it could be in, I've seen this a thousand times Lenny, entrepreneurs sabotaging their successful businesses because the belief system from their childhood goes something like, I don't deserve success so let me blow it up. We put this all under the rubric of midlife, but I don't know, when does midlife begin, 35? When does it end, 70? What I do know is it's the bulk of our adulthood.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
Okay, I think you've done an excellent job convincing me and others to spend time on this now, and I think there's an assumption of it gets harder, the tears get more intense as you wait longer. There's this ticking time bomb that better some amount of tears now than 10 times more tears later. Is that right?

Jerry Colonna (00:23:04):
Well said.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
Okay. So coming back to this equation, I think I want to give people some things to do now that they may be likely convinced, okay, I should really rethink what I'm doing. So back to the equation, practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences equals enhanced leadership and greater resilience. So the three things you can work on are practical skills, radical self-inquiry, shared experiences, skills I think people get. So radical self-inquiry, these are essentially questions to dig into what drives you, what makes you happy. What are some questions again that people should be asking there as they're listening or maybe after they finish listening?

Jerry Colonna (00:23:40):
In the time since I've been a coach, which is now going on 27 years, the popularity of journaling has gone up, which is awesome. And part of what happens is people journal, but they don't know what they should be journaling or how they should. So let me give some questions then, and this is a way to approach it. Let's imagine that what we're trying to do, whether we're sitting in meditation, whether we're journaling, whether we're taking time away, we're just pausing and starting to ask ourselves questions. So my famous questions include things like, what am I not saying that I need to say? So let's imagine ourselves in a relationship that's not working.

(00:24:30):
Talk about something that could be terrifying. What am I not saying in that relationship that I need to say? By the way, this is a good question to ask if one is responsible for leading people too. Corollary questions to that would be, what am I saying that's not being heard? And then, of course, what's being said that I'm not hearing? So if we just pause and look at those four questions, how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? And what's being said that I'm not hearing? Can you feel the power of all of that in those questions?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:25):
Yeah. Scary questions.

Jerry Colonna (00:25:27):
They are scary questions. You know you're in the radical self-inquiry zone when the questions take your breath away, when the questions, and by the way, you don't have to share the answers to these questions with anybody but yourself. Now, there could be some power in sharing them in a group of friends and sharing them with a group of colleagues, sharing them with a coach, sharing them with a therapist. But the most important person with whom you should share the answers is oneself. This is a little bit of Buddhism here. Self-delusion along with attachment are the biggest contributors to our own suffering. Self-delusion. Everything's great. How you doing? Everything's great. Bullshit. Can we just not bullshit each other?

(00:26:30):
So let me just pause. Those are just four questions. My first book Reboot has a set of questions after every single chapter. We also have a journal that we put out that has questions and questions, but the more important thing to take away from this is questions that startle us, questions that may cause us to be a little afraid of the answer, that's where the gold is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:02):
And we'll point people to the book for many more of these questions and the worksheets. For the third party equation, shared experiences, can you explain what that is?

Jerry Colonna (00:27:11):
We were talking about socialization, for example. Prior to launching Reboot, the company, my co-founder, Ali Schultz and I, the roots of Reboot the company began with me designing, or Ali and I designing these boot camps. And the original iteration of the boot camp, we used to call CEO Boot Camp because it was originally we would get first-time CEOs together and we would do a bait and switch. We would pretend to sell them practical skills, and then I would start asking really tough questions like who would you be without the story of who you are? It's like what?

(00:27:57):
The notion of shared experience as an important component grew out of that. Because what would happen is imagine sitting in a circle of people who just have your back, who really care about you as a person. And imagine then discussing some of the answers to those questions. Who would you be without the story of who you are? What is it that you wish that people in your life knew about you, but you're too afraid to tell them? And imagine sitting in a group of people who can just hold that space without fixing you, without telling you what you're doing right or wrong? We, too often than not, especially in what I would say the entrepreneurial community are socialized to bullshit not only ourselves, but everybody else. All our companies are moving up into the right, every product that's working, we don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. Imagine having the capacity to be in relationship with people where you can just tell the truth. That's what shared experiences are about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):
My wife does a women's circle where they gather and just share what's really going on within in their lives. And it's-

Jerry Colonna (00:29:26):
That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):
And it's very confidential. There's a ritual to it, and it feels like that's a really good avenue for things like that.

Jerry Colonna (00:29:42):
What circle do you sit in?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
No circles. This is my circle.

Jerry Colonna (00:29:49):
But there is something powerful here. I think in the last 15 years, the rise of podcasts, good podcasts. What I think what happens is let's hope this is happening for your audience right now, good quality intimate conversation between people who are authentic and real, creates space for someone to be authentic and real, even if it's just with themselves. So you're doing a mitzvah, you're doing a good deed by creating this space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:24):
Thanks, Jerry. Let's go back to the busyness point, and I'll talk about myself a bit to get it real again, because I think it's also something a lot of people struggle with. I listen to this, they're just like, I'm so busy, and every time someone ask me how I'm doing, busy, so busy, like swirly eyes emoji, swirly eyes emoji.

Jerry Colonna (00:30:45):
With a little head shake.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:47):
That's right. And the melting face emoji. And that's very much me. And it's funny because I started this journey of the newsletter of just like I call the project avoid getting a real job. And it was just like, cool, just do this newsletter thing, not have the job. It'll be chill, write an email once a week. But I just find myself taking on endlessly more and more. And for me, I feel like the drive is it's just fun to see it grow and for it to keep building and doing well.

(00:31:17):
This reminds me, there's a quote that Will Smith shared once that I think you'll like. Someone asked him what it's like to be famous, and he's like, "Really awesome as you're going up to fame. Pretty okay as a famous person. Really bad when you lose that fame." And that's how it feels with the growth of this thing. It's just like growth is up. Oh, life's good, and then it starts to stall. I'm like, oh, no, it's all going to fall apart. So I think that's where a lot of that comes from for me. It's just like, oh, what's next? I got to, let's see what else I can do here.

Jerry Colonna (00:31:44):
Well, how do you feel about yourself when you're on that growth trajectory?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):
I feel great.

Jerry Colonna (00:31:52):
Say more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
I feel like I'm achieving and heading in a... Part of it is just fun. It's like fun to win. So it's just like, yeah, we're doing it. It's working.

Jerry Colonna (00:32:07):
And when you're not growing, how do you feel about yourself?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:13):
About myself. There's this sense that it's all over. Oh, maybe it's all going to fall apart, and maybe I'm not as good at this as I thought, and maybe-

Jerry Colonna (00:32:25):
Okay, so stay in that spot for a moment. So imagine, and I don't know that this is true, but I can imagine that there's a little whispery voice in your head that's always there that says, "Lenny, you're not as good as you think you are. In fact, Lenny, they might even find out."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
Yep. Yeah, imposter syndrome.

Jerry Colonna (00:32:52):
Oh, shit. So by being busy and by being on that growth trajectory, that voice maybe sounds a little less persistent, maybe a little less loud. Now, I want to offer a different potential. What if you could enjoy the puzzle of trying to create something new, trying to create magic, something out of nothing, but it doesn't matter to your sense of self-esteem if you succeed or fail. What if what drove you was not quieting that voice, but what drove you was, oh, this is just fun? Seth Godin, who's a dear, dear friend of mine, talks about art projects.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
Also a former podcast guest.

Jerry Colonna (00:33:57):
So what if you just approached the project as if it was an art project? I think it's going to show up this way. What if it turns out it's wrong? What if it's this? What if it's that? And your sense of self-esteem is not attached to the outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):
What's interesting is that's how I started this whole thing. I had no intention of it being a career and way I make a living. It was just, this is cool, people seem to like it, I enjoy it. Let's just see where it goes. No expectations.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:28):
And then what happened?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
And then it worked.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:30):
It became successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):
That's right. It worked out.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:33):
Right. It became successful, meaning you developed an audience, meaning you developed a following.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:41):
And then, income. That was a big part of it.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:43):
And then you developed an income, and then the stakes went up, and then all of a sudden, my heart, the anxiety.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:54):
Not quite that strongly. At times it is, but there's a bit of just, oh, wow, I am relying on this now. I can't just let it fall apart.

Jerry Colonna (00:35:03):
Because my life would fall apart if I let it fall apart.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:07):
Yeah, life would change in a big way if this whole thing ends.

Jerry Colonna (00:35:11):
Right. Right. So what you're talking about, what we're talking about right now, remember before I said in Buddhism, we talk about self-delusion and attachment. Now, we're talking about attachment. When we become attached to the outcome, we inadvertently fuel our own suffering. When we become attached, and in this case, okay, I get it. There's a financial reality. This is important because it helps pay the bills, if it doesn't entirely pay the bills. Great. Got it. Fabulous. But really the deeper attachment is see, I'm not nothing. See, I'm not a nobody, I'm a somebody, and that's the source of the suffering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
That is so true. That is very much a part of what has driven me is I was always a very shy kid growing up, and I don't think people expected a lot of me except my mom and dad, I guess. And so, I always had the sense, I'll show them, I'll show them what I could do, and that's always, it's this chip on the shoulder thing that I know drives a lot of people.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:29):
How old are you, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):
43.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:30):
Okay. So maybe now at 43, you can take in the fact that you are somebody regardless of what you do. What's your wife's name?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:48):
Michelle.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:49):
Is she going to love you even if the podcast fails?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
Absolutely.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:55):
What, is she an idiot? No, she's a smart person. The people who actually know you and care about you may be proud of your efforts, but their love for you is not dependent upon its success. And that's like a rewiring. Do you have children?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
Yeah, we got a 22-month-old now.

Jerry Colonna (00:37:30):
Oh, mazel tov. That's wonderful. My children are 34, 32, and 28. So I'll speak like the old man that I am. When we take that test, that spelling test, and we stick it with magnets on the refrigerator, it's at a pride. The challenging message that we inadvertently can send to our children is that we only love them because they got an A on the spelling test. And so, it's really critically important that we as parents do our own internal work to convey that unconditional love that is our birthright as human beings. And we hold onto the goal because the goal is cool, because solving a puzzle is fun, because doing hard work and experiencing the reward from that is affirming, but your value as a human being is unshakable. Now, as a father, isn't that the feeling you want your child to have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):
Absolutely. And there's a lot of parenting advice these days that helps you learn to do that. There's all these TikToks now, don't say good job. Just say good choice or great, hard work. Great job working hard on that.

Jerry Colonna (00:39:04):
Right, right, right. I don't know how I feel about getting parenting advice from TikTok, but okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:12):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Andrew Luo (00:39:19):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:21):
So what is new with OneSchema, I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.

Andrew Luo (00:39:37):
Yes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema file feeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?

Andrew Luo (00:40:11):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:32):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:40:46):
Just to close loop on this, I think as people hear this, I feel like, okay, cool, everything falls apart. Sure, my parents will love me, my wife will love me, they won't think less of me. However, it's nice to get that really nice couch and that nice hotel and the income, the comfort that comes with income at a certain level is hard to give up. How do you help people get past that that might go away and feel comfortable?

Jerry Colonna (00:41:09):
Well, the good news is, and again, this is a Buddhist reference. The good news is there's a wisdom tradition that teaches all about this. So very briefly, the Buddhist story is in his mid-30s, he wakes up to the truth of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Birth, old age, sickness and death. And he wanders into the forest and he becomes a wandering mendicant and he becomes a holy man, and he's still not satisfied. And as I like to tell the story, one day he decides, fuck it, I'm just going to sit under the Bodhi tree and I'm not going to move until I figure this shit out. And so, he sits and sits and sits, and the story is he sat for 40 days living on a single grain of rice every day because always right, crazy stuff.

(00:42:05):
And when he woke up, he woke up to the four noble truths and the four noble truths are life is filled with suffering, that which we do to push away suffering increases suffering. The third noble truth is that there's an end to suffering. That's a really important one. And the fourth noble truth is what's known as the eightfold path to the end of suffering.

(00:42:34):
So let's focus on the second noble truth because that's really what you're talking about. When we acquire that nice couch, when we buy that nice house that stretches our income to its maximum, if we're doing it to enjoy the couch or the house, then A-OK. But if we're doing it because we're trying to push away the suffering of am I good enough to be loved, to feel safe, and that I belong, that which we do to push away suffering will increase suffering. And in this case, oh my God, what if they take my house away from me? Oh my God, what if I fall backwards down that staircase of life? Oh my God, what if all of those people who have signed up to my Substack suddenly disappear? You see how the attachment becomes that source of suffering? You see how the thing that we do to make ourselves feel better in fact fuels the tenuous hold that we have on our OK-ness? I'm okay just as I am. I'm okay.

(00:44:03):
It all comes down to why we're doing what we're doing. Now, to be clear, this is hard for me. I think it's hard for everybody. When my first book came out, Dan Harris, who's a really good friend and client from 10% Happier said to me, "Don't read the Amazon reviews." The truth is, I've read two reviews. I read it in the first hour after it was released, and I've never read a review since because there's no way I can experience those reviews without becoming attached to how people feel. So thank you. I'll put it over here and I'll just stay focused on the experience that I get from writing.

(00:45:04):
And yes, do I want to sell thousands of books? Do I want people to feel moved by my writing? I do, but you know who gets the most out of my writing? Me, because when I sit down, this is my file folder for whatever I might do for our next book, what I'm trying to do is answer questions that I have. For example, Captain Chaos is running the country right now. What is it that the world is going to need two or three years from now? And what's my contribution to that world? Now, just as I say that, how does that feel to you? It's kind of settling. So I know that in order for me to feel good about my existence on this planet, I have to ask myself these questions and I have to attempt to answer these questions. Whether it turns into a book that people buy or not is secondary, I have to do this work regardless.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:22):
That super connects with exactly again, the way I started this whole thing is I started writing just to crystallize my own thinking, and it ends up being useful to other people.

Jerry Colonna (00:46:33):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):
People hear this and they're like, why would I want to give up this great couch and house and car and all these things? That's really hard. And risking that by just doing something that feels good versus it'll make income, but it actually works. That's what I found. If you focus on a thing that is useful to yourself and interesting and not come at it from how do I make the most amount of money and turn this into whole thing, but more just, this is really interesting. I'm going to see where this goes. It will work for me.

Jerry Colonna (00:47:00):
Lenny, you implicitly asked a how question a few minutes ago. How do I do this? How do I do this radical self-inquiry? And I asked, I responded by offering a few questions. Let's build upon that for a moment, because what you are articulating right now is in the process of asking those questions, you can go back to what Simon Sinek would say is your why. You could go back to your core principle. You could go back to the centerpiece within you, which is what do I believe to be true about the world and how do I want to be in that world? You know what animates me right now is a question? With my children being fully fledged adults, I am really focused on what kind of ancestor to my descendants would I like to be? 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, I'll be gone. What would I like those who follow after me to believe to be true about me?

(00:48:11):
And you just paused. I can tell from the Adam's apple jumping up and down, that that question landed for you. It's a question of legacy. It's a question of meaning and purpose. At the end of my days, this is a question in Reboot, at the end of my days, what would I like the people who come after me to say about me? And what I want people to say about me is that he gave a shit about the world, he cared, and he tried, and he was kind. Those are the things that matter to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:00):
I'm always reminded of that frame of reference when I go to a funeral and people reading the eulogy and the old advice of what do you want your eulogy to say and making that your mission. But on the flip side, there's this viral video of Mike Tyson. Someone was coming up to him I think before his big match recently, and asked him about his legacy, and he's like, "I don't give a shit about my legacy. It's just a made up thing that doesn't matter." So let me just ask you this. Why is it important to think about legacy? Does legacy even matter? We're dead. What's the difference?

Jerry Colonna (00:49:33):
Far be it for me to criticize Mike, and don't hit me Mike, because even as an old guy, I wouldn't want to be hit by Mike Tyson. I don't know what's behind his response, but I can tell you what's true for me. I made oblique reference to Captain Chaos in the world as it is right now. The world's a tough place right now. We live in a world where it's almost normalized that a teenager will shoot other teenagers in school. It's almost normalized that people are dragged off to jail. Something is happening, something that's really disturbing.

(00:50:28):
Now, to be clear, we've always had disturbing times. I mean, I was reminded recently, I'm reading a book called Soldiers and Kings, which I highly recommend, which is about human smuggling from Central America into the United States, and it's an extraordinary book. And in reading that, I was reminded of policies that the US government has used over the years, whether it's supporting dictators in Central America or other sorts of things, things that I oppose, that feel immoral, if not directly immoral.

(00:51:15):
Why does this come up for me? I can't shake the feeling that someone down the line in my lineage is going to ask of me, "And what did you do, grandpa? And what did you do, great grandpa?" I know what I want that answer to be, which is I tried. Lenny, God gave me the ability to put two sentences together in a way that people listen. I feel a moral responsibility to use that God-given gift to help create the world, that I would like to see, a world of kindness and empathy, a world where poverty is diminished, a world where people feel safe however the fuck they identify. I don't give a damn. So is that my legacy? Yeah, and maybe there's some ego implicit in that, but can I go on for just a bit on this?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:54):
Absolutely.

Jerry Colonna (00:52:55):
At the end of Reboot, I write about this moment, and in this moment I am in Marin County. My wife Allie and I are together. And I'm once again torturing myself with this question. Have I been a good man? I drive myself crazy with that question. Have I been a good father? Have I been a good partner? Have I been a good man? And she says, in a very frustrated way, "All right, already. Enough. You're a good man. Stop." And so, I go for a walk, and as I'm walking, I encounter this toppled over oak tree and the roots are all torn up and you've seen trees like this, and clearly the tree died and clearly a wind came and clearly knocked the whole thing down. And I look at the tree and I say to myself, "Here lies a good man."

(00:53:57):
And I liken myself to this toppled over oak tree, and I imagine that that tree had lived its life with its limbs gnarled and twisted by actions that it should have taken and actions that it shouldn't have taken, but good choices and bad choices. But that for the majority of its 75, 80 years, it lived into its purpose of providing shelter and shade for those that may have come from beneath it. And I make this point that at the end of my days, I want to be like this tree just slowly dissolving into the earth, having done the best job I could of being purposeful. I feel better. My suffering is eased when I can lean into that, which then makes me able to be present for the other person, whether it's a coaching client, whether it's a podcast conversation, whether it's just going for a walk with one of my children. I just feel better, and I think I am a better person when I think about things like that. So far be it from me to disagree with Mike Tyson, but I think he's wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:34):
Good callback. It sounds like The Giving Tree to me.

Jerry Colonna (00:55:38):
Oh, yes, yes. Shel Silverstein.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:43):
To give people something to do with this area of legacy. How did you approach coming up with figuring out what you wanted your legacy to be? Are there some questions you asked? Is there something you recommend folks do to help think through this for themselves?

Jerry Colonna (00:55:57):
Well, it's delightful that we've ended up here because I think that I'm still working through those questions. As I said before as we both connected with, I use my writing to find my way to answers to questions. So part of what I'm dealing with right now is, look, I'll turn 62 this year. That feels old, but it also feels settled. And part of what I'm trying to figure out is what do I want my elderhood to be like? And I'll be honest, I'm enjoying this time of my life where I'm finding myself being a voice of comfort, being a voice of maybe even sanity in a time where that feels really insane and challenging. So maybe that's what my legacy will be. I'm not 100% sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:03):
Is this maybe hinted the new book you're working on? Is this the topic you're thinking about or is this not?

Jerry Colonna (00:57:09):
Yeah, and other things. That's right. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:15):
Speaking of the world being very crazy right now, you talked about your kids, AI is very top of mind for a lot of people in particular. It's stressing a lot of people out. In a lot of ways, it's quite unsettling in future careers, in skills, people-

Jerry Colonna (00:57:29):
It is unsettling, isn't it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):
Quite unsettling, but there's a world where we don't need humans in the future, potentially. Just what advice do you share with clients to help them work through this period of worry with the future, with AI being the core of it?

Jerry Colonna (00:57:45):
Well, if we go back to the equation for a moment, I think it's really important that we actually talk about these things. I would say a year ago, I likened it to the experience that I had. Remember, I'm old enough to remember when not everything had an IP address. Now, our refrigerators have IP addresses. I mean, it's freaking crazy. I'm old enough to remember when you had to install an IP stack into your personal computer in order to connect to the web. That's how old I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:22):
Did you have the phone modem where you had to put the phone?

Jerry Colonna (00:58:26):
Absolutely. Absolutely. It was a big, big deal to go from 1,200 baud to 2,400 baud to 56K. Oh my God, it was like a rocket ship. A year ago, I thought we were going through a similar kind of transition. We're clearly not. This is different. And in the coaching therapeutic world, everybody's like, "Oh my God, ChatGPT is going to replace me." And I don't know, maybe. What I am finding is... I wear glasses. So for those of you who are only listening to the audio, you may find that news. What I am finding is in my own life, it's like I have put on a pair of glasses that are really, really sharp and helpful, and it is disturbing and unsettling because I think it does challenge this question of what is our role as human beings?

(00:59:46):
Now, what I come back to, and I could be wrong, but what I come back to is we're talking through a medium, a mediated experience. My signal is bouncing up into the sky and to a satellite. I won't name the company, it's coming back down. I don't know what your access is. We're using this platform or a site to record this, but somehow we're still finding the capacity to be present for one another in a heart-to-heart way.

(01:00:30):
And so, when I look at these phenomena, what I lift up is that. What I am hopeful about is that that which does not matter in the experience of being human gets burned away and is taken care of, call it by AI, but that that which matters, which is presence and connection, human-to-human contact, strategic thinking, formulation, you want to talk about it in terms of engineering, the conceptualization, that that gets elevated and our skills get better at doing that. And in the most optimistic point of view, what ends up happening is we spend more time on that which matters, and less time on that which doesn't matter. And I could be completely wrong and we could all be out of work and making sure that the robots are well-oiled, and that becomes our purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:47):
Along these lines of glasses and even coaching, the world of coaching, there's a really interesting use case I saw today that Dan Shipper shared that I think you'd love, which is now that ChatGPT has memory, remembers everything you've said, and you can think back, you can ask it, "What are blank spots in the way I see the world that I'm not seeing?" You could also upload all your chat transcripts from your meetings and ask it what could you do better in meetings?

Jerry Colonna (01:02:14):
Look, one of my colleagues in the coaching company, he has uploaded, he kept all of his journal entries, I think over 10 years journal entries from Evernote, and he uploaded that. I think he uses Claude, and he's asked Claude to highlight things. What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? He's asked it to reflect back, and I think it's been incredibly helpful for him. I think the result is that he is a better coach, which is interesting, because the feeling is, well, does this replace it? I am finding, I'm using ChatGPT really as a writing and thinking partner in a way that I did not have before, and I'm still using my live real human writing buddies, which are really important to me. Where does this all end up? I had no idea. It is unsettling, it's uncanny, and it's also enlivening and exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:31):
Well put. I love that you can ask these hard questions of Claude/ChatGPT, these questions that make you really scared could ask it what are the answers, and even not have to do the hard work and maybe get a better answer. I doubt that that will give you the best answers.

Jerry Colonna (01:03:47):
Well, what it might do, which I think would be wonderful, is it might give you more questions to ask yourself. I'm a huge fan of powerful questions and the answer I give to a question like what am I not saying that I need to say? That question, you can ask yourself that question every single day. The question of how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? You can ask yourself that question every single day. To take a step back, the subtitle of my first book is Leadership in the Art of Growing Up. The Art of Growing Up is a practice. It's not a scientific moment where one day you wake up and you're done. It's an ongoing practice of not continuous improvement, but continuous inquiry that can feel exhausting when you contemplate it, but enlivening when you live it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
All this, some people may think of as this whole idea of growth mindset. I know that you're not a big fan of this term, that it's used in a harmful way a lot of times. Can you just talk about that why you find that growth mindset as a concept isn't necessarily useful?

Jerry Colonna (01:05:18):
Here's what I have a problem with. First of all, having a growth mindset is a very, very helpful thing. What I have a problem is in having and how we can turn a notion like a growth mindset into a fixed mindset, which is, it's this funny little trick the ego does, and the ego says, "Okay, well, this is a growth mindset. Oh, this is not a growth mindset. Okay, then this is good. This is not good. This is bad. This is..." What Buddhism has taught me is that everything's falling apart all the time even our growth mindset. When we get too fixed on the proper way to do things, we're setting ourselves up for attachment and therefore suffering. So if you can hold something like a mindset loosely with that attachment, go for it. Have a blast. Enjoy it. But the minute you start to nail it down to the floor and say this is the way it ought to be, I ought to always have a growth mindset, you've become fixed. And that's what the ego does.

(01:06:48):
To be more explicit about it from a business context for example, the great business writer Peter Senge says, "It is virtually impossible to challenge the assumptions that made you rich in the first place." So think about it in our experience of starting a business. We have what the Zen Buddhist would say, beginner's mind, all things are possible. And then, we experience, you were talking about it a little before, a little bit of success, and the ego, which is so terrified of not having success, start to say, "Aha, this is the way to do it." And then, we start to deviate from that because life happens and then the anxiety starts. So the question is, how do you hold a growth mindset loosely knowing that you ought to stay present to the world as it is, respond to the changing dynamics, figure out what's next because that's the growth. So put succinctly, stay attached to the growth and hold mindset a little loosely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:07):
I love that. It reminds me of advice. I did a meditation retreat once, and there's always a sense with Buddhism, and it's interesting how often Buddhism and advice from Buddhist teachings comes up on this podcast by the way.

Jerry Colonna (01:08:18):
When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. You are inviting it in, but keep going.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:25):
That makes sense as you say that. Interesting. So there's this fear I think people have with Buddhist teachings that you will not be as ambitious and you will not achieve as much if you're not attaching.

Jerry Colonna (01:08:41):
If you're not anxiously chasing something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):
Yeah, exactly. If you're just like, "Why do I need that? I don't need to be the CEO of the VP because like, oh, I won't attach to that." And then, so people fear that downside. So I asked this question at this retreat and the advice they shared there was don't attach to this idea, but just point your cart in that direction and head there.

Jerry Colonna (01:09:02):
Yeah, I like that. Look, the fear you're talking about is the fear of complacency. And if we look at the structures of the mind and we look at our socialization, the way we're socialized to ward off complacency is anxiety. And so, if we go back to some of the things we were saying before, if I grow up believing that the way I'm going to make my parents love me is by achieving, then if I become complacent, then what's at risk is their love for me. So just like we made the connection before where unconditional love exists, unconditional positive regard for self, otherwise known as self-compassion can be a powerful motivator, especially when you get to the point where you say, "As painful as it is for me to write, I enjoy writing. I enjoy working out. I enjoy pushing myself. I don't necessarily enjoy it in the moment." But I certainly, when I look at two books on my desk and I say, "You know what? That feels good. That makes me happy."

(01:10:43):
To me, the ability to hold the seeming contradiction of those things is a hallmark of my adulthood. It's to get satisfaction out of hard work for me is a much greater motivator than fear of complacency. As I've sort of slip-slided my way into that place, I have found... I work seven days a week. I don't have to, but I enjoy it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):
There's another, maybe a last area I want to spend some time on, which is around teams and what often causes trouble for teams. What breaks teams? What breaks companies? You have this point, you make that it's rarely lack of talent on the team, lack of strategy, lack of execution, that it's something else. What is that something else? What often do you find as the source of the problem for teams that aren't working?

Jerry Colonna (01:11:56):
Well, it's the unresolved, I'll be dramatic with the language, demons from their childhood. It's the unsorted baggage. Here's what happens. Teams are groups, and there are group dynamics that always happen. There is the scapegoat, there is the truth-teller who has to say, "Let me tell you what's really wrong with everything going on." Without the individual's radical self-inquiry skills, groups tend to be condemned to repeating patterns oftentimes of their family of origin.

(01:12:40):
I'll tell you a quick story. There's a very famous software blogger, blogger-owned software that I coached for many years, and we were doing an executive team meeting, and something happened in the group as we were talking that I observed once, twice, and three times, and finally, I said, "Okay, guys, I'm seeing something happen here. Every time we get close to talking about something that's really painful, somebody makes a joke and all the energy disappears and everybody laughs and everybody's nice." And as soon as I said it, my client who was CEO at the time said, "Jesus Christ, that's just like my family." It was like, yes, that's just like your family.

(01:13:35):
Carl Jung once said, "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." Let's apply it here. Until you make conscious the unconscious patterns operating in the group, the group will continue to repeat those patterns and you will blame somebody in the group. Romantic relationships from a Buddhist perspective, part of what we do in romantic relationships is we find the perfect foil for us to work out our unconscious phenomena. When we join a group, when we form up in teams and organizations, we are unconsciously finding the perfect foils for us to work out our own shit. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power in the group. If that person refuses to do their work, the entire group will become a manifestation of early dysfunction in the individual's lives. Does that make any sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:59):
100%. And this comes up a number of times on this podcast, just the impact the leaders issues have on the rest of the team, and also just this idea that the conditions they're trying to avoid are the conditions they invite in because they're avoiding.

Jerry Colonna (01:15:14):
That's it. That's it. One of my favorite teachers and dear friends is Parker Palmer, and he builds on, I think it was Socrates who said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." And he builds on that and makes a joke, and he says, "But if you choose to live an unexamined life, please don't take a job that involves other people." And that's it. You have a responsibility to examine your own shit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:43):
So say you're on this team, so there's two sides of this. You're on a team, the leaders clearly got some stuff that they need to work through, but they're not. Is there something you can do there other than just, "Hey, please, this is hurting us?" And then from the leader's perspective listening to this, what should they do? Is it get a coach? What can you do?

Jerry Colonna (01:16:01):
So for the one who has less power?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:04):
Yeah.

Jerry Colonna (01:16:05):
One of the things to ask oneself is what draws me to this position in the first place? How have I been complicit, not responsible in creating the conditions I say I don't want. How have I benefited from the dysfunction that exists in this organization? And benefit is a funny word. It doesn't necessarily mean I'm making more money. It means, for example, a benefit might be, boy, this feels familiar. I always find myself working on teams that are dysfunctional in this way. What is there in that experience for me to learn? So that's one thing.

(01:16:55):
You asked about the person who has power. You were using the word leader. I will talk about power, and you threw out, well, should they get a coach? Let's put it into larger context. Should you examine your life with radical self-inquiry? Yes. I would argue that the more power you have, the more moral responsibility you have to actually pause and figure out what it is that you're doing to be complicit in creating the conditions you say you don't want.

(01:17:28):
To be a very quick example what I'm talking about. A couple of years ago, I was doing a talk at a venture firm's CEO portfolio summit, the portfolio company's CEO summit. And we're sitting in a room, and of course I'm walking around again with shoes off and whatever, and people are firing questions at me. And one woman says, "Well, I'm the CEO of this 15-person company, and I have a question for you. Why is it that nobody on my team can make a decision without me?" And I said, "Who hired them?" And she, "Well..." I said, "Okay, how does it make you feel when they make a decision that you disagree with?" She said, "I'm furious." "Well, how can you hire people whom you expect to make decisions without running them through you if you can't tolerate them making a decision that you disagree with?"

(01:18:37):
You want to build a scaled leadership team, you have to be willing to have them make boneheaded decisions. And that's really, really hard, especially if we're "in founder mode" driving all the decisions. So that's your growth edge. We were talking about before about growth mindset. That's your growth edge. How can I be with the people in my life making boneheaded decisions about something that I care so much about and what is the best way for me to be in relationship about that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):
So much of this comes back to that question we started this with of just how are you complicit in creating the conditions you don't want? A big takeaway for me here, and it just keeps coming up and again and again, is if you're struggling as a leader, if your company's not working as well as you wanted to, if you're having a hard time with your team, going back to that equation, it's not about building more skills like public speaking skills or email skills, or I don't know, financial skills. It's self-awareness, radical self-inquiry, understanding what drives you, what makes you happy. Is that generally correct?

Jerry Colonna (01:19:51):
Lenny, I was just going to say, you just made me so happy you saying what you just said. Yes. I've been coaching now, as I said for a couple of decades. Before that, I was a VC for 15, 17 years. What you just said is the wisdom of my 40 years as an adult. That's it. This is why radical self-inquiry is so damned important because it leads to a little bit less suffering and a lot more resilience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:28):
For folks that want to actually do that, well, they can rewind back to the middle of the episode where we actually ask the questions that are associated with the radical self-inquiry, and then obviously if they want to dig deeper, they can buy your book.

Jerry Colonna (01:20:41):
Or 10 copies of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:43):
Or 100 copies for everyone at the company willing to Amazon. Jerry, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think is really important for people to hear maybe as the last piece of wisdom?

Jerry Colonna (01:20:57):
Now one of the hopes that I have you ask me at the start like what would be my hope is that we ended up being closer and friends, and I feel that. Let me extend that out to everybody. What I always hope from all of these intimate conversations that I try to do in podcasts is that people walk away going, "Geez, I'm not alone." We've made different references to the fact that it's a hard time. The truth is it's always a hard time. And what makes it hardest is to feel like I'm the only one who's going through this. So what I appreciate about what you do, Lenny, is that under the guise of talking about product, you're really talking about the process of being human. And that is a mitzvah. That's a good deed. And so, I hope in the process of listening to this, people walk away going, "Okay, I feel a little bit better today."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:04):
I really appreciate that. The way I think about these sorts of conversations and episodes, I call them Trojan Horse episodes where people come for the other stuff, tactical, practical stuff, and then they get stuff they really need to hear. And so, I appreciate you. Jerry, thank you so much for being here.

Jerry Colonna (01:22:19):
Thank you for having me. It was a delight.

# Building a world-class data org | Jessica Lachs (VP of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
So you've built one of the largest and most respected data teams in all of tech.

Jessica Lachs (00:00:05):
For me, analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function, not just answering the why, but answering the, "What do we do now that we know this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
One of your colleagues told me that you are incredibly good at defining metrics.

Jessica Lachs (00:00:19):
Retention is a terrible thing to goal on. It's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
You mentioned the early team. I felt extreme ownership.

Jessica Lachs (00:00:34):
Yes, you are a data scientist, but your goal is to figure out what's happening. And if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers, then that is what you're going to do to roll up your sleeves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
Today my guest is Jessica Lachs. Jessica is Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, which has built one of the biggest and most impactful data teams in tech. She's been at DoorDash for over 10 years and was the first GM at DoorDash responsible for launching new markets. Previously, Jessica founded GiftSimple, a social gifting startup and began her career in investment banking at Lehman Brothers.

(00:01:11):
In our conversation, we go deep on how to build and scale your data org, including why a centralized org model is so effective. What to look for when hiring data people, how to pick the right metrics for teams to align incentives and drive the right sorts of outcomes. Examples of how the data team at DoorDash has helped the business make better decisions, a bunch of great stories about the early days of DoorDash and a ton more.

With that, I bring you Jessica Lachs. Jessica, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jessica Lachs (00:01:55):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:58):
So you've built one of the largest and most respected data teams in all of tech. I've heard from a number of people that look to you for advice when they're trying to build and scale their data teams. And then DoorDash in particular is an incredibly complex business. There's three or maybe even four sites to the marketplace. There's this operational element. From the outside, it just feels extremely complicated and wild. I imagine from the inside it's even more wild. Let's talk about some of the things you've learned about building and scaling the team. You have a fairly contrarian perspective on how to structure data teams. This was referenced when we had Elizabeth Stone on the podcast too. She approaches data the same way. So I'd love to hear just your take on how to structure data teams within companies.

(00:02:42):
 This episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset. It should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions. That's business 101. But here's a number for you. 54% of leaders say web updates take too long. That's over half of you listening right now. That's where Webflow comes in. Their visual-first platform allows you to build, launch, and optimize webpages fast. That means you can set ambitious business goals and your site can rise to the challenge. Learn how teams like Dropbox, IDEO, and Orangetheory trust Webflow to achieve their most ambitious goals today at webflow.com.

(00:03:30):
This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams, and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive, and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.

(00:04:04):
Most product managers will tell you, "Paperwork sucks." Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style, and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users paperwork often starts with an AI-powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag-and-drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy-to-understand documentation.

Jessica Lachs (00:04:59):
There's two main things that I think are important when you're structuring a team. The first is I believe that analytics should have a seat at the table just like engineering and product and the business folks, the operators. For me, analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function. I think there are analytics teams at other companies where they are answering people's questions, maybe even through Jira tickets, we're building dashboards. That was never really of interest to me. That wasn't the team that I wanted to build.

(00:05:35):
For me, it's about finding opportunities, about having a point of view on the decisions that we should make, not just answering the why but answering the so what. "So what do we do now that we know this?" And so that's definitely one thing as far as my point of view on building a data team. I think the second thing which may be a little more contrarian is I think there are people out there who think that analytics should be embedded into business units. I strongly disagree. I believe a central model, a center of excellence is superior and I'm happy to talk about why, but that's something that I feel quite strongly about. We've tried it or I shouldn't... well, we've experimented in the past with the alternative, so putting it into a business unit and it's just much more problematic and I think the value you get from a central model is far greater than some of the things that you might lose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:36):
Yeah, let's definitely talk about it. And just to make sure people understand, when you say central versus embedded, is that in terms of reporting lines, in terms of their goals?

Jessica Lachs (00:06:44):
It's a great question. So mostly it's in terms of reporting lines because I think on the goal side, that is something where we have the same goals that our partner teams have, and I think that that's actually an important part of a successful central model. So when I say central model, it just means that for marketing analytics, marketing analytics is part of the broader analytics team. It does not sit and report in through marketing. Just to clarify.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:13):
Got it. So the reporting functions at some companies, there's the head of marketing or some partners to the head of marketing where the data, say, analyst or biz ops people or data scientists would report potentially to them and that's it. And they're not as connected to the core, to the rest of the data team, the rest of the analytics team versus-

Jessica Lachs (00:07:30):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:31):
Yeah.

Jessica Lachs (00:07:31):
So you'd have a bunch of smaller, of course, data teams that sit embedded within the functions. And I understand why business leaders like that. You're embedded within the function, so you're a part of the team. That ownership, that camaraderie that comes with that, I think you can solve for that. But I do understand that that is a benefit. I think the other benefit of course is the business leaders control the roadmaps so they get to dictate the work. They know that they have help and resources in that area when they need them. So that certainty, that control, I totally understand the value there, but I think that those are two things that you can solve for if you know that those are the biggest issues with a central team. So for us, we have a central analytics team, but we are divided up into pods that map perfectly with how product engineering, operations marketing are structured as well.

(00:08:33):
And so our team de facto has these folks embedded with our partner teams, even though the reporting structure is up through a central org through me. And that helps the team to feel like they are one team, both in terms of the analytics team feeling like it's one team, but also to use the marketing example, the marketing folks are one team and because the analytics shares the same goals as the marketing leaders, your incentives are aligned to work on the most important things and your success is their success and vice versa. So I think that that's been really a happy medium, but still preserves all the benefits of a central org. And there are a lot of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):
I want to hear about them, but I think something that some people may think when you say essential org is like a silo data team that sits there and they're like a service org a little bit within the company. It's like, "Hey, I need some data help." And you try to convince that, "Hey, I need some help on this thing." And that's not what you're saying.

Jessica Lachs (00:09:41):
Oh, no. No, no, no. That job seems terrible. I don't want that job. No, to the earlier point, we have a seat at the table. We are business partners, we are thought partners with our product counterparts, with our engineering counterparts, with our ops counterparts, and we again, share the same goals and have the same initiatives that they do. And it's just our job to come at it from a data-driven place. We bring to the table insights on things that we've noticed, deep dives that we do to understand the problems that we're trying to solve better. If we need to grow, what are the most efficient ways to grow? What are the trade-offs that we have to make? Where are their pockets of opportunity? That is what I expect my team to be able to bring to that table, the proverbial table, that we want to see that. And in order to earn their spot, that's the deal. We get the seat at the table and we need to earn it by bringing opportunities that we all can go and go after.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:52):
Awesome. So in a sense, it is embedded. They're embedded in cross-functional teams across the org, but they report up to essential org to you essentially in the end?

Jessica Lachs (00:11:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):
Cool. What are some of the benefits of this approach?

Jessica Lachs (00:11:05):
Oh, there's so many. Okay, so the first thing is a consistent and high talent bar. I think this is something I saw when we would have some pockets of analytics folks embedded is having a consistent bar for talent in terms of what we're looking for, what are the technical skills, what are the soft skills? And being able to evaluate candidates with that same bar, using our same rubric. You just get more consistent and higher talent in my opinion. I think that's number one. Number two is actually growth opportunities. So if you're siloed, you may be the most senior data person within... I keep picking on marketing. But you might be the most senior data scientist within marketing. Where do you go from there? I think when you have the central org, you're able to see if there are growth opportunities in other areas within the company.

(00:12:04):
And so that really helps folks to stay engaged because they can look at new problems if the problems they've been working on for several years are getting maybe boring and they want something new, there's an opportunity, move from marketing over to merchant analytics. And then I think similarly, if there isn't a promotion or room to grow, if you want to be a people manager and there just isn't a people management role within your functional area, well, you've got 10 other ones to look at and maybe there is that opportunity. So I think it helps with the growth opportunities for the team, which helps to retain talent. So that's a second thing. The third thing is just consistency of methodologies and metrics. So you don't have sales that was as defined by one team and sales as defined by another team. You just have sales and everybody is using the same metrics, the same methodologies, and you're able to improve your methodologies with input from more people.

(00:13:10):
And rather than recreating the wheel, building the same churn prediction model on six different teams. You can instead build one and have the input of six different teams. I think that's definitely another benefit. Also helps you just scale because you start to see the same problems across teams and so you're like, "Ooh, this is an issue that we need to get ahead of. This is something we need to automate," or, "This is something that we need to improve upon," or, "a problem that is going to grow as our business, as our teams scales." So I think it helps you see around corners a little bit more.

(00:13:45):
And then just lastly, there's a team culture brand. I think that's really important, not just externally for recruiting top talent, but the team is really proud to be members of the analytics team. We have a unique culture of learning, of sharing. You have someone you can go to talk about your challenges. You have someone who can peer review your work. I think just having that team culture that we have is really important. And it's a lot harder to get when you have the individual silos, particularly in an earlier stage when it's a smaller team, you just don't have as many people around. Everybody wants to have friends at work and we're creating an environment where they can find like-minded data nerds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:33):
It makes me think about Airbnb's first data team. I don't know if you know Riley Newman well, but he built Airbnb's first data team and it was actually an analytics team. They called themselves the 'A-Team' on the point of culture, and that always felt a lot of fun and they loved being part of that team.

Jessica Lachs (00:14:49):
Yeah. We have the same, but now I feel a lot less special for coming up with that name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
Oh, you called it A-Team also?

Jessica Lachs (00:14:56):
Yeah, we got the A-Team, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
And then I think they moved away from it when there was a push. Now we're data scientists, we're not analytics or analysts. And that was like, I don't know, 10 year ago, like [inaudible 00:15:08] data science. We're data scientists.

Jessica Lachs (00:15:09):
We'll always be the A-Team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):
There's so many threads I want to follow here, one that's a tangent, but something that I think a lot of people struggle with is you talked about how you want your data team, your analytics team to be proactive, to find opportunities, to give you ideas, to help you figure out what to build, not just answer questions. At the same time, there are many questions that teams need to get answered. Do you have any advice for just how to set up a team where they both find time to explore, dig, show opportunities and come up with big ideas and also, "Hey, we just need to figure out the funnel conversion on this thing," or "Hey, what do you think? What's happening in China right now?" Thoughts there?

Jessica Lachs (00:15:47):
Yeah, such a good question. I think it's something that never gets easier. You have to be very intentional to carve out time for exploratory work for deep dives because as you mentioned, there are always more questions and more work to be done than hours in the day. And so I think being intentional about it and setting goals for your team around finding these insights through self-directed work is an important mechanism for holding ourselves accountable to that goal because it tends to be the first thing that goes when you get a lot of inbounds, you're like, "All right, well, let's deep dive on something that I don't know if it's really something. It could be high ROI, it could be low ROI, I don't know." So the expected value is lower than this known thing that I can deliver and make someone happy.

(00:16:42):
So I think to prevent that time from just slipping away, you really have to be intentional. We would do hackathons for our team to carve out days to just go and look into these really interesting things and find opportunities. And I think we have the support of our business partners because so many great insights have come from these deep dives and it really has been some of the work that drives future roadmaps. So they're always really great at allowing us to have this time and actually encourage us often to have this time for some self-directed work, to go find the next big opportunity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:23):
If there's no answer that comes to mind, that's totally cool. But is there an example of one of these insights that someone on the data team came up with that led to something big for DoorDash that you're able to share?

Jessica Lachs (00:17:35):
So one interesting example was from a hackathon we did a couple of years ago where we were looking at referral as a channel for consumer acquisition. And when you compare that channel to others, it was below average in terms of the engagement you'd see from consumers who came through that channel and the payback period. And rather than just lowering spend on referrals and moving right along, we really wanted to understand what was happening. And so during the hackathon, we did a deep dive into referral. We actually tried referring each other. We tried committing referral fraud, creating new accounts to get around rules. And we uncovered a lot of fraudulent behavior through this deep dive. We ordered so many cupcakes to the office. I remember using referral credits because you had to place an order to be able to get the referral bonus. So we would create the account, place the orders, and we just kept ordering cupcakes.

(00:18:39):
And what we noticed was that referral as a channel was a bit misleading when you would look at the average in terms of payback and that it was really a bimodal distribution and you had one group of really great consumers who were referring other really great consumers, and the payback on those consumers was really strong. In fact, if that's all you saw, you would spend a lot more on that channel.

(00:19:08):
And then what was happening was you had this other group of consumers that were not as good people who were posting referral codes online and getting people who were just in it to get free discounts and credits. And we had at that point in time, pretty lax fraud rules. And we didn't have caps on these things. All of which came about from this deep dive where we found that this group of consumers was really a drag on the efficiency of this marketing channel. And so I think that's an example of a few things that we like to do at DoorDash. One being these deep dives and taking the time to really understand the problem and then ultimately make a bunch of recommendations for what we should do, including better fraud checks, caps on referrals, et cetera, et cetera. But also how the average can be incredibly misleading. And so looking at distributions and trying to break down what you're seeing to find ways that you can optimize in ways that you can gain in efficiencies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
That's an awesome story, great memory to come up with that one. So this is a really good example of a way to carve out time for the data team to think long-term, think look for opportunities, find big ideas. So the hackathon is one idea. Imagine many data people are struggling often to push back on asks that are just like, "h, we need to know. We just need this one thing. Here's a question, just answer this one question part." Do you have any advice to data to get better at pushing back? Sounds like a bit of cultural like, "We have time, we need to work on these bigger things." But just any advice for data leaders or data ICs to find time for these sorts of things?

Jessica Lachs (00:20:59):
Yeah, saying no to someone is never fun. I think as a self-proclaimed people-pleaser, you don't want to say no, especially when it's something you can do and you know that you can very easily with maybe an hour's work, make someone happy. I think it's really important to establish a culture and for leadership to really establish the rules of working and that operating model so that some of the junior folks aren't forced to always have to say no. And I think one of the ways we do that is through our goaling. So because our goals are the same as our business partners, we're able to pretty easily say, "Hey, we've got a limited amount of time. These are our goals. What are the most important things that we are going to work on this week or this month in order for both of us to hit our goals?"

(00:21:49):
And so when something comes up to be able to say, "Hey, this data poll that you want me to do, is this more important than these other three things that I was going to be working on? Yes or no?" And I think sometimes people don't necessarily realize the trade-offs, and when you make them apparent and you put them front and center, they realize that, "Oh, actually, you know what? That asset's not important. That can wait." So I think that that's definitely something I would recommend, which is always share the trade-offs. Don't suffer in silence with, "How am I going to do all four of these things?" Bring it up and say, "Hey, this is what I was planning to do. If you want me to do this extra new thing, then one of these other things is going to have to drop.

(00:22:36):
I personally don't think that your ask is more important than these three things, but maybe there's new information, maybe there's context I don't have, so let's talk about it." Rather than just being like, "No, I won't do that." That's not a great approach either. I think having the conversation and constantly reevaluating your prioritization to make sure you're working on the most important things or your team is working on the most important things is really good hygiene to have with your business partner. So some teams do that through a weekly standup like, "Here's what we're going to do this week. Do we like this prioritization? Do we not?" Some folks do it less formally than that. I think you got to figure out what works for you. But to the earlier point, it's a conversation with your engineering partner, your product partner, your ops partner, you're all on the same team, you're all trying to achieve the same goals and you're all incentivized to have your analytics team working on the most impactful things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:32):
This advice is great for any role basically. And if I were to summarize it to a couple words, it's just prioritize and communicate what your priorities are and then align on the trade-offs of shifting your priorities.

Jessica Lachs (00:23:45):
Every once in a while you just throw one over and say, "You know what? This is quick. I'll do it." At least I do. I think sometimes just knock it out, build some goodwill. I think that that's also important. But usually it's not something you can do in five minutes and in that case it's that ruthless prioritization for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):
And then there's also the side that you talked about of just show that you can provide value doing these things that are longer term, like prove your worth. "Hey, look at all these opportunities I found for our team over time, I should keep spending time on these other areas," versus the on fire stuff.

Jessica Lachs (00:24:18):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:19):
When you're hiring people for your team, I'm curious what you look for and you think is incredibly important that maybe other people aren't prioritizing as much. What do you focus on when you're hiring?

Jessica Lachs (00:24:31):
Yeah. So everybody needs to have a certain set of technical skills. I think that's a non-starter. We have a technical bar, we do a technical screen. So I think that's table stakes. There's some really unique characteristics that I've noticed when I look at some of the top talent that I've had on the team or have on the team. I think the first thing is just curiosity. You can't teach curiosity, or at least I haven't found a way to do it. If somebody else knows how, please let me know. Somebody who is just self-motivated to pull on the threads when they find them. So they don't just answer a question. They're like, "Hmm, this thing seems a little odd. I'm going to dig in and look. Even though I could say I'm done, I answered the question, I did the thing I was going to do." The person that has that curiosity, something seems off, something doesn't really make sense and goes and proactively looks into what that is. That is just so valuable. So I really look for that curiosity and that self-motivation to do it without being told.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:39):
How do you test for that? How do you do that in an interview and get a sense of if they're good at that?

Jessica Lachs (00:25:43):
One way you can do it through the questions you ask is have something that is not quite right within the case that you're presenting and see if people notice first and foremost. And even if they don't, if you point it out like, "Where do they go with that?" I think that that's something that you can test for. I think you can also ask for examples that for these folks typically will highlight this, they'll talk about, "I noticed this thing, and so we decided to investigate." So I think that there are ways that you can get that signal through the interview process, but it's really hard. I think testing for hard skills is a lot easier than testing for soft skills. And I think in some of the questions we ask, we'll ask a question with the idea that we're assessing something separate than what the question is necessarily asking. And I think that this is one example of where that really works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:47):
You said that you give them a case. What does that look like? What is the actual approach to how you do this interview?

Jessica Lachs (00:26:52):
Our interview process has in the early stages a coding exercise. So we do our technical screen and a shortened version of a business case. So real world problem solving. Typically, it's something actually from DoorDash history, like a real problem that we had to see how people can problem solve on the fly. I think that that's an important skill to be able to have, which is, how do you take a problem, break it down, talk through it. A little bit like some of those consulting cases that you hear about, but something that's really rooted in real problems. And I think you can learn a lot from those types of cases where, yes, you get to see how people handle ambiguity and structured problem solving, but ultimately most people get something wrong. They make an assumption that's wrong because well, I would hope that the interviewer knows the business better than the interviewee.

(00:27:56):
And seeing how people react to being told they're wrong is a really important signal in my opinion. Seeing how people respond, how they're able to take new information and pivot, how they're able to make a decision. So that's another thing that I like to see in cases where, hey, you may not know the real right decision. You might say, "Hey, I could see it going one way, I could see it going the other way." But I always push people to say, "If you had to make a call right now, what would it be?" So are people able to have a point of view without full information because that's life. Sometimes you have to just pick a direction and make a decision even though you don't have perfect information. So I like to see some of these softer skills and how they manifest throughout a case interview, even if it's not specifically what I'm asking with the literal problem we're solving in the case.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:57):
Along these lines, but in a different direction. You don't actually have a deep data science data background before you got into this stuff. I know you had some art background, you had an art portfolio back in school, and I think a lot of people wouldn't imagine that for someone being head of analytics for a company like DoorDash. I don't exactly know the question, but I guess is there anything there that you think would be interesting for people to know or hear?

Jessica Lachs (00:29:24):
Yeah, it's funny. I joke that I have a job I'd never be hired for because I don't have a traditional data science background. And I know that Elizabeth Stone on her podcast with you talked a lot about her non-traditional background for a CTO. So hey, maybe there's something to it. But I became a data scientist out of necessity. I completely self-taught in terms of SQL and Python and I did it because there was a need at DoorDash for someone to help figure out what the right goals were, how we set those goals, how we were performing different markets early in the DoorDash story, so 10 years ago at this point. And I think I just gravitated towards that type of work and Tony recognized that superpower in me even though I don't have that formal training. So yeah, I'm a bit of an artist for fun, but I guess a data scientist in practice or for career.

(00:30:31):
But I think that that non-traditional background has been a great thing because I'm able to hire people who have the technical skills that I don't have, the folks with PhDs in statistics and the data scientists, machine learning and otherwise. I am able to hire those folks and yet keep them really focused on driving business impact because my background was on the finance side, and so I've always been a pragmatist. And for me, the purpose of our team is to drive business impact. And so the mix between the technical skills of the smarter people that I've hired, the smarter than myself, and my grounding in driving business impact has been a really great partnership.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:21):
That's quite an inspiring story for someone that is just starting out and doesn't necessarily have a lot of experience in data, but also just generally. I think this is a really cool example. You could be successful in a field that you don't have a ton of background in. I'm curious what you think it was in you that allowed you to succeed in this and get to where you are today. What do you think you did right or what is some habits or ways of thinking that you think helped you achieve that?

Jessica Lachs (00:31:52):
First off, I have imposter syndrome like everybody else. So it's not like I have this crazy sense of confidence of like, "Oh, I can do anything." I definitely have the same doubts that others have. I think part of it was probably not even realizing what I was doing. When you're at a startup and things are moving quickly and you see a problem, and I've always liked solving problems, so I was like, "All right, how do I solve this problem?" It was like, "Oh, well, I need access to the data. I don't have access to the data. All right, I'll ask an engineer to get me the data. Well, this isn't going to scale. I can't always bother an engineer, so how do I figure out how to get the data myself? Well, let's learn Python." So I think it happened organically and I don't think I realized at the time what I was even doing.

(00:32:41):
And then I think if you think about things from first principles about what you need right now in front of you to unblock yourself or solve a problem, and you just focus on that instead of thinking about a global org that you're trying to build. I think that that helps. So for me, it was always about solving the problem in front of me the best way I could. And if that meant I needed to hire an engineer to report into me through the finance org, then that was what we were going to do and nobody was going to tell me I couldn't do it. So I think it's a belief in yourself, and ultimately it's just my desire to solve problems and figure out what has to get done is, I think, ultimately how it came about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:30):
I love that so much. There's so many elements there that I think a lot of people can learn from. I feel like there's also this underlying current of you're just motivated for this to work. You wanted DoorDash to succeed, and you're just like, "I will do what I need to do to make this happen. I need to solve these problems. I'm not going to overthink. Do I have the skills necessarily to do these things [inaudible 00:33:48]?"

Jessica Lachs (00:33:48):
Yeah, I think I'm competitive. I think that's a trait that you find in a lot of early DoorDash folks and current DoorDash folks, to be honest, just wanting to win and being willing to do whatever you need to win. So roll up your sleeves, do something that's not your job. I think back to early days of taking out the garbage on Saturday nights because it needed to get done. I think that that was something that is ingrained in our culture from Tony Xu, from our founder and CEO, and I think that really resonated with me, and I feel like I've always operated that way as well. And I think that that helped me in my career to be able to do what I've done without really thinking about it too much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:40):
Are there any other memories or stories of the early days of DoorDash that would be fun to share? Something that sticks with you of like, "Wow, I can't believe that's what it was like?"

Jessica Lachs (00:34:49):
Oh man, there's so many, including so many mistakes that we've made. But I think something that really stands out to me is before I moved to the analytics area, I was actually a GM. I was the first GM at DoorDash and I was in Boston in 2014 launching the city of Boston when nobody knew who we were. And we would wake up early in the morning, 5 A.M. and we would go out, it was the winter of 2014. We'd go out and we'd hand out promo codes consumers outside of the [inaudible 00:35:30] in Boston, and these promo cards would be attached to kind bars so people would take them. And the whole team, it was a small team, there were four of us, but the whole team would go out in the morning to do this. And I think back to our sales guy, shout out to Joey G. So Joe Graccio is our sales guy in Boston-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):
[inaudible 00:35:47] Joey G.

Jessica Lachs (00:35:51):
And he was gold on signing merchants on the platform.

(00:35:55):
That was how he was gold. His compensation was tied to that. And yet in the morning when we would go out, he was with us handing out promo codes because he was part of the team because he wanted to win. We wanted to grow the business. And I think that that is just a great example of the culture that Tony and the early employees and Stanley and Andy, other co-founders really instilled in all of us early in those days. So I think that that ownership, that extreme ownership of the outcome is definitely one of the things.

(00:36:32):
I think the other is just being very customer first. And I say customer, I mean consumers, dashers and merchants as all being our customers. And the first time I ever went to the office headquarters in Palo Alto, which at the time was in an animal hospital. The first time I went there, there was a huge site outage and the whole company, it was like 20 people at the time, the whole company jumped online to do customer support, to answer the phones, to make sure that folks were getting refunds for orders that weren't going through, make sure the orders that were out there were getting delivered, just dropped everything and hopped on to do support.

(00:37:15):
And I was brand new, didn't really know how to use the tools, and so it was like, "How can I be useful?" And so back in those days, we used to order dinner to the office using DoorDash. And so in order to preserve about three dashers who would've had to deliver food to us, I was like, "I'm going to go out, go out dashing, go get everyone pizza so that we could feed the masses doing credits and refunds and do what we had to to make sure that we were serving our customers well." And I think that night was one of the largest refunds as a percent of our bank account that we had ever given out. And I think Tony, there were two examples that he's talked about where we just gave a lot of money back to customers because it was the right thing to do because our service failed and we wanted to do right by them.

(00:38:06):
So I think that those are two stories that stick out in my mind and really highlight culturally what makes DoorDash unique and what I think has been a really important part of our success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:20):
It reminds me of the story that Tony and all the early employees, and I imagine you did this just like, "We're dashers," it's like a rotation where you dash for a while. Is that part of the culture?

Jessica Lachs (00:38:32):
Yeah, so we have a program, a WeDash program, and Keith Yandell, who's our chief business officer, did your podcast last year and he talked about this. But four times a year all the employees go out and go dashing or do customer support, and it's part of our culture that I love. I actually go pair dashing, so I go together with one of my colleagues. We've done it for years now, and it's a fun thing that we do together four times a year. Actually, usually more than that. And it's important because you get to use the product, you build empathy with all the audiences. I think all of us order DoorDash a lot, so we've built empathy with consumers. But being able to go and understand what it's like to go out dashing and when you're in the restaurant going and talking with merchants and seeing the experience from their point of view, I think it's just incredibly important. And of course we find a lot of bugs like, "Hmm, this doesn't work the way it should, let me report this." So I think it's also just great for catching bugs in the product.

(00:40:39):
I want to come back to a thread, something you mentioned where you and a lot of the early team had felt extreme ownership over the company and that's why a lot of this stuff happened. For people, every founder, every product team, they're going to like, "Yes, we need that. Let's make sure everyone on the team feels extreme ownership." Is there anything that you think that the early team did to create that or is it hiring, just pick people that will have that feeling already, or is cultural?

Jessica Lachs (00:41:05):
I think it's both. It's definitely cultural. I think it comes from the top and I think that Tony exhibits this extreme ownership and looks for it in others. So I think that helps. But I think even today I expect of my team that same extreme ownership over the outcomes. And so I'm more interested in our team figuring out how to solve a problem than the box that someone fits in like, "I'm a data scientist and so I only do these things." Right? It's like, "No. I mean, yes, you are a data scientist, but your goal is to figure out what's happening, and if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers, then that is what you're going to do." And I think that expecting that and setting that as the norm for the team, this ownership of the outcome is something that we continue to do at DoorDash and instill in everyone whether you were early or just joined last month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
Is there an example of that that comes to mind of someone practicing extreme ownership, like a data scientist calling someone or something along those lines?

Jessica Lachs (00:42:16):
Yeah, so I actually had a meeting yesterday morning with the team that's working on some of our affordability initiatives and we had shipped something that we expected to work, and it didn't. And instead of, "You can dig into the data," to understand the segments of consumers that you would expect it to work with and those that it wouldn't, of course we did that. But ultimately it was like, "I don't know why." And that's where qualitative research is superior to quantitative research, it's asking for the context, to actually talking to people to figure out what was the motivation, what worked, what didn't for them. And so the team, data scientists included, just sat and made phone calls. And so they were talking about what they found from those phone calls and that's going to inform future decisions. And I think rather than saying, "Well, that's what the qualitative research team is supposed to do," it's like, "No, no, no, that is what our team, anyone's team is supposed to do because that's what's needed to unblock us from this next test that we want to run because we need to know what we are testing."

(00:43:23):
So I think that it happens every day. I think I really love when I see team members go outside the traditional bounds of what a data science role might be and do some product management work, do some engineering work. I think that that's part of what keeps the job interesting. I think it's part of what makes our team special is that that is not only allowed, it's encouraged, and probably also a reason why we've had folks who've gone from my team to the product org and to the ops org and to the finance org is because they get to do and experience parts of that job and get a good sense for what that's like and then realize it's something that they love. So I think it's definitely something we encourage at DoorDash.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):
I love that. I want to move in a slightly different direction. One of your colleagues told me that you are incredibly good at defining metrics, which is so important to get right for a business, especially when it's complex at DoorDash. And I hear you're especially good at finding the right metric to drive the right incentive, especially when the business is really messy and things like that. So I'm just curious what you've learned about how to pick good metrics and align incentives well.

Jessica Lachs (00:44:45):
I've learned a lot of things about metrics, mostly from bad metrics. I actually think you learn a lot from picking the wrong metric. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output. So people always talk about, "Oh, we want to drive an improvement in retention." Retention is a terrible thing to goal on because it's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in the short term, and yet you want to be able to experiment and iterate quickly. So what are the things that drive retention? What are the inputs? So I think it's really important to find the right inputs, and then through experimentation test whether or not those short-term inputs are driving the long-term output that you're looking for. I think that's one thing. I think keeping things simple is another thing I've learned over the years, maybe it's data scientists, but they tend to love these composite metrics with a coefficient.

(00:45:44):
"We're going to wait this input at X and this input at X+2." And then you end up with a metric that nobody really understands that doesn't actually mean anything. And you're like, "I don't know if a 0.1 increase is it a lot? Is it good? Is it bad?" So they're just hard to work with.

(00:46:07):
And so I always encourage folks, just pick something simple, even if it's not perfect and your composite would be more perfect. If people understand it, if they have an intuition around it, if it's something that people can talk about across the company, it's going to be a much better metric in terms of driving real outcomes than your made up composite score that nobody understands. So I think keeping things simple is also really important. And then I think the last thing I'll say is it's important to understand how metrics across the company equate to one another.

(00:46:43):
And so we spend a lot of time quantifying things in terms of a common currency. So for example, if I were to lower price by a dollar, what would I get in terms of, we'll say, volume? Well, what if I lowered delivery times by a minute? What do I get for that in terms of volume? And so now you can make trade-offs between maybe your marketing team and your logistics team because you have this common currency that everyone can talk about. And so we've done that. We've tried to quantify all of the levers of our business, price, selection, quality in common terms, so that if we have, say, a dollar to spend, we know what we get depending on where we put it, over what timeframe. I think that that helps us make decisions more quickly because we know what our options are. We know we have our inventory of things that we can do, short-term, long-term, and what we get for it. So it definitely helps us to make decisions more quickly and hopefully better decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
These are so awesome. I definitely want to follow up on some of this. This is so good. So maybe on this last one, which we did at Airbnb also like, how does everything translate into Knight's book and booking? Every decision we make, what is the actual Knight's book impact? And so I imagine in your case, I don't know if you want to talk about these things. I imagine it's transactions, or purchases, or GMB or something like that, so I'm guessing is the final metric. I don't know. Is that something you talk about or you don't talk about that?

Jessica Lachs (00:48:26):
We measure things in terms of GOV, so Gross Order Value, and also volume.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:33):
Got it. [inaudible 00:48:34]. Okay, so basically every other metric that people are gold on as much as you can translate, there's a model that translates that into Gross Order Value and volume? Awesome. So when a team is saying, "Hey, we're going to change the onboarding flow and impact conversion here." I don't know. I guess what are some examples of other metrics on teams that potentially translate into GOV and volume just to make it even more real?

Jessica Lachs (00:49:01):
Yeah. So everything from the example that you started with, which is an improvement in the login flow, how many more consumers are getting onto the app and ultimately placing orders. And so you can translate that to, of course, orders and GOV. But then something as interesting as selling a Thai restaurant in Sacramento, we're able to say, "What do we think that that gets us in terms of GOV from the consumer by selling that Thai restaurant?" So it's every area of the business, it's mobilizing more dashers on the road. What does that do to our quality metrics in terms of delivery times? How does that translate? So because of that, we're able to figure out if we want to spend the dollar or spend the time, the team's time, on improving conversion or spending more money in marketing or onboarding more dashers or signing more restaurants or adding more grocery stores. So we are able to look across the whole business and figure out what is the right mix of actions to take to achieve our goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:18):
I could see as you talk about this why this is so important in a marketplace, especially a multi-sided marketplace where there's always trade-off decisions between supply investment and demand growth and dasher growth. I don't even know, my brain would explode trying to think about all these things, so I get exactly why this is so important to business. Okay. And then in terms of the simple recommendation, I think when people hear like, "Yeah, keep it simple," they're like, "Yeah, yeah, we're going to keep it simple." What are some things that point to, "This is not simple," that tell you like, "No, this is way too complicated. You should try to simplify this metric even though it's not ideal. It's not the perfect metric, but it needs to be simpler."

Jessica Lachs (00:50:56):
Yeah. So we had a score for merchant health, which we tried experimenting with, which was a combination of factors that we had found would lead to a merchant being on the platform and getting an order. So we wanted to make sure that the merchant had active hours on the platform and had images and had a full menu that was accurate and robust. A number of different inputs. And we created a composite that weighted all of these different inputs. And then we were like, "What is our merchant health score?" And you were like, "It's 0.35. It's not 35%. So what is that, that 0.35? I don't know what it is." So instead of that, we said, "What are the most important factors in order... First, let's measure how many of the new merchants are getting an order within their first, say, seven days on the platform.

(00:51:57):
And then let's look at how many of our merchants are doing these things we know are important. So these inputs. So let's goal our team on getting merchant photo coverage up. Let's goal the team on making sure that we have open hours, accurate hours." So yes, someone might say it's simpler to have a composite metric, but it was so hard to understand what it was and how to move it that it became meaningless. And ultimately moving to something that was simpler to understand, even if it meant having three metrics instead of one, it ultimately was better for the team because folks knew what they were trying to move. And so yeah, maybe we missed number four, five and six on the list of things, but you got one through three and that's 95% of it anyway. So once we get success with that 95, then let's talk about figuring out the other 5%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:55):
It's so funny because this is exactly what we went through at Airbnb, we had, we call that a healthy host. I led the host quality team for a while and we came up with this healthy host metric that was six factors of a host, like the cancellation rate, the review rate, their response rate and things like that. And then we're just like, "Cool, let's move this, let make more hosts healthy." And then you end up like, "Okay, which one do we focus on?," And, "Oh, what about all these others?" And we ended up basically focusing on one at a time. And so let's just make that the goal for now and then rotate through the different biggest [inaudible 00:53:28] opportunities to move. [inaudible 00:53:30].

Jessica Lachs (00:53:30):
Exactly. I think in hindsight for the example you give, which of those six things are actually the most important? And if you're able to then quantify which one matters most, you work on that one first and you materially move that one and then you work on the next one. You want to move them all. But being able to prioritize and know what you're going to get for a 20% improvement in, say, your cancellation rate, that's where analytics I think can add a lot of value. Because yes, ultimately you'll get to all of them, but the way you do that and the time can have a meaningful impact on your growth. If you can target the most problematic things first and solve those, you get more bang for your buck and that compounds over time. And so doing the things that matter first and most quickly is a competitive advantage in my opinion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:21):
The other thing we found along those same lines is rotating between different metrics is so not efficient because you get good at, "We're going to move this metric." And your team's like, "Cool, we totally understand this lever," like cancellation rate. We become really smart at cancellation rate and then three months later, you need to switch to response rate and they have to learn a whole new paradigm of how to think about it. And it's just super inefficient. So we found basically, just keep a team on the metric until there's no more opportunities and give another team one of these other metrics.

Jessica Lachs (00:54:50):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:52):
So many lessons. Okay. And the first thing you said on how to pick a good metric about this idea of short-term metrics that have long-term impact. How did you phrase that again?

Jessica Lachs (00:55:02):
Yeah, so we find proxy metrics for long-term outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):
Awesome. And it's similar to the simple metric, and it all comes down to, again, just like the metric should be something probably, you can move, you can understand, that's close enough to this ideal, perfect metric, but isn't necessarily the entire ideal. Okay, awesome. Anything else along these lines of just picking metrics, working with metrics that you've learned that would be worth [inaudible 00:55:28]?

Jessica Lachs (00:55:27):
With metrics, we are often looking at the average, and I think we talked about this a little bit earlier, but making sure that you're looking at the edge cases and your fail states is also really important. And so we often will set goals actually and create metrics around those edge cases. So like the disaster deliveries, the ones that go terribly wrong. So we have this concept of Never Delivered, which is orders that are never delivered. We're really great at naming things at DoorDash, and they're very rare. And so if you were just looking at the average effect or the average consumer experience, it would never come up. If you were just measuring quality based on average values of delivery times and lateness [inaudible 00:56:18], these wouldn't show up because they are so rare, but they're terrible. They're terrible experiences for consumers. They lead to churn.

(00:56:27):
They're incredibly expensive because you're refunding an order or repurchasing food and having to send another dasher to deliver that repurchased food. So they're very expensive, they're costly from a consumer experience standpoint. And I think if you're not looking for these fail states, they are often missed. So I think when you're picking metrics, yes, you want to improve engagement and you want to improve conversion, and there's a lot of things that are averages overall that you want to move, but it's so important to find these edge cases in these fail states and actually set concrete goals around eliminating them because it can be really powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):
So the tip here is actually make that a goal like, never deliver at some team, just keep cutting that down?

Jessica Lachs (00:57:17):
Exactly. So we have part of our quality analytics team and we have product engineering and ops on it as well. Their goal is to eradicate Never Delivered. And in order to do that, you have to understand why they happen. Sometimes it's human error, sometimes it's fraud. And then figure out ways that you can prevent them, that you can fix them while it's happening and ultimately just get rid of them from the system. And you're never going to completely get rid of them, but you can make a meaningful impact to make them even more rare than a fraction of a percent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:00):
Yeah. And I feel like people may be hearing this and like, "Of course, why would you not focus on terrible work experiences?" But I think in most companies, they look at the big numbers, they look at the averages as you said like, "Oh, it almost never happens. Why do we even spend any time on this?" And your point is, you should actually spend time on these really terrible experiences, even if it's a tiny portion of your business. I guess maybe share why that's important. Is it just because that has trickle-down effects on the brand?

Jessica Lachs (00:58:27):
Yeah, I think it's a couple of things. So just because something doesn't happen frequently doesn't mean that it's not important. So the Never Delivered example is a great one in that this is leading directly to churn and it's also costing a lot of money far more than its frequency would suggest. And I think the fact of the matter is is when you have things that cause churn, you're losing all of that consumer's subsequent orders, and that is not necessarily observed. You're just seeing one bad experience, you're not seeing all of the lost orders because they're lost. And so I think that sometimes this is an area where the data doesn't show you the full picture. And being able to quantify the impact on engagement, on profitability, will make it stand out as something that really, that you would maybe miss if you weren't really looking for it.

(00:59:25):
And then I think the other thing is with something like login errors, sometimes you don't see it in the data because people can't even get into the data. If you're not able to log in, you're not making any purchases, you're not ordering, and so you may not see it in the data that you're looking at. And so that's also something that I think is important for data folks to think about, which is what data don't we have? What data might we be missing? Where might there be opportunities and things that we actually need to identify and fix that we may not see? Because in this case, with login failures, they're not able to log in. They're not in the denominator, and so we're missing out on them from the data set entirely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):
Just a couple of more questions. There's one that I skipped that I'm just going to come back to. It's completely out of nowhere, but I think it might be interesting is about a global data org. So you run a global data org, you have data scientists and analysts and biz ops people all over the world, not just the US. I'm curious just how is it different managing data people in different countries versus just the US? What's a big difference?

Jessica Lachs (01:00:37):
Everyone always asks about the differences. What I am surprised by is how similar things are, how similar people are, the data scientists themselves, but also consumers and dashers and couriers, as we call them at Volt. There's a lot more similarities than differences. I do think that when you built a business in the US and then you introduce new countries, having different currencies and different languages adds complexity that you weren't necessarily familiar with. I think similarly in EU countries versus non-EU countries in Europe, there's different regulation. So that adds a fun layer of complexity. So I do think that it adds complexity to the problem set, but ultimately so many of the problems are the same. It feels a little bit like going into a test having seen the answer key. And so for me, there are problems we've encountered at Volt through Volt analytics where I'm like, "Oh, we've had a similar problem.

(01:01:49):
I have an instinct for what the answer might be. Let's still test because there could be differences cultural or otherwise, but I feel like I know where we're going to end." And then sometimes there are problems where it's new for one reason or another, and it's exciting because you're like, "All right, let's see if things are different here." Let's see what ideas might work in a Volt country that don't work in a DoorDash country and vice versa. So I think I tend to focus more on what's the same, and then I'm pleasantly surprised when I find things that are different because that keeps you on your toes and keeps things interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):
I'm going to take us to AI Corner. This is a segment we have in the podcast where I try to understand how people are using AI in their day-to-day and in their business. I'm curious if you've found some really interesting way of using AI ideally in... you can go in either one of these directions, and how you or your team work day-to-day using AI tools to make you more efficient, or integrating AI into your product, making DoorDash better.

Jessica Lachs (01:02:59):
Yeah, I think that there are opportunities in both. I think one of the things I'm really excited about is actually the former. So in helping to make the team more productive, we do something called Office Hours at DoorDash, the analytics team. And it's something that we started eight years ago, and it was a way to provide support for teams that at the time we just didn't have the bandwidth to support. So we would go, in the early days, we'd go sit in a room and we'd say, "Come on in and we'll help you with anything you need help with. We'll help teach you SQL. We'll help look at some of your work. We'll be a thought partner. You could just come learn what we're working on." Whatever it was. We would do two hours every week of Office Hours at different times to be friendly to different time zones.

(01:03:52):
And I think one of the things I'm excited about is being able to really empower some of the folks that are still coming to Office Hours for one thing or another to be able to use AI to help edit queries on their own for example, to be able to say, "Here's a query. I want to make this. Please adjust this to our grocery business so that I can see the GOV for grocery." And so working to build these tools that will help not just our team in terms of time saving, and also to be honest, folks are going to use it on our team, but really to be able to empower non-technical users to be able to do things on their own and not have to take up bandwidth for the analytics team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:40):
So essentially it's a chatbot that anyone in the company can talk to you to get advice on how to write SQL queries, query data and things like that?

Jessica Lachs (01:04:47):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
Is there a clever name for this chatbot per chance?

Jessica Lachs (01:04:51):
So it's not clever. It's called Ask Data AI, and that's named for our internal Slack channel that used to be the open Q&A for people to ask data. So it's not at all clever.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):
But it's clear.

Jessica Lachs (01:05:07):
But again, it goes with the theme of very, very specific naming conventions that we have at DoorDash; Never Delivered and Ask Data AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:18):
I love it. Just clarity above all else. That's something I've learned from an editor that I work with. Jess, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with? For folks that are trying to build their data teams, make their data teams more efficient, is there any final wisdom nugget you'd want to share?

Jessica Lachs (01:05:39):
I think the only thing that I want to reiterate is that you don't necessarily need a formal training in whatever it is you're building. And I think that also goes towards the folks that you hire onto the team. And so I mentioned earlier that we've had a lot of folks go to product or go to ops from the team. What I didn't mention is how many folks we've actually had join the analytics team from partner teams. So whether that was from engineering or from our ops team or marketing or finance, we are a net importer of talent as opposed to a net exporter of talent. And I think that that's because my own experience coming over from operations, from being a GM and making that transition into analytics, I find that I'm drawn to other folks who want to make a similar transition.

(01:06:39):
Now again, you have to have the technical skills, and most of these folks have acquired these skills on the job, whatever job they are doing at DoorDash before they transition to the analytics team, or they had maybe some formal training in school. But I love seeing the folks that make that transition and actually want to join the analytics team, even if they're not a career or data scientist. I think it creates a really unique environment where you have folks on the team from different backgrounds with different expertise who can teach each other things. So I can teach you how to build a discounted cash flow model in Excel, and I can learn how to make kick-ass slides from someone who has a background in consulting. And I can learn about common gotchas in statistics from someone who comes to us with a Master's or a PhD in statistics, and we've got our econometrics folks and we've got our economists. We just have a group of people with different backgrounds who can all teach each other how to be better. And we're not all carbon copies of each other.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):
What I'm hearing is you try to optimize almost for a lot of different complementary skills and very different backgrounds almost.

Jessica Lachs (01:08:02):
Exactly. And also people who have experience at different size companies. I think I love folks from startups who have that hustle and grit, but I also love folks who've seen what scale looks like and can help us see around corners as far as what problems we will encounter as the business is growing. And I think it is not just about a diversity of skill and a diversity of background, it's also diversity of prior company and stage. That can be really a unique way to think about structuring your team so that you get the best of both worlds.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:40):
Amazing. Well, just when you thought we were done, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Jessica Lachs (01:08:47):
I am. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:48):
Let's do it. Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jessica Lachs (01:08:55):
I tend to read fiction, particularly historical fiction, and I love spy novels. So I think my brain is always in problem-solving mode even when reading. A recent book that I read that I enjoyed was The Rose Code by Kate Quinn, and it's about women code breakers in World War II, and I really enjoyed that. But rather than recommending a book... I guess I did just recommend a book, but rather than recommending another book, I am going to recommend the Libby app and supporting your local public library because I love the library and I love Libby, so I'll give that as my other recommendation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:37):
Beautiful. Very on brand with sharing economy, company stuff. Libby. Cool. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jessica Lachs (01:09:46):
Yeah, another one. I don't actually watch a lot of TV, definitely don't watch a lot of movies. In fact, haven't seen some of the movie greats. I get yelled at a lot by my friend. "I can't believe you haven't seen that." I tend to re-watch things, so series from the past, over and over again. I think it's just like how I shut my brain off. So I've recently re-watched The West Wing, which is one of my favorite shows of all time, probably for the 50th time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:15):
Oh my God.

Jessica Lachs (01:10:16):
And Alias, which was a Jennifer Garner series from the early 2000s. Also, Spy. So I'm noticing a theme. I think I really love the spy genre. But yeah, I've watched those. They're both great, but not at all current.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:33):
Perfect. Perfectly acceptable. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?

Jessica Lachs (01:10:39):
This is a bit of a curveball. So Korean sunscreens. So I burn really easily, so I have to wear sunscreen and I love Korean sunscreens. I was introduced to them by a friend of mine, and they're just far superior to what we have in the US. So I highly recommend people give Korean sunscreens a try, particularly there's a Beauty of Joseon on branded sunscreen. It's just amazing and is delightful to wear, which is important when you have to wear it every day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:09):
I've been trying to wear more sunscreen as I age, and so this is a really good tip. Was that a brand you recommended?

Jessica Lachs (01:11:15):
Yeah. So Beauty of Joseon is the brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):
Beauty of Joseon.

Jessica Lachs (01:11:18):
There's another brand, Isntree, which also has a great sunscreen. But I'll be honest, almost every Korean sunscreen I've tried is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):
Okay. I'm Googling this as soon as we get off. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and share and or share with family and friends even more [inaudible 01:11:39]?

Jessica Lachs (01:11:40):
I do. So there's a John Steinbeck quote, which I'm not big on quotes, but I like this one, which is that, "It's a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it." I find that that's something I really live by. First off, I love sleep and I try to get as much of it as possible. But the other thing is that if I'm stuck on a problem or if I am writing a response to something like a tense issue or an emotional issue, often I find that if I put down my thoughts, go to sleep, check it in the morning, I end up with a better outcome. So all of a sudden you have a new perspective and clarity on a problem you were stuck on, or you realize that you weren't clear in the way you were communicating your thoughts because you were emotional about something and you're able to put together a much better response to an e-mail or to whatever problem you're handling. So sleep can solve lots of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:46):
I love sleep as well. I'm always telling my wife, "Let's go to sleep." Like, "Okay, I'll be there soon." I love that advice. Okay, two more questions. Who's influenced you most in your career? Is there someone that comes to mind?

Jessica Lachs (01:13:00):
So I think two answers, a multi-part answer. So I think first my career has been in male-dominated industries and I've worked with just some incredible women who've really influenced me. When I was a banker, there were two senior bankers, Vanessa Roberts and Gina Tarone at Lehman Brothers where I worked. And they were just so incredible. They were just so good at their jobs and I found that really inspiring.

(01:13:29):
And then at DoorDash, Tia Sherringham, who is our GC, and Liz Jarvis-Shean, who leads comms, are just dominant in their fields. And I think that that's really empowering and have been big influences on me to just see strong, powerful women kicking ass and that helps me believe that I can do the same. So that's one answer.

(01:13:54):
And then the other answer, sort of cliche, but my parents. My mom was a statistician at the UN before she got married, and she actually chose to stay home and raise three children, so I'm the youngest. And when I was in, I think it was elementary school, decided to go back to school, switch careers and become a nurse. And so the fact that she embarked on this completely new career in her forties after 15 years as a stay-at-home mom and my father supported this. I think that that was really, really influential and was probably the first time I saw that you can do whatever you put your mind to, no matter your age, no matter your circumstances. So that was really influential and I don't think I've ever told her that. So hi, Mom.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):
Hi Mom. Thank you, mom.

Jessica Lachs (01:14:45):
Yeah, I think that was influential for my career. Definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):
That's a beautiful answer. Fun fact, I worked with Liz at Airbnb. Your person you just mentioned in the comms team.

Jessica Lachs (01:14:57):
[inaudible 01:14:57]. She is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:58):
She's amazing. Final question. So when you joined DoorDash, imagine it wasn't obvious that it was going to work. I imagine it was still like, "This was a crazy idea. Maybe it'll work, maybe not." Is there a moment you recall where you're like, "I think this is going to be a big success? I think this is actually going to work out?"

Jessica Lachs (01:15:14):
To be honest, I went into DoorDash because I wanted to learn for the experience. I thought it was interesting, problems with interesting people. I never thought too much about whether it would work. I of course wanted it to work and was very competitive and wanted to win. I think there's two moments that stand out. One was when the third party market share data showed that we had become the number one player after, I think we started at number four or five. And I think that that was really exciting to see the trajectory and to see us gain in category share. That was exciting. I probably didn't see it until months after it had happened because we don't spend a ton of time focusing on it, but I do remember somebody wanted to include the graph in some presentation, some sales material, and we're like, "Oh, we're number one. That's incredible. We used to be number five." So I'd say that that was one.

(01:16:17):
The other one that stands out was, the first talk I gave in a lot of these startup talks in the early days in Boston, and I'd asked the audience, "How many of you have used DoorDash?" And there'd be like three people who would raise their hand. And then it was a few years ago, maybe 2018, 2019, and I was giving a talk and I asked the audience, "How many of you have used DoorDash?" And almost everyone's hands went up. And that was actually pretty memorable for me because in my mind, we were still the small startup that no one had heard of where I had to over enunciate the D's in DoorDash. So people didn't think I worked for Jordash, the nineties' denim company. And so that was pretty meaningful to me when just so many people had used the product or were consumers of DoorDash. It was pretty exciting. And I still get excited. I saw DoorDash mentioned in a book recently that I was reading. It was like, "We're in the book." So those little things when you become part of the cultural lingo that I think are really, really special.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:33):
Well, I'm a very happy customer of DoorDash. I've never had a Never Deliver. It's always there, sometimes a little late. Usually it's perfect. Thank you for everything you do. Go team DoorDash.

(01:17:44):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow stuff that you do? I know you've been doing more writing on LinkedIn and things like that, so just help people understand where to find you and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jessica Lachs (01:17:55):
Yeah, so as you mentioned, to find me LinkedIn, I don't have a huge social presence, but I am on LinkedIn and I am currently writing a series of blog posts about my experience building a global analytics org at DoorDash. Some of the lessons I've learned over the last 10 years. So definitely check those out.

(01:18:16):
And as far as your second question of how listeners can be useful to me, I guess read the post on LinkedIn and I'd love to hear what people think, whether you agree with my point of view or not. That being said, be nice. I want honest feedback, but I want kindness as well. So yeah, just engage with the content and let me know what y'all think. I think I do have a broader ask, which is just to encourage folks listening to TruthSeek, something I take seriously at DoorDash. It's a company value. But there's a lot of misinformation out there and it's often up to us as individuals to figure out what's fact and what's fiction. So I have a plea for folks to do your best, to search for the truth and speak the truth, and I think we'll all be better off for it. And of course, use DoorDash.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:13):
Of course.

Jessica Lachs (01:19:14):
Yes, there are three things that listeners can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):
You're at DoorDash.com. That was awesome. I love that last point as well in addition, to use DoorDash. Jessica, thank you so much for being here.

Jessica Lachs (01:19:27):
Thank you for having me. It was a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):
Same for me. Bye, everyone.

# Building minimum lovable products, stories from WeWork & Airbnb, and thriving as a PM | Jiaona Zhang

## Transcript

Jiaona Zhang (00:00:00):
I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. You could be known for shepherding like the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking. Working with go-to--market teams and cross-functional stakeholders that could be like your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems, find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.

Lenny (00:00:43):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is JZ. JZ is senior vice president of product at Webflow. She's also a lecture at Stanford, teaching a course on product management. Before this, she was senior director of product management at WeWork, a longtime product leader at Airbnb, where I got to work with JZ for a number of years and she's also PM at Dropbox and at a gaming company called Pocket Gems.

(00:01:12):
In her conversation, we dig into the most common mistakes early product managers make in their career. Plus JZ's biggest product mistake. We cover the concept of minimal lovable products versus minimal viable products. We talk about JZ's unique frameworks for road mapping and prioritization and OKRs and her take on how to structure your first 90 days as a product leader at a new company, plus what she's learned from her wild year at WeWork. Also, the best advice she's ever gotten around product and leadership and the story of Airbnb Plus and where it went wrong.

(00:01:43):
I've been hoping to get JZ on the podcast for a while and I'm really happy that we finally made this happen. With that, I bring you JZ after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:53):
Today's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you are using the same datasets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high quality data from real humans and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.

(00:02:35):
If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to be become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.

(00:03:10):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one-pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people publish in the Miro verse.

(00:03:45):
When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works. Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. Actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:04:22):
JZ, welcome to the podcast.

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:24):
Thanks for having me. I'm so excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:26):
It's 100% my pleasure. Amongst your many accomplishments, you teach product management at Stanford, which sounds very fancy. How long have you been doing this at this point?

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:37):
I think six years. Yeah.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Okay. So my question, the real question I want to ask about this is, in that time you've seen a lot of new PMs and you've seen these PMs succeed, you've seen some fail. What are the most common mistakes that you find new PMs make in this experience of helping new PMs get into the field?

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:56):
I think something that is really hard to untrain, but I think every human does it, is you jump to solutions. And so one of the biggest things I see, not just in my course but also just as a PM and some of the mistakes that you make as a PM is the idea of you get really attached to a solution, a way of implementing something that you can see in your head that you want to build.

(00:05:16):
And so that's the first thing I really want to unteach in our course. And so a lot of people will literally come in, they'll be like, "I want to build X startup" or "I want to do this thing," or "I'm in blank school and I've been doing a lot of research on this particular area." And so untraining that and being like, "Hey, we're going to go out there. We are not going to think at all about the thing that you want to build, but instead we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, 'Hey, you want to build X thing for Y person.'" So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around.

Lenny (00:05:55):
Does a lot of this come from people want to get into product management because they think "Finally I'll have the power, finally I'll be able to tell people what to build, finally my ideas really going to matter?" Is that where a lot lobby comes from?

Jiaona Zhang (00:06:06):
I think there's a part of that. One of the first things I teach is you're not a CEO, you're, you're not here... You actually have very little true authority because you don't actually manage anyone. A lot of it is all through influence, and so that is also a piece where you have to kind of untrain that thinking. I do think a lot of people come into the product role thinking that I get to call the shots, I get to make the decisions, I get to decide what gets built. And really your job is not that. Your job is to understand here are the opportunities, and then you're kind of pulling together all the different possibilities and you're really editing. So I do think it comes from desire for a lot of people thinking that's what the product role is when it actually isn't.

Lenny (00:06:44):
So let's go to the other side of this question. We talked about what mistakes new PMs make. I'm curious, what's the biggest product mistake that you've made?

Jiaona Zhang (00:06:53):
Wow, that's a good one. It's so interesting. I feel like as product people, we're always making mistakes and we're always learning. Maybe I'll give an example from Airbnb since you and I were both there. And this one does stand out to me, we were working on this concept called Airbnb Plus. If you took a step back, what we were really trying to do is to be like, "Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of... It's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?" But I do think we were very solution-first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Sonders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like "[inaudible 00:07:36] what are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?"

(00:07:38):
And so we went really hard down the solution space. We essentially were like, "Let's go inspect our inventory, let's actually try to manage our inventory more." And really what we should have done is taken a step back and be like, "What's the real problem? The real problem is people want to know what they're getting themselves into. We need to represent the homes a lot better." And I think the other piece here that's really important is, what, as a company is your strategic strength and what's in your wheelhouse? So for example, Airbnb, we weren't that strong in operations. Again, we're this platform with this marketplace. And so if you don't have that muscle and then you're asking the company, the teams to essentially build it from the ground up, that's really, really difficult. Not to mention the unit economics, are the unit economics actually going to work even as you scale?

Lenny (00:08:22):
Yeah, I feel like Airbnb Plus is an untold story that somebody should tell and that could be its own podcast, I guess.

Jiaona Zhang (00:08:28):
You and I can tell it.

Lenny (00:08:30):
We could tell this could be Airbnb Plus The Hidden Story. As you said, the problem it was trying to solve was people don't really trust... They don't want to even consider Airbnb because it's like, "No, I don't want to stay in someone's home. I don't know what it'll be. It's unpredictable." And so as an outsider, it felt like a really clever approach. "We're going to vet them, we're going to make sure they're awesome. There's a minimum bar." And I guess this is the question is do you think it was just like "This is never possible because we'll never make money as a business doing this because we don't make that much per booking and investing time, resources, sending people pillows, all that stuff is ever going to be economical"? Or do you think there was a path that was just not executed well?

Jiaona Zhang (00:09:10):
I think there wasn't really a clear path. I think there was less of-

Lenny (00:09:10):
Yeah, that's my impression.

Jiaona Zhang (00:09:15):
Exactly. And it was more just like if you understood... Again, this is what my point around unit economics, there are things where I think you have magical thinking around unit economics. You're like, "When we get to the scale of X, it's all going to work out. We can make these things happen." I think you actually need to really make sure that unit economics work quite at the beginning. That is definitely one lesson. And I think the other thing is, and going back to spirit of what are you trying to achieve. If you're trying to achieve this idea of really knowing the quality of the place, and for a platform like Airbnb, the right way to go about doing is through our reviews, through our guest reviews, which are essentially free as opposed to literally sending out inspectors.

(00:09:51):
And I think that the other things are if you can get signal on what are the things around quality that people care about, is it cleaning? Is it, "Hey, I'm locked out"? And I think that there are other solutions besides inspection that then get at that. So for example, it is actually cheaper to go send everyone a lockbox than to deploy an inspector and go look at your property. It is actually cheaper to maybe do a partnership with a bunch of cleaners in different local areas and then get that as part of the fee, as opposed to doing the inspection. So again, it's really about what are you really trying to achieve? What is the user problem in each of these areas and can you target that problem with the particular listing that you're looking at?

(00:10:33):
And so I personally don't believe the unit economics ever would've really worked out. I think we should have known that or we should have dug into that more at the very beginning and then to get very tailored instead of one blunt instrument to solve it all, "Hey, we're going to go inspect." It's like what is the problem for this listing and what's the best solution to fix that problem?

Lenny (00:10:51):
There's a couple things that I think are important product leadership lessons here. One is Airbnb and Brian and many great leaders are famous for imagining the ideal situation, imagining the great end result and then working backwards. And often that leads to great results when you're being really ambitious and "I don't know how we're going to get there, we're just going to shoot big and hopefully we figure it out." Sometimes it works out. In this case it didn't work out. And what you're finding, maybe you even knew this early on, is just like there's no possible world where this could have worked in this approach. Is there anything you've learned about just when to think big and not even like "Forget it. We're going to figure it out. I know this seems impossible, but we're just going to try it anyway"? Do you have any kind of framework of when to think big, then just go for it? Versus, "Oh, let's just work out the math today," is this ever possible?

Jiaona Zhang (00:11:42):
I think it's really important for every company to be dreaming big. If you don't have a big vision, it's really hard for you to innovate, but you got to couple that really big vision with thoughtfulness around your execution. And so I think that one of the biggest tips I have is how do to be clear about the phase that you're in? So I think it's totally fine to be like, "Hey, we are going to try X for six months, three months, whatever it is, and we're explicitly going to go learn these types of things. We're going to learn why are people? Are there signals that we would that would indicate that again, the communication with host isn't great or this type of listing, if it's hosted by a person with multiple property?" I think there are factors we can be like, "Hey, we can learn this very explicit thing in a given period of time."

(00:12:32):
And you can do what I call unscalable things in that prototyping phase, in that early phase to go learn those lessons. But you just have to be very, very clear with your team on what phase you're in. "Hey, we're in the learning phase and we explicitly are trying to learn these things" versus, "Hey, we have this really big vision and we're just going to go at it." That is not recommended in my mind. It's breaking it down into these smaller chunks. That I think gets you the balance of thinking really, really big, but also being able to be like, "Okay, we are still going to be able to say, 'Okay, this path is not going to work out. We ran at it for a short period of time. We got these learnings, now let's go down this other path.'"

Lenny (00:13:11):
Yeah, there's also some cost fallacy that kicks in of just like, "Oh, I spend so much time and money and resources on this thing. Let's just go a little bit longer. Let's just see if we give it another quarter, maybe it'll work out."

Jiaona Zhang (00:13:21):
You should articulate what success looks like and the milestones you want to hit in the small intervals that I talked about. So you don't get into this world where you're like, "Hey, I've gone for two years investing in this thing. Now we got to cut it." It's like, what is the quarter long milestone? Okay, what's the next quarter long milestone? And every single point, what is a go and no-go? And I think that really can help a team and a company say "It's okay. I invested a quarter in it, but I didn't invest two years."

Lenny (00:13:46):
The other important lesson here is about the importance of as a product leader pushing back and convincing leadership that you are wrong and this shouldn't happen. I remember talking to one of our colleagues, Mike Lewis, who was leading a different team with Airbnb, and he was just like, "Oh, I realized I'm the person that should be saying, 'No, we shouldn't do this now'" because he was the head of product for one of the new [inaudible 00:14:09]. And I know maybe in that situation it was impossible because Brian was very into this and everyone was like, "We need to do this thing."

(00:14:18):
I guess is there anything you've learned about how to push back on these sorts of things that the founder's really into when it makes sense to go along? Like "Cool, let's do it. Let's buy in." As a leader, you have to be excited and he needs to feel like, "Oh, JZ is really excited about this too. We got to try it." Even though maybe you feel like it's not going to work out. So I guess the question is when do you think it makes sense to try convince the founder, "No, this is the bad idea" versus like "Let's go for it"?

Jiaona Zhang (00:14:42):
I think first it comes down to your conviction. Do you actually have conviction that this is a bad idea or are you personally still learning? Right. I think if you're at the point, if you're like, "I have total conviction," then your job is to say, no, you really... If you do not, you're not doing your job. And then the question is what are the tips in how to convince someone who's very bought into an idea that that's not the right idea? And there what I would say is it's understanding the spirit of what they're trying to achieve. Being able to go back with, "Hey, I understand the spirit. The spirit is that we're trying to get people who previously didn't consider Airbnb before to come and use Airbnb, but the right way to do it is not this very time-intensive, cost-intensive way to inspect all these homes. The way to do it is to be much more granular in what we ask people when they upload their home and more checks in that. And that could be automated and through technology as opposed to through humans."

(00:15:37):
It's coming back with actual options. It's like saying... And I think we did that a little bit to be honest, when we as a team evolve, we learn and we're like, "This isn't going to work." And I explicitly moved off the team and I was like, "I'm going to work on the review system. I'm going to continue to evolve this and make it better because that is the actual scalable way to do this as opposed to keep going at it in the very manual process."

(00:15:59):
And so I think that the biggest tip I would have for people in this situation is really understand whether it's the founder or your manager or whoever it is, what is it that they're trying to accomplish for the user and for the business? Remind them of that, get aligned on that. And then come back with better options. A lot of these people, they're very smart and they're very motivated. They ultimately want to just do the right thing for their users. When you come back with a much better solution and you have the data and you have the thinking behind it's very rare that someone will be like, "I still want to go after this solution despite the fact that it's not working and you proposed a much better path forward."

Lenny (00:16:37):
And I think to touch on what you've already said is also make sure it's actually... There's a world where this could work. Do some math to figure out if this is a business that will actually make some money in the future.

Jiaona Zhang (00:16:49):
Totally.

Lenny (00:16:50):
Okay. I'm going to bounce around a little bit. I have a bunch of different questions around different topics. You popularized this concept of minimal lovable product versus this idea that everyone always comes back to, which is minimal viable product. Can you just talk about what is a minimal lovable product and then when does it make sense to go in that direction versus a traditional MVP?

Jiaona Zhang (00:17:10):
The reason I care so much about minimal lovable product is because I do think in a world where there are so many different options, it's hard to just feel like, "Hey, use this thing. It barely meets a quality bar." And so I think this idea of actually deeply understanding for the thing that you're working on, what is a lovable experience? What is the quality bar that resonates with your users? And again, especially in a world where there might be a lot of different options. Minimal lovable products is the new MVP. The new minimal viable product.

(00:17:40):
So I think that's the real point, but at the end of the day, it does come back to what are the options that a user has and what are they trying to do? So there's a world where your quality bar, your "Quality bar," or let's call it your polished bar, can be a little bit lower because the reality is the thing that you're "Competing against" or you're replacing is literally a manual workflow. It's like spreadsheets. It's doing something in a super terrible way.

(00:18:05):
So you want to get your product to market as quickly as possible, so it doesn't make sense for you to be like, "I'm going to build these 15 additional features." Because compared to what people are doing right now, your product without those 15 additional features is perfectly fine, perfectly usable, and perfectly quite honestly lovable. So it requires a lot of understanding of, again, your users and the space that you play in and the tolerance of your given user. So for example, a designer might have a lot higher of a bar of like "This is the kind of workflow I want, this is the kind of bar for my product." But again, someone sitting on the finance team or the IT team, their bar might be like, "Oh, I'm used to doing these 15 things and so your thing is just a lot better."

Lenny (00:18:53):
I'd love to go even one level deeper. Is there an example of something you've worked on that was minimal lovable product that you think about? Or is there something out there that's an example of here's maybe an example of a minimal lovable product versus MVP?

Jiaona Zhang (00:19:08):
Again, it's very hard. I think every product team, every product person struggles with this idea of what is the minimal viable. Even that concept itself is difficult and not to mention minimal lovable. I'll give a Webflow example. Very recently, so have been investing in a couple of new features, memberships and logic, new functionality for our users. And what we realized at the end of the day after investing in these areas, we were like, "Hey, we can get to minimal viable, but we don't know if we can actually get to minimal lovable in a way that our users really, really want. And so does it make sense for us to continue to go down this path of continues to chip away to get to minimal lovable when we are maybe hitting diminishing returns for our user base? Or does it actually make sense to release what we have but then encourage our ecosystem to contribute the lovable piece?"

(00:19:56):
And again, it's not just like you put it out there and you hope, you have to have a very strong point of view of are we at minimal viable, are we at minimal lovable? Where in between are we? And so having that point of view and then being able to say, "Are we going to be able to meet it as a company? Are we going to rely on our ecosystem to help us meet it? What are we actually going to do?" And then even within the feature set, it's very much a how do we do some things well as opposed to do a little bit of everything? I think that is a big piece of minimal lovable, which is again... To me it's better to do five things instead of the 15 things in a really, really great way with a high degree of polish with a, "Oh, this really meets my need," versus trying to do everything and just doing a little bit of everything. And so every part of the experience feels a little bit clunky. It's not quite there.

(00:20:45):
People I think would actually respect this idea of "You've given me minimal lovable in five areas as opposed to minimal viable in 15 areas."

Lenny (00:20:53):
Is there anything you've seen of just that makes something lovable? I don't know. I know it's not easy to define, but what are things you've seen that makes something lovable? Is it delightful features? Or is it what you're saying, which is just things are actually good, there's fewer things, but they're each really good?

Jiaona Zhang (00:21:08):
There's definitely this idea of the thing is just good. It has all. High quality, it's not janky, it doesn't feel weird. I'll give you a very small example again, just from Webflow, this idea of keyboard shortcuts, feels small, but that is a piece that creates a lot of love from user base who are power users. And then there's this concept of pixie dusts, and maybe I'll pull out of call it like design tool space and we'll talk about some of the other things, whether it's Dropbox or Airbnb, but you can just do a little bit of that extra pixie dusts. So an example from Airbnb when we're doing the mobile app revamp where like "There's like these basic table stakes, but if we actually added in templates and we made it so that these templates could be maybe pre-populated in certain ways from the content they already have," that is lovable, that is that extra little bit of pixie dust and spending the time to do that.

(00:21:55):
Again, you can't pixie dust everything. At the end of the day, you basically have your time, your staffing and the scope of your project and something has to give. And so at the end of the day, you can't just keep investing, keep investing because it's going to push out your launch timeline, but can you pick a few different areas where you're like, "I'm going to scatter that pixie dust, I'm going to do a little bit more than what users are expecting"? And that creates that lovability.

Lenny (00:22:20):
Shifting to a different topic, I know you have strong opinions about road mapping and OKRs, improvisation, and I know that's a big topic, but let me just ask, what's the most common advice you give around how to roadmap well, do OKRs, prioritize and/or just, I don't know, common mantras or things you always come back to be successful in these areas?

Jiaona Zhang (00:22:40):
Road mapping prioritization are one bucket for me. And then OKRs is another. So I'll maybe give you my biggest tip in each one of these buckets.

(00:22:46):
So for road mapping, my biggest thing that I tell my teams is "You're telling a story. So what I want from you is I want themes, I want a story. Why are these things the biggest things to invest in these levers, the biggest ones to pull?" And what I really don't want, what I think is a very common mistake from road mapping is people thinking a spreadsheet with a bunch of projects, the RICE framework, everything has an impact, a cost and an effort column filled out. They think that is prioritization and that is a roadmap. If you just do that right and then you present that to your team, they're off to the races.

(00:23:26):
But what people, what humans really crave is like, "Why am I doing this body of work?" And I think it's also really, really important to have that really crisply articulated in your own head because ultimately what happens is you'll learn things as a product person. You'll be like, "Oh, I assumed this in the narrative in my head about my users or about my product area, and then I learned why and therefore my thinking changed." So instead of it being this massive spreadsheet where you're going in, you're tweaking all the values, what is the story that you're telling about your roadmap that these inputs can then go and influence?

(00:23:59):
It could be like, "Hey, I just realized I didn't know before that we have a lot more power users on our," or "Maybe we have a lot more non-technical users." That input changes my roadmap and changes my themes in a pretty dramatic way. So skating at that level is really, really critical, I think for a roadmap as opposed to going down to the really granular details of the how. So that's the biggest thing on road mapping, which is like tell a story. What are your themes? Make it so that your team can come up with the actual how and the projects and all the little details, but really create that scaffolding for them to know what's important.

Lenny (00:24:33):
Can I ask a follow-up question on that?

Jiaona Zhang (00:24:35):
Totally, yeah.

Lenny (00:24:36):
It's easy to visualize the roadmap of a spreadsheet to help people visualize what you're suggesting there. What does that actual artifact look like? Is it a doc with maybe an ancillary spreadsheet of the actual prioritization? Is it a deck? How do you actually deliver this to you with like "JZ, here's our proposal for our team"?

Jiaona Zhang (00:24:55):
Yeah, I'm a big fan of docs and decks are obviously helpful if you're talking live, but I do think in a remote-first culture or lots of us are in hybrid remote cultures it's hard because decks typically require a voiceover. And so we have been doing a big push even on my teams where I'm like, "Write it down and document. Force yourself to write the pros because when you write the pros, you can actually add that level of granularity." So very much so the same way like "I'm a roadmap is a story. You're telling themes, you write a story in a notebook, you write a story on pages," and so a doc is definitely preferred. And even in the doc just being like, "Here's what we're trying to achieve, here are the big areas I want to invest in, here are my big themes." And then going into each of those themes and being like, "These are the big projects."

(00:25:40):
And then linking out, again, not even to a spreadsheet, but linking out to the artifacts and the systems that your team actually uses. So if your team uses Jira, go ahead and link out to Jira because so often docs get out of... Or spreadsheets get out of date, because they're like a snapshot of whatever it is that you needed at that point in time. But instead you link out to the actual things that your teams are working out of, you can always be like, "These are the themes. I will edit these if I learn major things that would change my themes. And then let's go link out to the Jira where you can just see the snapshot of the roadmap at any given point in time."

Lenny (00:26:12):
Do you have a template or common structure you suggest to teams for laying out this story or is it just depends on the quarter, it depends on the year?

Jiaona Zhang (00:26:21):
I'll give a plug for a new thing coming out of Reforge, which is this concept of artifacts. And so we do have a lot of artifacts out there, so what's our general product development process? What are our templates for our specs? What are our templates for some of these things that we're talking about, a roadmap, like a broader roadmap instead of just a feature spec. So yes, we have a ton of those artifacts, are always evolving. I think every team takes it and tweaks it a little bit, but I'm a big believer of bringing those artifacts back and then sharing them across the team. And so product operations is also a function that we've invested in because it just really greases the wheels, gets all of our teams speaking the same language.

Lenny (00:26:57):
Awesome.

(00:28:02):
Moving to a different topic, what is your number one piece of advice to new PMs who want to accelerate their career? What do you find most often is the blocker or thing holding them back or something they can change that'll accelerate things?

Jiaona Zhang (00:28:18):
There's so many parts to it, but I'll pick one. And there are many frameworks even beyond the one, but let's pick one for your question, which is I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. And what I mean by that is when you're known in your company for a particular thing.... I'll give you a couple examples. You could be known for shepherding the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking, working with go-to market teams and cross-functional stakeholders, that could be your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems. You could be known for working on things that are really regulatory complex. Find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get. Because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.

Lenny (00:29:16):
Is there something you were known to be excellent at in the course of your career?

Jiaona Zhang (00:29:20):
I would say early on in my career, it was actually the fact that I had a strong analytics background. And so when I joined gaming, I came from consulting, I didn't have any CS background or design background, and so it was really creating a reputation around being very analytical, around being able to analyze the datasets of my game and then make decisions. I also learned as I was doing that I was actually really good at execution, and so being able to keep a lot of plates spinning and working on the largest studio and managing all the complex pieces of that, that was what I discovered. I didn't know this, but I discovered as I started working in the role.

(00:29:58):
And so that was something I brought to Dropbox. When I joined Dropbox. It was like I knew that I could work with a lot of different teams and make sure that we hit a launch deadline, and so I would find myself trying to lean into that superpower and then when delivering upon that, getting more responsibility, "Hey, you just launched this really complex thing, this was a project that had to work across a lot of different platforms. We're using Griddle APIs." And it was a very, very small team and it had a very, very tight deadline.

(00:30:29):
So when you're like, "I can do something like this," you end up getting more responsibility because people were like, "Oh, she was able to do something that was really hard with a small team," and so that's how you get more responsibility. But it has evolved in my career. I think that at the beginning of your career, you do want to lean into some of these pieces. It makes sense, but also even when you start to manage, it shifts dramatically. Being known as the best executor is not necessarily the thing that gives you and your team the most responsibility. So as I've grown my career, whether it's at Airbnb or WeWork or other places I flex into maybe a different... It's like taking your core strength but then flexing it and finding different ways to bring it to life.

Lenny (00:31:09):
Much of what I just heard is you just worked incredibly hard and just got shit done. And I think that's very, very important and often leads to a lot of success.

Jiaona Zhang (00:31:20):
PMs have to get shit done. Yeah, ultimately you're responsible for the outcome just no matter what happens.

Lenny (00:31:26):
Yeah. I like that. Be known for getting shit done and working really hard, and that's never going to serve you badly. I think that is just lasting advice for being successful as a PM. I realized that we were talking about your tips on prioritization, road mapping and then OKRs, and then I shifted topics and you never got to the OKR bucket. So let me come back to that.

Jiaona Zhang (00:31:47):
Yes. My biggest tip on OKRs is actually get really, really crisp on qualitatively. What would make you say "Yes, we did a great job"? And the reason I pushed so hard on that is because I see so many teams get really mucked down by OKRs. They're like, "Oh man, if I don't hit my OKR, I feel like I'm going to have a really bad reputation, or maybe I won't get promoted." You just get all this fear around OKRs. And so you see people, you see people sandbagging, you see people being hesitant to put in numbers until the very last second until they're super, super confident. And that results in ultimately a failure for your company to innovate and move quickly.

(00:32:29):
And so what I really push on for OKRs is are you actually... What's the spirit... I think I asked this question maybe too much to my team, but what is the spirit of what you're trying to achieve and what would make you say, 'I really, really crushed it this past quarter'? And so it's less about I would rather have all the OKRs be red or yellow and we missed everything and we learned around why we missed it than everything to be green. In fact, when everything's green, you're like, "We definitely did not set ambitious enough OKRs." And so it really pushed a lot on what does it truly mean to crush it and be successful? What does it mean for our users? What does it mean for our business? What does that... For our users to feel X, can you describe that? Can you write that out? For our business to see this in terms of the revenue growth?

(00:33:17):
And I think it's really hard because a lot of times, you get your data scientists, you get the PM themselves being like, "Oh man, I'm owning an input metric, not an output metric. And so I definitely can't sign up for that revenue target because I have an input metric." And all of those things are true, but if you don't do the homework of really drawing that line of being like, "This is the ultimate thing I want to do for the company and for my users," then a lot of times you end up hitting all your OKRs, but the company and your users at large are like, "I don't feel anything different." Your company doesn't look at the things that you've worked on and they don't say like "This is a smashing success." Your users are feeling no differently. And so that is the worst outcome in my head where your OKRs, you're almost like doing OKRs for the sake of OKRs, as opposed to letting them be a guide to delivering really great product to your end customer.

Lenny (00:34:09):
I like the idea of that, but imagine what often happens is you sign up for an ambitious OKR, you don't wait till the last second to commit to it and then ends up being red, and then you go into performance reviews and like, "Oh, Lenny didn't hit his OKRs. Look at this guy. His team is not doing great." How do you think about that as a product leader understanding if the team actually did well and the PM is performing well when they sign up for these really ambitious OKRs and their story's great and they're doing the right thing, but they fail?

Jiaona Zhang (00:34:37):
First of all, I think it's creating a culture where you are not punished for that. Because I definitely don't want a culture where it's like you took a risk and you failed and therefore your performance is impacted. I'd much rather people take risks than to be safe. So I think that's the first thing. That being said, you're also not doing a good job as a PM if you're like, "This is my super, super ambitious thing," and you're like, "I have no idea how to achieve it." Your job is to dream big and also have a plan to go tackle it. And so what I would expect the PM to be able to say is, "This is my North Star. I'm not going to be able to do that in a quarter, that just is unreasonable, but here are the five milestones," whatever number, some number of milestones "That it's going to take me to do quarter over quarter to achieve this really, really ambitious thing. And let me draw you that path. Here's the milestone all the way across, and this is the first one. This is why it's so meaningful."

(00:35:24):
So I expect that combination where you're like, "I know where I'm going. It's really, really ambitious." And then you can then break it down. But again, I would much rather have someone shoot for the moon, even for someone to say like "This is the thing I really want to do. I don't know my path yet" than to be really, really safe. Because when you're safe, you're always going to be building something suboptimal. It's going to be suboptimal use of your resources as opposed to actually trying to figure out what the best swing that you can take is.

Lenny (00:35:50):
So it sounds like it comes back to the story of the roadmap and what they're trying to accomplish, and just as long as it feels like the story made sense, there's a path there. The team did their best, I think we know it was really ambitious. We kind of knew maybe they wouldn't get there. It sounds like that's kind of the thing you look for in a performance of the PM.

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:07):
Totally. Yeah.

Lenny (00:36:10):
Awesome. I mentioned WeWork and I want to spend a little time on WeWork. You were at WeWork for about a year, and I think it was in the middle of a lot of the craziness that went on at WeWork.

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:18):
It was. It was 2019, I feel like that year it was either headlines were either about Trump or about WeWork in the news.

Lenny (00:36:26):
That's tough. So what was that like being a PM leader at a company in that craziness? And is there a takeaway from that experience that helps you be a better product manager, a leader, person?

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:37):
Yeah, I learned a lot from my time there. I think the most important lesson I learned was really around... I think there's like a people leader management lesson, and then there's also just like a how do you build an org period. The people lesson I learned was just really around empathy. In fact, essentially what I was doing was I built a team. I spent the first six months of my time there actually growing my team a lot, and not just in the US but in Asia and in Europe. And then the second half of my time there was actually being like, "What do we do? If this is what's happening with WeWork, what are we actually going to do with all of these people who have come to WeWork to work?"

(00:37:19):
And there was so many lessons there around leadership, around how do you think about people? How do you think about giving them the right transition plans? It was a lot of learning. And I think probably a lot of people, even right now through the macroeconomic downturn, they're learning that lesson in a really hard way. And so it was definitely something that I got a crash course on, I think early.

(00:37:44):
And the second lesson really was around not over-hiring. And so I think that was huge, and I think I personally learned that lesson through my time there. And it's something that I'm very conscious of at any company that I go to. Just because laying off half your team is a terrible feeling. Literally having hired people and then having to let them go, it's not something you want to do. And so being really thoughtful around how do we not over-hire? How are we really clear about, again, these milestones of we got to get through these gates, we got to be able to show these types of results, and then we unlock hiring in X, Y, Z ways? That hygiene is really, really important.

Lenny (00:38:22):
Feels like this connects back to the Airbnb Plus story of "Let's just be really ambitious. We don't have any idea how we're going to get there, but we're just going to go for it, hire like crazy, scale, put a lot of investment in this thing and hopefully we'll figure it out."

Jiaona Zhang (00:38:34):
I do think there was a little bit of that in the ethos of how WeWork was functioning, for sure. I think that what was really important for us to do was to be like, "We have this." Operationally, WeWork is really strong. In fact, I went to WeWork because having been at Airbnb, I was like, "I don't feel like we've dialed this operational muscle down," but I know from what I've seen and the way WeWork has expanded, that they're really, really excellent at the operations. But I think it was, again, we hired beyond our skis on the tech side. It's like we don't need a team of this size to go do the things that are needed for the product to feel really great. At the end of the day, it's about booking. And yes, there's technology that would accelerate that, but do we need it to be super platform aware? Do we need it to be super futuristic? That's actually not what people care about.

(00:39:19):
So this all goes back to what are people's core desires in whatever product that they're using, whatever thing that your business is trying to serve them? And so really understanding that will help you have a sense of, "Hey, you can still be really ambitious." Again, in a hybrid world, it's like why have real dedicated office space? Every company could go through WeWork as opposed to this dedicated space. That's still a really good idea, that's still a really big vision and a relevant vision, but what's the key piece of that vision? The key piece of that vision is around inventory, and then you make that inventory management easier. You make all of these things easier, but that's not a technology play in the same way as it is an operational play. So just really understanding, again, you can still dream really big, but you don't have to dream big and hire big in all the things in order to have a very ambitious vision that you deliver to the market.

Lenny (00:40:13):
If you think back to WeWork, what was your favorite memory and what was your hardest, least happy memory if anything comes to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (00:40:23):
I think this idea dream really big. I think everyone who had joined WeWork, they were like, "We could do a lot here." The idea of really the physical space infusing technology. I just feel like the people at WeWork were dreamers in the best possible way. So that definitely... I feel like for every company that I've been at, it's really about, you join... I personally joined for the product, but I stayed for the people you joined because you're like, "I want to work on this mission. This product is really motivating." And then you really stay for the people. And the people at We WeWork were really great. So that was definitely my favorite memory.

(00:40:58):
I think the hardest memory was, this gets a little bit personal, but I was actually in my first trimester when we were going through all of these layoffs and I basically was faced with a choice. It was like, "Hey, do I stay at WeWork? I would be guaranteed maternity leave." I was going to be moved onto this other team that was definitely going to stay. "Do I do that or do I actually..." And I think there just a last piece of... The thing I was wrestling with is I hired a lot of these people and I felt really responsible for the fact that I convinced them to come to this company that now was going through a lot of change.

(00:41:33):
And I specifically remember someone when I hired them, we had a long conversation about their visa and in my head I was like, "I just don't feel right. Again, laying someone off. That's only going to have so many days to be able to go find their new role." And so the hardest moment, I actually remember this very vividly, "Am I going to take this new role or am I going to put myself on a layoff list essentially and give the role to someone else on the team?" When I really think about it, yes, I was pregnant, but I would have more time and more freedom to go find my next thing versus someone who I brought to the company who was on a visa.

(00:42:09):
That to me just really stood out and goes back to this concept around leadership is so much about empathy and people as much as it's about understanding your market, your customers, and the strategy of your product.

Lenny (00:42:24):
Damn. What convinced you eventually to take off and try something different?

Jiaona Zhang (00:42:31):
I made the call of, in that particular case, I'd give the role to someone else. And then once I made that call, I was like, "I got to go find something. I know that this is my last day, so I have to go find something." And it was really interesting because I actually... I went through an interview process. I was in my second trimester and then ultimately I chose to join Webflow and I joined when I was literally at the beginning of my third trimester. So I had exactly 90 days before my first son was born.

Lenny (00:43:01):
That's a great segue to the question I was going to ask is around your 90-day plan that I know you put a lot of thought into how to think about the first 90 days, but before we get there, the movie on WeWork with Jared Leto, how similar to reality was that brought?

Jiaona Zhang (00:43:16):
I actually have not watched it. Parent life, you don't have any time. And I do think there's... I feel like if you ask people at Uber, if they've watched some of the [inaudible 00:43:26] they're like, "It's not for me." Same way why I haven't watched Silicon Valley. You're like, "It's a little too close to home."

Lenny (00:43:35):
It was quite a great movie and I really enjoyed it. I'm curious how close it was to real life. Okay, so then back to the 90-day questions. So I know you spent a lot of time thinking about your first 90 days at Webflow, you're pregnant as you described, and you have a perspective on just how to think about the first 90 days when you join a company. Can you just share what you've learned there, what you recommend there?

Jiaona Zhang (00:43:55):
Yeah, I do think the first 90 days, depending on your role is very different. But maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the first 90 days as a head of product. Because you're like, "Whoa." Or even just as a leader, how do you go in, how do you really absorb all the information and get all the context you need and then affect change? And I think what was unique about my first 90 days is it was time bound. It was literally something where you're like, "Sure, I'd love to absorb information for many months, but I just don't have the luxury of the time" and so-

Lenny (00:44:21):
Because you're going to go on mat leave right after?

Jiaona Zhang (00:44:23):
Because yeah, essentially I was going to go on mat leave.

Lenny (00:44:25):
Got it.

Jiaona Zhang (00:44:25):
That's right. And so the biggest things that I thought a lot about for my first 90 days was at the end of the day, yes, you have to really... The most important thing for anyone's for assigning days is to build context and to build context well. But what I had to think about a lot was, "How do I quickly build context probably faster than I would be given the luxury any other time in my life?" And so I thought a lot about who do I speak to at the company? How do I create even just a calendar of speaking to people? Yes, my leadership team, but also across a bunch of functions and then across a bunch of levels. So it was really important for me to even start talking to some of the engineers from the team, some of the engineers who had been there for the longest time to really understand, what's hard about our tech stack? What's going on? What's hard about your day to day?

(00:45:15):
And so I actually took time to really think about, "I want to speak to all of these types of people at the company." And I packed my first couple weeks with a lot of those meetings. And so I think that was one piece, which is like how do you build context as quickly as possible? And my tip there is again, it's not just with your peers, it's not even just with your team, but to really think across all the different functions and then think about where you're going to get the most amount of information in that particular function. I think that was one piece of it.

(00:45:43):
The other piece was I was like, "I'm going to be out." I was only out for two months, but I was like, "That's still a long period of time in the life of a startup." And so what it was really important to me was like, I did not go out having just listened and like "Great, I have the context, I'll see you in two months." But it was really important for me to actually have a plan in place before I went out for my team.

(00:46:03):
And so there were pieces where I was like, "I want to first, again, get that lay of the land. I want to have enough of a strategic, 'Hey, these things make sense. Keep going, keep executing.' 'These things don't make sense, let's identify what those things are and let's actually start to do research around these things so that when I do come back, we have a body of work that we can look at and be like, "Okay, this information, this data is making us choose to go down the path." Or "This is a go or no-go decision. We can make that decision now where we couldn't make that decision before."'"

(00:46:34):
So that was another big piece, which is getting all the strategic pieces in place, having a plan laid out and explicitly articulating in that plan, "Keep moving. These are things that we got to do a lot more research on." And then assigning people like, "Hey, you're going to do this research and then we're going to come back and talk about it in the two months that I was out." And I also took the time, I actually... Funny story, I think I literally had a board meeting the day before I went in for a checkup, and then in the checkup they're like, "You're in labor." And it was really important for me to do that because I was like, "For the things that I'm seeing, for the gaps that I'm seeing. I want everyone to be aware. I don't want to just be with one founder. I want the whole leadership team. I want all the founders, I want the board. I want everyone to be aware that."

(00:47:14):
For example, engineering hiring was really, really important. And I was communicating, "Hey, we are just not staffed in a way where we can deliver some of the ambitious things that we want to do." And so explicitly calling those things out and creating awareness around them and then asking other executives to step in and be accountable, those were big pieces of what I wanted to achieve in my first 90 days.

Lenny (00:47:34):
So I take notes on this. So the first is just get context, figure out who you need to talk to. Is there a tip there of just how many people? Because you could do this infinitely, meet everyone eventually. How many people did you end up maybe scheduling meetings with?

Jiaona Zhang (00:47:47):
Definitely everyone on my direct team and definitely everyone on the leadership team, so call it those two combined were maybe, I don't know, like 20 or so people, 25 people. But then it was really about finding the people in the other functions. And to me, for any given function, it was really getting a read from, again, that leader, but also someone closer to the actual work. And so you look at the functions, whether it's product marketing or engineering, whatever it was. Back then I didn't have designs, like design. And really getting a couple of data points for each one of those functions. So if you add that up, that probably was like 40 to 50 conversations. But again, if you're doing them back to back and you're really synthesizing, you're actually getting a really good picture of what's going on.

Lenny (00:48:35):
And then the second bucket was identify things that need to be shifted, changed, flagged. I imagine there's also an element of trust and building trust. Was that a part of this, of how you thought about it? Or do you feel like as a product leader coming in that's less essential versus say an new PM joining it? A team as an IC?

Jiaona Zhang (00:48:53):
Trust is so important. Trust is everything. As a PM, the trust that your cross-functional partners have in you, the trust that the CEO has is you... It's huge. Trust is everything. And maybe here, I'll even talk about some of the mistakes I made in the first 90 days. I think I was so much like, "I only have 90 days. I got to go, go, go. We got to go." I was almost pushing too hard. I was pushing too hard for change. I think that's the tricky part that every product leader, especially if they're coming into a new role, has to figure out how do I gain trust and then take that trust and then push for change as opposed to push for change too quickly before I have that trust?

(00:49:33):
So again, it was a personal learning and I think part of it was really driven by the time-bound nature of it, but hopefully not everyone has only 90 days. So if you take that learning into mind, it's really thinking about your trust as a bank. It's like you're putting money into your bank and then at some point you're going to take money out, you're going to use that social capital, you're going to use that trust to go push for things, push for change, but you have to be thoughtful about how full your piggy bank is and you don't want to be spending when you don't have the trust in the bank.

Lenny (00:50:06):
What were signs maybe looking back that you didn't necessarily have the trust that you thought you did or you should have had?

Jiaona Zhang (00:50:13):
I think something, a product like Webflow is a very complex product and there are so many pieces to it. It's very difficult to learn the product in the first 90 days, especially if I was also prioritizing all these conversations with the team. And so I think that again, without the time constraint, what I would recommend is to be like, "Hey, every product leader has to take the time to really go deep on the product." Given the complexity of Webflow and given the time-bound nature of when I had to go out, and given the fact I really also wanted to build that social context around what is working and not working from a function working together? Not just what the product is. What I wasn't able to do was spend enough time with the product to be able to have all of that in my back pocket to be able to be like, "Oh, I know how this, this and this works because I've literally used it a bunch."

(00:51:06):
So you had to choose. And in my head I was like, "I would much rather understand how the team is functioning together." And the reality is the team was comprised of a lot of people with a lot of deep product context. So ultimately as all things in product, you know this Lenny, everything's a trade off. And so it's a trade off. And so you had to make the call of what you wanted to trade off. And the thing I traded off the most was that product context in my first 90 days. And again, it got me some things because I was able to have the time to go deep on the things I mentioned, but it didn't give me enough trust in the piggy bank around the actual product fundamentals or product, the actual thing we're building as opposed to the discipline.

Lenny (00:51:48):
So at this point you've worked at four legendary companies, Dropbox, Airbnb, WeWork, Webflow. If we were to just go through each one, what's just one lesson that you take away from each of these companies in terms of how it's informed either how you build product or lead people, anything along those lines?

Jiaona Zhang (00:52:06):
I'm going to actually give you my biggest thing across all four on the product side. And then on the people side. There are so many nuances also, and we could spend another two hours talking about each one of these. But I think just to impart my biggest high level learning. On the product side, it's about really understanding why people love you and not forgetting to invest deeply in that core concept and then building everything around that. And so I'll walk you through the different companies. So specifically for Dropbox, I think we did waste cycles where we would be like, "Oh, we see X happening in the market. Slack is really taking off. Why don't we build a Slack competitor? Or why don't we build chat?" And I think that it really missed this idea of, "Why do people love Dropbox and what do we need to do to continue investing in that so that remains true?" People love Dropbox for simplicity, for how delightful it is, how easy it is to use.

(00:53:08):
I think we actually went for a period of time where we didn't invest enough in just performance of our client. How long it takes for the thing to sync is a big part of the experience of using Dropbox. And so I think that is a big, big learning where it's really understanding that would've shifted your investments into doing that performance work as opposed to chasing the competitive space. And I think going back to chasing the competitive space, it's this idea of what is your alpha? Again, why do people come to you? People come to Dropbox again for all the things I mentioned, but also ultimately we have your files. So if you're going and building a chat product, that's fine, but really the best chat experience or collaboration experience is going to be more around your files as opposed to around just the conversation. So I think really understanding that is a huge, huge learning.

(00:54:01):
And I think that same lesson can be... It's very true for Airbnb. So at the end of the day, Airbnb is known for all the homes, the fact that these are homes that real people put on the platform. We spent some time talking about Airbnb Plus. When you are thinking "I got to go in and I got to manage the inventory and inspect it," you're almost like taking away from the thing that is what makes Air Airbnb special as opposed to leaning into it. We also spend a lot of time on experiences. We dabbled in transportation, we spent a bunch of times on other things. But if you really sat back and you're like, "What makes Air Airbnb special and how do you double down on your strength?" It's spending the time to make that experience of really understanding what's in a home so people don't go and get surprised. Making that onboarding journey for the host and then discovery journey and guest booking journey really, really great.

(00:54:52):
So I think that that same lesson when applied to Airbnb, would've in my head changed the way we invested and I think we would've gotten more returns, as opposed to spreading ourselves and then having things that sort of work but then didn't quite work. And then again, same principle applies to WeWork, what is the thing that makes you really special? It's the inventory it. It's not actually like, "Oh, it's so amazing that I get to use this key card and this key card does 10 different things." That's not what makes the WeWork experience special. And so again, if you knew that you wouldn't spend all that time being like, "I'm going to really deeply invest in the tech team, I'm going to do all these interesting things." You'd be like, "I just need to make inventory management great. I need to make it so that the sales team, the operations team, they have the tools they need to go out and get the inventory on the platform." You wouldn't do all this other stuff that's just not the core.

(00:55:44):
And then finally, even at Webflow, we are learning this lesson all the time where at the end of the day, people really love our designer. They love the fact that they can use it. It does so much for them, it's so powerful. And then you add our CMS and it's really powerful. You can design with data. So investing deeply there as opposed to spreading ourselves too thin is also a lesson. I think across so many companies this lesson around understand why people love you, double down on that and then whatever else you build around it... Because again, you don't want to also be like... You're not like a single product company, you're not like a one trick pony. You are going to invest in these multi products, but when you invest in a new product, really go back to, again, what's the core of our advantage and how can that be something we leverage in delivering a really great product experience for our users in X adjacent area or x add-on?

Lenny (00:56:34):
Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round.

Jiaona Zhang (00:56:38):
Okay.

Lenny (00:56:38):
What is the best advice that you've gotten that has transformed or impacted the way you build product or hire or lead? Does anything come to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (00:56:48):
I can't remember where I explicitly got this advice, but I feel like I got it in multiple forms and it just really sat with me. It's this idea of asking for help. I do think about that a lot because I think there are so many times when you're like, "Oh, I'm the leader of X thing, everyone's looking to me like the [inaudible 00:57:04] stops in me. I need to have my act together. I can't be asking for help. If I'm asking for help, is everyone feel like I don't know what I'm doing?"

(00:57:13):
And ever since I've been people managing, I've been pushing myself to be like, "I know it feels non-intuitive to go ask for help when everyone is looking to for you to give them advice, but if you don't ask for help, there's so many times where you're just going to be sitting there with your problems. Whatever you have in your mind is just not the global best thing and you have to go ask for help. You have to go ask for help from your partners, your peers, even your team, even being my team, I don't know. I really don't know. Here's the guidelines, here's how you might want to think about it, but I don't know the answer, you know the answer." Going out and getting mentorship. I think this idea of really being able to say, "Be honest about what you know and what you don't know and ask for help when you don't know something," that's probably the biggest thing that I hold as a core principle and just helps me build better products.

Lenny (00:58:03):
What's something that you've asked for help about recently as an example?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:06):
So I'm working on our product strategy for the next three years. I'm thinking a lot about how do we really leverage AI to support all of our service providers and support all our users who come into Webflow and have a hard time sometimes learning how to use our product. And so I'm not an AI expert, so asking for help from the founders, from external folks, from engineers to be like, "What's happening?" Every single week I feel like LLMs are changing. What's possible in the world is changing. And so constantly asking for help to iterate on the strategy is a huge part of... It's happening every day for me and my job.

Lenny (00:58:40):
JZ, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:44):
All right, let's do it.

Lenny (00:58:46):
What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:50):
I love the Design Sprint by Google. I also really Julie's book around managing people how to be a good manager. That one's really great. And so those are my more business side of the house books. And then we can also talk about fantasy stuff if you want. But-

Lenny (00:59:07):
Yeah, give us some recs there.

Jiaona Zhang (00:59:09):
I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson. He completed the Wheel of Time series on behalf of the [inaudible 00:59:14] author. He has the Mistborn series and so he's a great one. He actually has this... During the pandemic, he holed up and wrote a bunch of books and Vince was like, "I have a confession to make. I wrote four extra books." And the latest one is Tress by the Emerald Sea that I really love.

Lenny (00:59:32):
I saw the video of him sharing that news and he's just like, "I wrote a book during COVID" and then, "Okay, I wrote a second book and then, oh, I wrote a third book also" and it just keeps going.

Jiaona Zhang (00:59:43):
I think he was like, "I have a secret or I have a confession to make." And everyone was like, "Oh no, are you going to say that you have a ghost writer because you're so prolific?" And he's like, "Nope, I just wrote four more books."

Lenny (00:59:51):
What a beast. Next question on that topic a little bit. What's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you watched? And I know you said you don't get to watch much, but anything come to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:01):
I feel like every night I'm watching Sesame Street like songs. We don't do TV, but we do do YouTube songs. I honestly don't have an answer to that other than we watch the Elmo song and the ABC song with my three year old.

Lenny (01:00:18):
There's been a lot of parenting advice on this podcast with my child coming soon. And so this is very on brand. Before we started this, you mentioned the painting behind you is referenced in like Arcane, it's connected to or the show Arcane, which I imagine-

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:31):
Yes. I'm a big fan. So painted this a long time ago before Jinx and Vi were a thing, and when Arcane was made, both my husband and I were like, "What? How did we predict this? This is amazing." So it's a good one.

Lenny (01:00:45):
There we go. Some adult content. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:53):
I do like to do behavioral questions, just really understanding when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate ambiguity? Is a big one for me because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. So asking a lot of behavioral questions around that.

Lenny (01:01:14):
And is there anything specific you look for in their answer that tells you this is a good answer or not a good answer?

Jiaona Zhang (01:01:20):
Yeah. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity," but actually put a path forward. I think also looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs as opposed to being like, "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear." Because again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, "This is the path, this is how I learned why I put this path together." And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, "Hey, is this working? Is this not working?" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.

Lenny (01:02:12):
Awesome. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Jiaona Zhang (01:02:17):
I love... It's not recent, but I do love the SNOO and it's very top of mind because I just graduated my second son from the SNOO and it was a little bit like, "Oh my gosh, no more rocking of the baby." But I do think it does a good job of actually doing the thing and I'm also giving parents peace of mind.

(01:02:34):
The other thing I'm a big fan of, again, you'll see where my head's at, lots of child related things. Midjourney for your toddler is actually great because instead of it being absolute instant gratification of "I want to see a firetruck," and "Here you go, here's my phone." It's like, "Let's wait for Midjourney to create the firetruck." And specifically you can even tell Midjourney what you want. It could be like, "I would like it to be blue." He's obsessed with Jungle Book, "Wearing a fire hat next to a firetruck." And so you can actually create, and I do believe in the future, so much of what we are going to be doing as humans is literally what is the creative process? What's the idea? It's less about executing all the pieces of it, but it's so important to still be able to be like "This is the idea that I want to bring to life." And so I just think training that is huge.

Lenny (01:03:24):
Feels like you've just defined your three-year strategy for Webflow right there with AI.

(01:03:30):
Next question, what is something that you've changed in the way you build product that might be relatively minor that had a big impact in your team's ability to execute?

Jiaona Zhang (01:03:40):
There's so many different things that we've done at all the different companies. It really depends on the company. And what I mean by that is at a company like Webflow, where the tech stack is complex and where a given feature has so many different interactions, you're like "People depend on this workflow, this thing interacts with this thing. It's a whole platform." One of the biggest things we've been tweaking is like how do we do more of a tech spike at the beginning to be like, "Do we have a good sense of how difficult this is going to be? The unknowns? Can we get a little bit more detail on them so that we don't go down a path and be like, 'Oh, this doesn't make sense'?" So I feel like that that's a tweak in the process that has really made a big difference at a company like Webflow.

(01:04:20):
But when I look back to other companies, again, that might not be your biggest problem. Another problem could be like, "Hey, it's just so difficult to work with cross-functional partners and doing a little tweak in the process where you bring them in a kickoff meeting." That might be the thing that just changes that dynamic of how you work with teams. So it's really... I don't know if there's one thing, but it's almost like every day I'm thinking about small tweaks and process to make all of us more efficient.

Lenny (01:04:44):
Final question, what is your number one pro-tip for using Webflow and being successful with Webflow?

Jiaona Zhang (01:04:49):
My number one pro-tip is there's a lot of stuff coming out that I'm very excited about. I do think Webflow has traditionally had a high learning curve, and it's because we're a pro tool, we're a professional tool. We do really amazing stuff, so much power that we deliver you, but with that power has come with it's hard to learn. And so one of the things that I'm really excited about pro-tip for using Webflow in the future is we're really going to bring the magic of Webflow University, the magic of AI, all together so that you can just use and learn Webflow so much faster, learn webflow in the context of what you're doing as opposed to going into a different tab and looking for the Webflow University stuff. It's going to be in context to the product, being able to actually take action directly, prompting Webflow to be able to do things for you. It's just going to be so much easier in the future to use the product. That's what I'm excited about. We're working on it and it will be out in the future.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Okay. No specific dates yet. Yeah, you could share, this sounds like breaking news of cool stuff coming.

Jiaona Zhang (01:05:47):
Some things are in alpha and [inaudible 01:05:49] beta, but we do want to be developing it with our users and really learning is this the power that you're looking for? Is this thing that's going to get you over the activation hump that you've struggled with in the past?

Lenny (01:06:00):
JZ, I think we've made a maximally lovable podcast episode. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. How can listeners find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jiaona Zhang (01:06:11):
I always love feedback, so if there's feedback on the podcast, send it my way. Or even just what would you want to learn? Send it my way. And the reason I ask that is because I'm actually working on a course, another course through Reforge, which is around managing your PM career. And so really just... I've talked to so many people advice around their career, but if you want to reach out and be like, "These are the problems that I'm facing," it would actually really help me as I am creating this course, which is going to launch in a couple of months. And so I'm excited to... Find me there if you want to chat more and send the problems that you're struggling with when it comes to your career, and that would help me refine my course.

Lenny (01:06:47):
And that's just reforge.com? There's no URL yet specifically for that course?

Jiaona Zhang (01:06:51):
Not yet, but it will come soon. And maybe what I'll do is I'll post it on my website, which is built in Webflow, so my full name dotcom.

Lenny (01:06:59):
Got it. JZ, thank you so much for being here, and thanks again.

Jiaona Zhang (01:07:03):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:07:05):

# How embracing your emotions will accelerate your career | Joe Hudson (Art of Accomplishment)

## Transcript

Joe Hudson (00:00:00):
A lot of the people in my circles may have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange a life that they enjoy, and it doesn't fucking work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
What is holding people back?

Joe Hudson (00:00:09):
It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling, or expressing. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
What the hell? Why would... Why does this... You have this really amazing insight. The voice in your head is often telling you bullshit.

Joe Hudson (00:00:27):
What most people try to do is they try to stop it, and that doesn't work very well. I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day. One of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
You're really big on helping people feel joy.

Joe Hudson (00:00:45):
It's such an important tool for productivity. If you say, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient. Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone try to experiment with?

Joe Hudson (00:01:02):
Yeah, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Today, my guest is Joe Hudson. Joe is one of the most sought-after executive coaches amongst tech leaders and has worked with folks from OpenAI, SpaceX, Apple, and other world-class companies. Joe's unique approach to coaching draws from his spiritual, psychological, and neurological practices. In his intimate courses that he runs a few times a year, and in his podcast, he helps people create the life that they want with enjoyment and ease. In our conversation, Joe shares the two things that he finds most often keep people stuck in their life and in their job, and how to work on getting these things unstuck. Why the critical voice in your head is always wrong, contradictory, and telling you bullshit, and how to build a different relationship with that voice.

(00:01:51):
Why falling in love with your emotions is so important and so powerful. Why you'd be better off focusing on what you want versus what you think you should do or think that you need to do, plus a bunch of amazing advice on how to make better decisions, help your team run more effectively, and why a seven-minute daily gratitude practice will change your life. This episode is basically for every single person. It will make your life and your work better. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Joe Hudson. Joe, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Joe Hudson (00:02:34):
Oh, thanks. Good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:36):
It's good to have you. I'm curious if there's any common themes that emerge often in terms of what is holding people back from success or just living the life that they want, especially ambitious tech people, which I know is a lot of the folks that you work with. Are there archetypes of like, here's the thing, often come up most often and hold people back?

Joe Hudson (00:02:57):
A nonspecific answer to that would be a critical voice in their head and a relationship with that critical voice that is not productive. Oftentimes, the critical voice in the head says, "You need me to be productive," but it's usually a huge detriment to being able to really be successful. Even if you are successful with a really critical voice in your head, you never get to enjoy it. You might have the money, but then you're like, "Oh, shit, I'm still miserable." Or, "I got the car, I got the house, I got the money, I got the successful career, and why am I unhappy all the time?" That would be, I would say one of the biggest ones. Another really big one that in a large category I would say is their relationship with emotions is all fakata. They are either trying to pretend they don't have them or compartmentalizing them or trying to manage them rather than harnessing them and falling in love with them. That would be a big place.

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.

(00:06:05):
This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com. These are awesome. Okay, so the voice in your head, you have this really amazing insight that I heard on one of your podcast episodes that the voice in your head is often wrong, often contradictory, often telling you, and that your advice is to learn how to work very differently with this voice in your head, which a lot of people just assume, oh, that's just like what it is. It's telling me how it's trying to help me, but it turns out it's not. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:07:04):
I would say every single time the voice in your head is wrong. That critical voice in your head. To be specific, I'm talking about the voice in your head that is critical and repeats. There's the voice that says the same thing over and over again. You got to work out more, you got to work out more, you got to work out more. Whatever that is, it's always wrong, and that doesn't mean there isn't truth to what it says, but it's incorrect. As an example of this, you should work out more, you should work out more, you should work out more, or you need me or you just sit around on the couch as a great example of one. If I was your boss and I was sitting right next to you and I was criticizing you every couple of minutes, there's no way that you would say, "Wow, I really need you. I couldn't be productive without you." It's a bunch of crap. Or you should work out, you should work out.

(00:07:58):
I see the truth that I'd be healthier if I work out. I get that. Should I? Is it really a should? There's another question. What makes it not say, "Oh, hey, why don't you enjoy working out? How do we get you to enjoy working out? What would motivate you to work?" It's not doing any of that. It's, "You should work out, you should work out." It's never an accurate thing that's happening inside of your head. Until you can see through that, it's hard to work with the voice in your head. You can do it, but until you see through it. The second part that I would say is that if you want to work with the voice in your head a new way, what most people try to do is they try to stop it. They try to control the voice in the head, and that doesn't work very well. Instead, I say, change the way that you relate to the negative voice in your head.

(00:08:46):
Instead of being, "Okay, stop doing that, stop doing that." Say, "Oh, I see that you're really scared and I'm right here with you." Or sing a musical to it or just go, "Eh, I don't believe you." As a matter of fact, I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day to have an experimental approach and say, "Oh, what's the relationship I want with this negative voice in my head?" Because right now, what it's typically doing for most people is that it says something and the person's like, "Yeah." Or, "Yeah, but I'm not going to do that, so fuck off." Or, "Yeah, that'll never work." Something like that is the response. What happens if you change the response to the voice in your head? That gives you a crap ton of freedom, and it's the beginning of what can be a state where the negative voice in the head disappears, which is really, really quite lovely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):
Oh, wow. I love this so much because there's so much that comes from this thing in your head just shooting you down or scaring you about stuff. It's so hard. I hear this, but it's so hard. Next time I'm, I don't know, giving a big presentation, I'm going to hear like, "Oh, something could go wrong. You could look really stupid or you could totally forget what you're saying." It's hard to really intellectualize, okay, I don't have to listen to this. Is there anything more there just how to turn that around and be like, just shut up?

Joe Hudson (00:10:11):
The shut up usually doesn't work. Experiment with all of it. To me, one of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you." Because part of the deal is that the voice in the head has assumed the position that it's like the boss, but it's really a little kid having a temper tantrum. If you listen to it, if you just dictated everything it said, it sounds like usually like a five-year-old having a temper tantrum, or it sounds like the way your mom used to chastise you or the way your dad used to chastise you or whatever, a teacher. It isn't, it's not logical, it's not thoughtful, it's typically not thoughtful, it's usually abusive. It's a lot of fear. It's one of my favorites, one of my favorite ways to respond.

(00:11:06):
I've tried, I mean, gosh, dozens of ways, and there's a lot of neat effective ways. I particularly think it's really good to set up a series of experiments rather than just take the one that I have because the experimental mindset means that you can never really fail. Typically, somebody, like worse with the voice in the head, they fail and they go, "Ah, fuck it." Because we have this part of our brain called the habenula, and the habenula basically is the part of our brain that is trying to teach us not to fail over and over again. It's the thing that when you go on a diet or you go to work out and then you don't do it one day and you say, "Ah, fuck it, I messed up," and then you don't try anymore or you don't try for a couple of weeks or whatever, that's basically what's happening in that part of the brain.

(00:11:48):
If you do it as an experimental thing, then you can't lose, you're just learning about yourself. You're learning about the voice in your head. The way I like thinking about that is people are like, "I understand the problem, but I don't have a solution." I'm always like, "If you understood the problem, there would be no question about the solution." If you fully understand the problem, you know the solution. All you have to do is really fully understand the voice in your head through a series of experiments and the whole thing goes away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
The advice here is next time you're hearing something in your head that you don't think is going to be helpful to you is try to respond to it in a different way from what you've been doing.

Joe Hudson (00:12:25):
I would be even more subtle than that, which is I really wouldn't care if you think it's helpful to you or not. I would just experiment with different ways of interacting with it. I wouldn't even do it as a goal of, okay, I want the voice in the head to be nicer to me. I would do it with the goal of just, hey, how do I learn? How do I understand this thing? It's a far more productive self-development. Generally, it's far more productive to learn, say about the river valley by walking through it, putting your feet in the river, going down the river with a canoe, smelling the soil, looking at the plants, than it is to say, "Okay, I am going to dam this river valley and try to..." You're not going to understand it the same way. You're going to make some mistakes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
Amazing. The second bucket that you shared of what you find most often is the root of what's holding people back is the way you described is your relationship with your emotions, which I don't think a lot of people would think of as the thing that's holding them back. Can you talk a bit more about what that looks like?

Joe Hudson (00:13:31):
Yeah, a great way to explain it. For the logical folks, so in 2012 or so, there was a person who wrote a book called Descartes' Error, and in Descartes' Error, the whole idea is that I think therefore I am, and this person's like, "Yeah, that's the error." It's a neuroscientist who looked at people who had damage in the emotional center of their brain, and they just basically ceased to be able to make decisions. Their IQ would stay the same, but it would take them half an hour to decide where to have lunch or decide what color pen to use. It would take hours and hours to make simple decisions, so their IQ would stay high, but their entire life would completely fall apart. What it tells us, and this is not exact, I'm paraphrasing for a podcast, but we make decisions in the emotional center of our brain. We use logic to try to figure out how we're going to feel.

(00:14:23):
You can see this just by asking yourself the question, how many decisions have you made to feel like a success or to not feel like a failure or to feel happier, to not feel trapped? There's these huge buckets of emotions that we are trying to feel and not feel, and we're making decisions based on those. There's no such thing as a logical decision. That idea is like, I'm just going to be logical and just make a logical decision, it doesn't. Neurologically, it's just untrue. If you learn to fall in love with all of your emotions, then solution sets become available that you didn't have before. If you are like, "Oh, I can't feel like a failure." Well, then you're probably not going to take certain risks. If you are, "Oh, I want to feel loved and I can't feel unliked by people." Well, then you're not going to say your truth, and then the world is going to not give you the things that are truthful to you.

(00:15:20):
I go into my boss, I say my truth, I get fired. Okay, I get fired, but then probably my next boss, I say my truth, I'm going to find a location where my truth is and how I want to be in the world is going to be acceptable. If I don't do that, if I'm constantly managing myself, then I'm not going to have that reality. It's really important, just for the decision-making part, how important emotions are to be able to fall in love with each of the emotional experiences so you're not making decisions based on your inability to feel stuff. That's like one, there's literally a thousand others. Most people, they feel stuck. They can have a big emotional release and they don't feel stuck anymore. When people feel overwhelmed, it's usually not the amount of crap that they have going on in their life. It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling or expressing. That's another huge chunk of stuff.

(00:16:11):
Depression is usually unmoved anger, is another example. There's so many levels in which people not able to feel really limits their life. Just one that's like almost everybody can relate to is feeling excitement is something that most people can only do for about 10 to 20 seconds. Most people aren't like, "Oh, I'm excited." If you walked into a Denny's and there was this person, a 60-year-old man and just excited and was excited for 10 minutes, you'd be like, "What's wrong with this person?" When we're excited, it's contagious. I walk into a meeting and I'm excited, probably other people are going to walk out excited. We're limiting just our ability to create collaboration by the fact that we're limited by our excitement. I could go on forever. There's so many experiences like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):
What I'm hearing is the core issues, we're not able to feel our emotion, but there's something there, like we are angry or scared. Because we can't feel it, we just can't break through that.

Joe Hudson (00:17:17):
Not quite. If you have somebody who's experienced a lot of emotional abuse in their life, then they might not be able to feel the emotions that they're having, and particularly where you experienced the emotional abuse. That might be the case for them. For instance, if you had physical abuse and I put a quarter in one of your hands and a key in another one of your hands without telling you which was which, you wouldn't be able to tell me if you'd suffered enough physical abuse because you've literally cut that sensation off. Similarly, people who've experienced emotional abuse can often not tell what the emotions are. Now, emotional abuse is, it's a big word. Generally, people don't even like equating the two. Just to agree on terms here, when I say emotional abuse, I mean you were told that you weren't allowed to have a certain emotion. That's what I mean by emotional abuse.

(00:18:08):
Maybe you got fed every time you got angry or you got your love removed, or you got punished, or maybe every time you cried, you were made fun of. My particular background was that. It's when you weren't allowed to feel certain emotions, you were told to cut it off because it wasn't going to be safe because you're either going to get bribed out of it or punished out of it, or loved removed because of it or made fun of or whatever it is. That might be a step that one has to take, but the place you want to get to is where the emotions are fluid, where it just moves right through you. It doesn't mean that you lose control. As a matter of fact, losing control means that there's still resistance in it.

(00:18:53):
The way I think about this is that emotions are like a tube, let's say, and there's water moving through the tube. You kink a tube one way, the water comes out a little funny. Kink the tube the other way, it comes a little funny. Let's say you have anger and that's the tube of, and you kink it one way and it's like, "You son of a bitch. You blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." You kink get another way and it's like, "Nice dress. You crank it another way and it's guilt. It's like, "Why would you ever do that to me?" Then if it's unkinked, then it's like Gandhi or Martin Luther king. It's this very loving boundary that's set. It's this clarity of purpose. That's how I think about it. The idea is to get to fluidity, to unkink the hose so that all of the emotional experiences come out with love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:44):
I did a meditation retreat, a 10-day silent meditation retreat, which I know is a big part of your practice and something that led to the work you do now. A term that's coming up for me is non-judgmental awareness. Basically, experiencing the thing you're feeling and just letting it go, not attaching to it, not judging it. Is that along the lines of stuff you'd recommend?

Joe Hudson (00:20:03):
Yeah, it's definitely a huge part of it. There's a couple of things that I noticed get in the way, or the translation gets in the way there. One is it's like, think about emotions as like kids in your house. If a kid came into your house and you're like, "I will be non-judgmentally aware of you." You're probably going to get a very different response from the kid than if you're like, "Oh, I'm so excited to see you. I welcome you in my house." The emotions feel different if you're like, "I am non-judgmentally aware of this emotion," or, "Oh, cool. Oh cool, I'm sad. This is fantastic." If you have that welcoming invitation. One of the quotes that I'm most famous for is joy is the matriarch of a family of emotions and she won't come into a house where her children aren't welcome. A very joyful life is a life where all the other emotions are deeply welcomed, not accepted, not non-judgmentally aware of. I think those are really great steps, don't get me wrong. If you can be in non-judgmental awareness of an emotion, fantastic.

(00:21:14):
The other thing that's a little bit different about what you said is that emotions do need to be felt. If you stop feeling an emotion, you have to constrict your muscles. I can watch somebody come in, come up for one of my coaching rapid coaching sessions. By the crease in their eyebrow, I can know that there's repressed anger. By the hunch in their shoulders, I can tell you about the critical parent that they had. The body takes on a shape that's based on the emotions that you've been taught to hold. You don't just by sitting there, well, it's not entirely true, if you just sit there and feel them in that way without the full expression, they will move eventually, but it might take a couple of decades. You can actually just move them. You can actually make the sound, move your body. All mammals do it. Like mammals releasing fear, they all shake. It's part of how we exist. That's also a really big part of emotional fluidity. It's not just being still and feeling them, it's letting the muscles move, making the sounds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
For someone that wants to get better at the skill of feeling emotions, being more in touch with emotions, helping their emotions be more fluid. I know this is a lifelong practice and not something you would just hear on a podcast, okay, I've installed this. Is there anything tactically you can recommend to a listener of just like, here's something you could do this week that'll help you, along these lines?

Joe Hudson (00:22:40):
We have a free audio on our website called Emotional Inquiry, and that would be the easiest way that I would, that's a really good entry level first step into emotional fluidity. The bigger problem is that every step has a different thing. If you're in the not aware of emotions, then that step may not be the right step for you. Though, if you are aware two or three emotions and you can do emotional inquiry, usually, it'll open up a lot of the other ones. There might be a point where you really need expression, and so emotional inquiry is not going to work. Just generally, the emotional inquiry practice is a really good one. What it is, is imagine you're a little kid and you pick up a toad.

(00:23:28):
You're going to pick it up, you're going to look at it, you're going to feel it, you're going to smell it. Some little kids are even going to lick it a little bit. They're going to really want to explore this toad, and that's what emotional inquiry is, is a somatic mental experiencing of an emotional experience in your body and what is it like and what happens when you welcome it. What happens when you love it. What happens when you resist it. It's a series of experiments that you're playing with the emotion and observations and felt sense of the emotion, and that I find to be incredibly, incredibly useful for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):
Just getting very curious.

Joe Hudson (00:24:06):
Yeah, a lot of wonder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
By the way, the quote you shared about joy being the matriarchy of all the other emotions, imagine people have said this, but inside out too, I think is exactly a representation of what you're talking about, where joy is actually, she's like the protagonist almost. I don't know if you've seen it yet.

Joe Hudson (00:24:25):
I think I've heard about this. I haven't watched it, but I think where you think it's all about being happy and you find out that you have to accept everything for happiness to really work, kind of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
Exactly.

Joe Hudson (00:24:35):
Yeah, I have heard about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):
Anxiety takes over, and then things don't go well. Something else that I've noticed listening to a bunch of your conversations, you do these lightning round coaching sessions with people, and so I listen to a bunch of them. Something that was really interesting to me is that a lot of people come to you and they're like, "Hey, I have this problem. I can't do this hard thing I know I need to do." Or, "I have imposter syndrome just keeping me from doing this thing I need to do." you're often like, "No, that's not actually what's going on here. I can see that's not a problem for you. It's really this other thing." Is that super common where people think they need to work on this one thing, and it turns out that's not at all, they're actually okay at that and something totally else?

Joe Hudson (00:25:13):
I'd maybe put it a little bit differently. They're living in a story that describes an old version of themselves or they don't see themselves clearly enough to be able to see the whole issue, and so they're just kind of living with a story that's in the past. That's a really common thing. Oftentimes, if I do that in a coaching session, typically it's because they're showing me right there that it's not true. Somebody's like, "I'm so scared, I can't do anything." I'm like, "You just got in front of a hundred people to ask me a question. Clearly, you're not so scared that you can't do anything, so I'm not buying it." I don't do it quite like that, I do it with a lot more love than that.

(00:25:54):
Oftentimes, I see that people's stories are a culprit, like how they describe themselves. A great way that you can really see this in folks is that nine out of 10 times that you compliment somebody, I really appreciate this thing about you, they're going to go, "Nah." Or, "Well, my sister is even more." Or, "If you knew me." They're going to do some sort of version like that. It basically is one of the indicators that they can't actually feel who they are. They would rather, in effect, call you a liar. You're lying to me or you're wrong than they would to actually accept the experience of being seen in that way. It does a couple of things. One of the things it does is it stops people from seeing themselves clearly. The other thing it does is it makes people forever want to be seen and complimented and acknowledged and validated because they're getting the food, but they can't digest it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Do you have any advice other than working with you and you telling them, "Hey, here's actually going on," for someone to like, okay, maybe revisit, maybe this isn't actually a problem to see what's actually going on?

Joe Hudson (00:27:09):
We have a set of five kind of what we think are foundational tools for transformation, and we do these free workshops on them, and one of them is question the assumption. That's a really great way to have people start to see through their stories. At the beginning, I said, "Nothing in the critical voice in your head says is true." This is how it applies, so typically, there's an assumption that you have to make for the problem to be real. If somebody says to you, for instance, if somebody comes to me and says, "I am an asshole to my girlfriend." That's their problem. One, you have to assume that the girlfriend doesn't want you to be an asshole, as an example. Two, you have to assume that you know what being an asshole actually is. It's not just what your mom told you an asshole was.

(00:28:04):
Three, there's some validation, there's another assumption, there's some clear thing that says this in the world. Everyone's like, that's an asshole and that's not, rather than what actually happens in the world, which is 50% of the people think that this person is an asshole and 50% think they're a hero. It's something like that. Also, another assumption there is that the problem is that you're an asshole, instead of that you're resisting the fact that you are an asshole, and therefore, it comes out sideways instead of really clear. There's so many assumptions in there. If you see through those assumptions, usually the problem starts fading away.

(00:28:40):
It's like, "Oh, okay, what do I mean by asshole, exactly? How do I define that?" It seems like a silly thing when I am using this example of asshole. I remember this moment in my own development, I was in Bodega Bay, out of all places, and this very good friend of mine at the time was like, "Joe, you're an asshole." I was like, "No, I'm not." He's like, "Why resist it? Just fall in love with the fact that you're an asshole. Just allow yourself to be an asshole for just a minute, just one minute." I stopped, and I thought of like, I was doing venture capital at the time, and I could think of all the things that I had done that somebody would call an asshole, and all the ways in which I was unattuned to people, and I could, "Oh, yeah, okay, I can totally see that I'm an asshole."

(00:29:32):
In that scene, not only in the scene of it, but as the shame fell away, oh, this is nothing I have to defend. This isn't something that I'm a bad person because of, I don't need to be ashamed of it. This is just some actions that I took. As that faded away, then and then over the next couple weeks, lo and behold, I became less of an asshole. It's a strange thing when you really grok that, that it's often shame that holds bad habits in place. Is it a problem that I'm an asshole, or is the problem that I'm ashamed of being an asshole? Is the problem that you're a smoker, is the problem that you're ashamed of being a smoker? Typically, there's so many assumptions built into everything that we call a problem, and if we look through those assumptions, the problems disappear. As in this case, it disappeared for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Wow, okay. There's a lot there. It connects to something I know you recently talked about, which is the emotion we want to avoid is the thing we end up experiencing a lot by trying to avoid it. What's going on there?

Joe Hudson (00:30:46):
Since I'm coach executives, let's do an executive example, so conflict avoidant executive. I don't want to feel the out of control in this that I do when people argue. I don't want to feel that level of out of control, so I am going to be conflict avoidant. I'm going to avoid conflict. Every way that we go to avoid a feeling, becomes the way that, that feeling gets invited towards us. We all know what it's like to work for a conflict-avoidant CEO or a boss, people get really fucking upset. Eventually, people get really upset. Decisions aren't being made. There's all this tension. It's never relieved.

(00:31:30):
Then wow, sure enough, the conflict-avoidant CEO is dealing with a whole organization that's tense and they feel completely out of control and the fact that they can't do anything about, so that's an example. Or when I was younger, it was emotional abandonment. My dad was an alcoholic, and I didn't want to feel that emotional abandonment again, and so I would get really hard when I felt like people were leaving me, I'd be like, "What the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah?" Which of course, made them abandon me quicker, or I would try to caretaker people, which would build resentment, which would make people abandon me. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
What the hell? Why does this happen?

Joe Hudson (00:32:14):
That doesn't sound right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
This is counterproductive.

Joe Hudson (00:32:20):
It is counterproductive. I think that the really cool thing about it is you can look at any issue that you're having in your life, so you can say, oh, one of the problems that I have in my life is that I am constantly in an argument with my girlfriend or boyfriend, let's say. What is the thing that you don't want to feel in that argument? I don't want to feel ashamed. You're getting in arguments because you don't want to feel ashamed, and that's making you feel more ashamed. What am I doing at that first time to not feel ashamed? I'm defending myself. Oh, and me defending myself is actually the thing that's starting the fight. You can backward engineer it to, oh, I don't want to feel ashamed, therefore I'm going to defend myself, which creates the fight, which makes me feel more ashamed.

(00:33:10):
Any problem that you're having, you can actually backwards engineer it and see, oh, I can solve that problem by just being okay with that feeling. God damn it, you didn't take out the trash. Oh, that's a shame I don't want to feel. I'm not going to defend myself. I'm going to feel that shame. Oh, yeah, then maybe I'm going to say I'm sorry I didn't take out the trash, or I'm going to say, I don't feel ashamed, I don't want to take out the trash. I have to defend myself to get in the fight, and then I'm going to feel ashamed. You can reverse engineer all your problems this way. It's like it's such a cool hack, but it's very hard. For somehow or another, it's very simple, but very hard for people to utilize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:53):
This is amazing. The advice is basically feel the thing and just come to terms with this is the emotion I'm feeling, and maybe, like an example, the asshole. Well, maybe I'm an asshole.

Joe Hudson (00:34:03):
It's what's required for you to love and accept yourself would be, and love and accept the emotion that you're having in the moment instead of resist it. There's that saying, what we resist persists. How do you fall in love with and stop resisting the reality on the ground? In doing so, it changes the reality on the ground.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):
In this argument with your supposed girlfriend, say you disagree about her perspective on what's going on. I guess that's not the root issue here. It's your feeling, it's not her perception.

Joe Hudson (00:34:41):
Hey, sweetheart, I really hear you want me to take out the trash, and that's not my truth. That's going to be very different than defending that shame. The defending the shame is going to be like, no, it's not my job to take out the chat. You're trying not to feel the experience, which is what's going to do it. The response isn't the important thing. It's really where the response comes from. It's so interesting because people are taught constantly, this is something we teach in the connection courses that it's really not about the conversation, it's about where you're at in the conversation. For instance, when my friend said to me, "Hey, you're a dick." Here's what he didn't do, he's like, he didn't go, "You're a dick. You asshole. You're being an asshole. You're being a dick. Fucking stop it." He was like, "Eh, you're a dick, so what? What's the problem?" He was coming from a place of love for me, and so I could not be defended in my response to him. It's really where you come from.

(00:35:49):
It's the emotionally where you come from, that's the important part. Not as much what you say. You can see this, a perfect example of this is, this happens all the time in my work. Let's say there's a person who has a CEO and the person is scared of their CEO. Let's say this is the CMO, and they're, "I'm scared of the CEO. I can't say my truth. They're always getting upset. They're going to yell, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." I'll say, yeah, there's one person who says it though. The answer is always yes. That CEO has one person who they don't yell at, who they listen to, who they'll take the objection from, that they don't get angry with. It's because there's somebody who doesn't approach them in fear. It's because somebody approaches them a different way. Not with judgment, but like, "Hey, look, this is what we have to pay attention to." It's really about how you're coming at it and not what you're saying typically.

I'm very happy with what advice we've already shared and there's more I want to tap into.

Joe Hudson (00:38:04):
You keep using the word advice, and I just want to, so for anybody who's listening, do not take my advice. Do not, do not, do not. Test it. Experiment. Set up an experiment, try it out. See if it's true for you. It's one, I just made this shit up. Somebody else could make up something different. It's like Jeff Bezos made up Amazon. We make stuff up, but we're humans. Two, is if you instead of just listen to it as a soundbite, if you actually do it and make an experiment out of it, you get to learn. It's in your bones. You get to see what's actually real for you. What's real for you in this moment might not be real for you what's in the next moment. For instance, I could give the advice that says, hey, you can't even control your thoughts.

(00:38:55):
You can't even decide what thought you are going to have next is, it's just going to fucking happen. you're completely out of control, and so it's all a gift. Can you look at life as all a gift? Wow, that could be really useful for one person, but the other person, they feel so disempowered that they're like, "I can't even control my own thoughts. Man, I am totally trapped." They might really need at that moment to learn that, "Oh, I have empowerment, I have choice." That's the advice that they need to hear. Do the experiment, find out what's true for you in this moment. If there's a piece of advice, that's the one I want to give.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:40):
let's share more experiments people can run. Another is this thread that I feel comes up a lot in your work is you're just really big on helping people feel joy. Feels like that's the core of what you're trying to help people is feel more joy. Why is that so important? Why is joy so important, so powerful?

Joe Hudson (00:39:57):
I definitely would not want anyone to feel joy. I wouldn't want to push somebody into or like, "Hey, you should feel joy." What I would say that's a close cousin to that is that enjoyment is such an important tool for productivity. Enjoyment is such an important tool for living a meaningful life. Enjoyment is an amazing tool. As an example, let's say you drive a Ferrari, you're not going to say, hey, that's an efficient car. That's a super-efficient car. You're going to say, no, that's a fast car. Somehow in our own lives, if we get something done quickly, we're efficient, but that's not efficient. You can go and get something done quickly and then you're so exhausted. What's efficient is if at the end of whatever you did, you feel like you have more energy, like you're stoked, like, oh, I can't wait to do this again tomorrow. That's efficiency, is that you've actually used the least amount of energy to get something done. If you say, oh, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient.

(00:41:13):
Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too. If you enjoy running, you're probably going to run more than if you don't enjoy running. If you enjoy doing a podcast, you're probably going to make a better podcast and you're going to do it for longer if you enjoy doing it. There's something really, really important about enjoyment because it's not only a measure of efficiency, it also has a strong correlation with hire in most things has a strong correlation with how long you're going to do it, your staying power, the quality of what you're going to do, all of that. That's one of the reasons that I think enjoyment is really great. The other thing is that if you enjoy things, they feel different. I think one of the things that people do is they say this, they say, "I want to enjoy my life more, so I'm going to do less things, take out the trash, and I'm going to do more things like go on vacation."

(00:42:14):
That's not how enjoyment works. You can enjoy taking out the trash or you can hate taking out the trash. That's a choice. Right now, somebody listening to this as an experiment that they can run is like, okay, you're going to stay listening to this for the next minute. How do you enjoy it 10% more? Typically, what will happen is somebody will take a deeper breath, they'll settle into their body a little bit more, they'll relax a little bit more. They might physically get more comfortable. There's a thousand things that they might do to just enjoy the experience 10% more. That, and in that, they're becoming more efficient in that the quality is getting better in that they're hearing what I'm saying differently. It's just a really powerful tool. What I know the problem to be is that some people will go, "Okay, now I have to enjoy life. I'm going to disregard all these negative emotions so that I'm in enjoyment." That doesn't work. It's horrendous. It's just a recipe for shit stew.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):
Along these lines, how much of the work is learning to enjoy the thing you're doing more versus finding something that you innately enjoy? Which one is more powerful? I guess, which do you point people to? Which experiments do you find people should run more?

Joe Hudson (00:43:31):
In our society, typically, it's how to enjoy what you're doing more. What happens typically is that if you find a way to enjoy the thing that you're doing more, you're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. It's just an order of operations thing. As compared to there's people, a lot of the people in my circles because of who I coach and everything, they're billionaires and they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange life that they enjoy and it doesn't fucking work. They actually have more power to make everything that they're doing exactly what they want to do, but that doesn't work. Flying the jet or buying the island or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, doesn't do it.

(00:44:25):
Whereas if you really learn to enjoy what's in front of you, all of a sudden, one thing that happens is that you're not as scared of enjoyment. You start saying, "Oh, wow, enjoyment makes me really effective, and so I'm want to do the things that I enjoy." You're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. Instead of having this story, I have to do X, Y, and Z so that at one point in the future, I can do what I enjoy. It's just an order of operations things. If you learn to enjoy the things that you're doing, you're going to naturally start doing the things you enjoy. If you only do the things you enjoy, you will not learn how to enjoy what you're doing very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:03):
You show this tip of how can I enjoy this 10% more? Just ask yourself, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:09):
Yes, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
Is there anything else that you find helpful for helping? Yeah, right now, how can I enjoy this 10% right now?

Joe Hudson (00:45:14):
That's right. It's not about changing anything in the external world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):
Got it. Internally, what can I do? What can I change about the way I'm experiencing this?

Joe Hudson (00:45:23):
Yeah. I like to ask it as how do you enjoy it 10% more, because if it's what can I change, then there's trying, trying is usually not more enjoyment. It's actually usually letting go of trying that creates more enjoyment. The phrasing can really make or break the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):
Enjoy it 10% more. Say someone's sitting in a boring meeting that's really sucking their soul, look, they should ask themselves this question, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:51):
Well, should, they can. They get to, it's a great experiment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:54):
It's an experiment. Okay, perfect.

Joe Hudson (00:45:58):
The reason I do the should thing is that as soon as you say you should and then you don't then you can fail. If you fail, then you're less likely to try it again. That's why the should, it ends up usually in stagnation. If you think about the way it feels in your body when you say, I should do something, and there's a stagnation, there's a, hmm. whereas if you say something like, oh, I want to do it, or here's an experiment I can do, or here's what I enjoy, there's less stagnation, there's more movement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:31):
This touches on something else that you talk a lot about, and we've been circling around this idea of authenticity versus improvement, where you help people realize that you are good as you are, you don't need to necessarily improve. We've talked a lot about these sorts of things already, but just what else can you share there just how to help people learn this?

Joe Hudson (00:46:49):
My favorite metaphor on this one is at what time in the journey of an oak tree is it perfect? Is it when it's an acorn, when it's sprout, when it's 20 years old, 40 years old, 150 years old, 200 years old, depending on the oak tree? Now, I'm perfect. The idea is ridiculous. It's a similar thing for us. The idea that I need to improve myself, it really disturbs the natural process that's at hand, which is we evolve. We as human beings evolve. If it's like, oh, I'm evolving and I can enjoy it, and I'm acting from my authenticity, then that has a lot of alacrity. That moves quick. If it's I need to improve, there's something wrong with me, I need to improve, I should do it, that all goes really fucking slow. Because there's a lot of emotional stagnation in that.

(00:47:55):
There's a lot of should shame. There's a lot of stagnation in that, and so you don't actually get that natural flow of life. The Taoist talk about this as kind of like a river always finds its way, it just always goes in that direction. We are naturally evolving. That is our nature. Then to put a whole bunch of shoulds and shits in the way just slows the process down. The other thing about authenticity that I think is really important too, is that if you are one of the few people, I'd say 10, 15%, who can say, I should be this way, this way, and this way, and then you do it, which is very few people can actually do that. What most people do is they say, I should do this, should do that, should do that, and then a decade later, they're still saying they should do the same things. Let's say you're one of those really successful people, then you have a life for not you. Then you have a life of who you think you should be, not for who you actually are.

(00:49:02):
If you move from authenticity, naturally, certain things aren't going to work, certain things are going to work. Certain people are going to work, certain people aren't going to work. Certain jobs are going to work. The ones that you end up with over time are going to be the ones that are right for you, not right, for who you think you should be. The most obvious of this is you meet a woman and you're like, oh, this is how I should be for them to love me, and you just do it. You just do everything that you think you should do, and then you get married, and then they love not you, they love who you think you should be. They don't love who you are. What kind of marriage is that? As opposed to, this is who I am and I'm going to be as genuine. I'm going to show you all my parts. I'm going to be as genuine as I can with you. Then if you do get married, you're married to the right person, you're married to the person who actually sees all that and loves that and wants that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:01):
How do you hold that idea with I also want to get better, I want to develop myself, I want to feel my emotions more, those sorts of things?

Joe Hudson (00:50:10):
I love that I want to, the better part is kind of just, gets a little bit in the way. We all want to, like a little kid wants to run faster. They might want to be a better runner, but the part that they missed, the reason that they develop so fucking quickly is because they don't think they're going to be a better person if they run faster. The idea is like, yeah, you have this natural want, that want is the thing that moves evolution. A plant is like, "Oh, there's sun. I want to move in that direction." As compared to I should. Both of them are human concepts, but the want, it's the thing that what allows us to know that's our evolutionary path. Oh, I have this want to be closer to people. Oh, I have this want for great sex. Oh, I have this want for being able to have a business that supports me.

(00:51:07):
These are great wants, and they show where the growth is occurring or wants to occur. It's like that's our natural evolution. It's great. What makes it need to be better? I want to be better. It just slows it down instead of, it's like saying that what I am is broken and therefore, the whole thing slows down. We try to word everything as more in the experimental framework, but also, we try to word everything as self-awareness, self-experimentation, self-discovery, instead of self-improvement. Because if you understand the problem, then the problem goes away. Just explore it. Just understand it as compared to making a list of things that you should do to get better, that you will eventually fail and then you'll just be stuck in this should loop where you beat yourself up and where most people hang out a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):
The experiment here that I'm taking away is think more about your want versus the should, and then things you think you need is okay.

Joe Hudson (00:52:20):
Because typically, when you say, I want to improve, it means the subtext in that is once I do X, Y, and Z, then I'm lovable. Once I do X, Y and Z, then I'm okay. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be worthy. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be enlightened, whatever the fuck, the thing is. That's just not how it works. What works is the person who loves themselves has loving relationships. It's not the person who's done X, Y, and Z so that they can be lovable, has loving relationships. The people who do X, Y and Z, so they can be lovable have relationships where people are critical and constantly telling them that they have to be better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:01):
Coming back, you just said this interesting quote that you also shared at the beginning. This idea, once we understand the problem, it goes away.

Joe Hudson (00:53:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):
Let's make sure people understand what that means. Is it related to this idea once you feel like I'm an asshole, okay, and then like, oh, okay, and then it starts to kind of away, is that the core?

Joe Hudson (00:53:15):
I just mean practically. It's like, can you really fully understand a problem if you don't understand the solution to it? There's a principle, and I can't remember the name of it, like it's Strickland principle or something. It's something that this CFO that I used to work with said, and he would say, "Problems get solved if you spend time on them. If you just give enough attention to a problem, the problem will solve." That's the way it works in business. An unsolvable problem, obviously, it's not going to work that way. The reason that, that works is because the more you spend time on a problem, the more you understand it.

(00:53:58):
Another one, love him or hate him, one of the things that Elon Musk has said that I found it very valuable in my time, is that if you really want to interview somebody and they claim that they've done something, you ask them six levels down. You improved sales. How did you do that, exactly? Well, we improved the pipeline. How'd you do that, exactly? Oh, well, we made the pipeline more measurable by having things that could be. How did you know? What were the seven stages of the pipeline and what made you pick them? You go six levels down and you can really understand if somebody was the person who solved the problem or if they're the person who is claiming that they solved the problem. It's the same thing.

(00:54:47):
If we just explore a problem enough, the solution is apparent. If we understand the problem enough, the solution is apparent. Typically, if we come to a problem with a kid's mind, wonder, if we come to it, what could I learn here? What's exciting? What are the experiments I can run? Then typically, that's the most efficient way, enjoyable way to solve a problem as compared to, I have to get to this problem by this time and we're going to do it this way. Usually, that doesn't work. I could geek out on why that lets democracies win over autocracies because they're far more experimental by nature, and it's not one person saying how things are going, but just generally, just we're more efficient when we're exploring. We're more efficient when we're exploring ourselves and understanding ourselves and trying to improve ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:46):
There's a couple of more experiments I want to help people try to run. One is you have some really good advice around decision-making and how emotions and getting better at understanding and working with your emotions helps you make better decisions. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:55:59):
That's similar to what I said before, which is if you learn to fall in love with the emotional experiences, then you have more solution sets. Let's say I want to have all human beings, I want to be a part of a great team. Nobody has ever raised their hand and said, "I'd like to be a part of a team." Yet, grand majority of people at their work right now have shitty teams or not A teams, not great teams, even though nobody wants that. If one of the things you're unwilling to feel is that conflict, that tension, as we talked about if you're conflict avoidant, you're not going to be able to make an A team because there's nothing that is alive doesn't require tension. A cell requires tension. Breathing requires tension. Playing pickleball requires tension. A good team requires tension. If you're going to avoid that experience, you're not going to be as easily, if at all, be able to create a quality team.

(00:57:05):
To be able to look forward to any emotional experience, creates more and more solution sets for more and more optionality. In creating a great team, for instance, you need to be good with people hating you. You need to be good with drawing boundaries and having people upset. You need to be able to have high expectations. You have to be okay with somebody being disappointed with themselves. You have to be okay being disappointed with yourself. All these emotional experiences have to be available to you if you're going to find the solutions to make an A quality team. The more you can fall in love with each emotional experience, the more you have and then the clearer the decision making gets. That's one thing for making great decisions. The other one that I find really, really useful and very hard to execute on until you really understand it is creating a set of principles to live by.

(00:58:06):
We all have a set of principles to live by that we're doing it. For a lot of people, those principles are what do I have to do to get likes on Facebook? I'm going to make a decision based on getting likes on Facebook. I'm going to make decisions based on whatever it is. Pretending that I want to get wealthy or trying to get wealthy or there's a series of things. If you really take a look at what it is you're making your decisions on and then really think about, well, what would be the five or six things that if I made decisions with these principles, I'm guaranteed success? Then experiment with them and then refine those principles and then experiment with them. Then there'll be these moments where you don't want to do it, but those are your principles, so you're going to go and do it.

(00:59:03):
As an example for this, one of the principles that I live by is embrace intensity. It's not create intensity, it's embrace intensity. It means that right now, any moment in my body, for instance, there's going to be a sensation that's more intense. How do I welcome that sensation? At any moment in running my business, there's going to be something that we don't want to talk about. How do we lean in and talk about that? We start all of our meetings with what are you scared to say in our business? What are you scared to say? Not all of our meetings, but some of our meetings are started with what are you scared to say? Because we want to embrace that intensity because we know that if we lean into the thing that we're trying to avoid, our life is going to get better, our business is going to get better.

(00:59:57):
If you can see what those principles are for you, and then run experiments to see if they work and then refine them every once in a while. Because of that embrace intensity, if somebody comes to me and says, "You're fucking up this business. You're doing it all wrong." I don't have to think about what I'm going to do. I'm like, "Oh, cool. Tell me what I'm missing." It's going to be immediate because I live this way. Maybe I don't want to hear it. Maybe I'm having a bad day. Whatever it is. Maybe I'll say, "Hey, I want hear you give me, I'm not able to, give me a day and I'll come back to you." all of a sudden, my decisions get made automatically if I live by a set of principles and very effective, I find very effective living by a set of principles

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:51):
For someone that wants to create their own set of principles. Is there a guide you have? Is there any advice for how to actually go about starting this list, putting it together?

Joe Hudson (01:00:58):
We have a decisions course, which is a large part of it is about how to do that. It's a difficult one to explain because there's a lot of nuance in it. Just as for instance, one of the nuances is defining the principles, not just by what it is, but what it isn't is a really significant, very minor thing, but it ends up being incredibly major. If you're going to do your set of principles and you want to do them on your own, the main thing I would say is keep it to five. I wouldn't even do six. I don't do six, but I keep it to five. I would test each one of them for five days.

(01:01:39):
Make your principle and then see if it works for you for five days and then keep on experimenting until you find five. When you look at those five and you say, "If I do that, if I live by those principles, I am just almost a hundred, if not a hundred percent confident that, that's going to create the life I want if I live by those principles." Then you have a really good start and make them simple. Mine are things like embrace intensity or connection first or everything is in iteration. As soon as I live by them, things work, company works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:20):
Amazing. We'll point folks to that course if they want to take it themselves. Cool.

Joe Hudson (01:02:25):
It's only once a year, so it's a rare one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):
Oh, wow. When is the next one?

Joe Hudson (01:02:29):
January.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):
Okay. Not too far away for folks to want to wait. Again, the two pieces of advice you shared, and that's our experiments that we can run to help become better decision makers. One is create a list of life principles, and there's a course that will point people to, to take that. The other is the thing you keep coming back to over and over and over, this idea of falling in love with your emotions, embracing your emotions, welcoming your emotions. There's also, I know you do a lot of work with teams. I imagine there's very similar advice for how to help your team be more effective. Principles, I imagine is a part of it, falling in love.

Joe Hudson (01:03:02):
We've run principles for teams, yeah. That's one of them. Teams would be more effective. We have a lot of, I mean I think I have, at this point, I have 12 things that I'll go into a company and do with a company. Typically, the way I like to do it is I will go in and I'll talk to the leader typically and they'll say, "This is what I want." Then I really want to assess. Typically, if the person who is a big part of creating the problem has a hard time seeing the way through the problem, or it wouldn't have been created generally. This is not demeaning any leader, we all have these issues. Usually, what I like to do is I like to go in and I like to talk to three or four people, see what their perspective, not just the leader's perspective.

(01:03:57):
Then I like to sit in a meeting or two and just see actually what the dynamic is. One of the things I like to say about how to change a company is that the atomic structure of a company is the meetings and the decisions. It's particularly true in Silicon Valley, but it's really true in all businesses that all we are as a company is a group of people's relationships and ideas. Especially, like Amazon, you got a couple of buildings and some servers. There's not a lot of hardware there, and they wouldn't be useful without the people anyways. Anybody, whether you're running a farm or a shoe factory or anybody's successful is going to tell you it's all about the people. The atomic structure is what are our meetings like and how do we make decisions? I'll just really pay attention to a meeting. One of the things we do is we talk about what we call five-star meetings, which is how do you make every meeting enjoyable?

(01:05:04):
Literally, how is it that everybody when they walk out of a meeting, they're like, oh, fuck, that was great? It turns out, we've all been in meetings that are hard as shit, and we've walked out and gone, oh, those are great meetings. We've all been in meetings where nothing happens and we're like, "Oh, God. Fuck, another one to just drive a nail through my head. I don't want to sit there." What's required to make one of your meetings five stars? If you do that, that's one of the things we'll do inside of a company is work with them to figure that out. If you do that, every single problem with your company will come to the surface. Every single one of them. I had ten five -tar meetings, but these two meetings sucked. That tells me exactly where we need to focus as a company.

(01:05:53):
That tells me exactly where to look for the problem that's happening. It's the same thing with decisions. If you really start unpacking how the decisions are made where people are frustrated in the decision-making process, you're going to find exactly the problems in the company. An example of this, I was working with a friend and he's a content person, and we were just talking about how do you make every one of your meetings a five-star meeting? He's like, "Okay, great." He's like, "Yeah, I'm never going to do this." I was like, "Really? Tell me why." He's, "My YouTube meetings fucking suck." That's not where he makes most of his money, but these YouTube meetings suck. They're never going to get better.

(01:06:39):
Luckily, there's a couple other people around at the time and everyone's like, "No, wait, I love my YouTube meetings. What do you mean? How could this not work for you?" He noticed, oh, the team didn't, the content, none of it was working for him. None of it was him. He was just like, "Ugh." He changed it. He was like, "Okay, I'm going to commit to that. I'm going to see what it's like for me to just say every one of my YouTube meetings have to be something that's super enjoyable to me." When he did it, his YouTube numbers went off the charts in a very short period of time. It's just that common. Wherever the meeting is that sucks, it means there's something else that's a problem that needs to be worked on. That's typically how. I can just look at, usually sit in any team meeting and see at least three or four of the major problems that are happening in the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):
Such a cool way of thinking about where to focus decision-making meetings. I love that the story comes back to something you shared earlier with the more you enjoy something, the more joy there is, the better it's going to go anyway. The more you can find those moments and make things enjoyable, the better.

Joe Hudson (01:07:45):
The other cool thing is most of the executives or the CEOs that I've worked with, when they get to a point, and it usually takes them like, we always have the goal of a month, it usually takes two months to make sure every one of their meetings is five-star meetings. Once they've done that, then it's like, how do you make sure all of your teams have five-star meetings? Usually, it's like within two months and they usually have half the amount of meetings at the end of it. Half the amount of meetings in their companies are more effective. It's an incredible tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
I could see why people enjoy that if you were meeting as well. Is there anything more along those lines before we start to close out our conversation, either around teams or decision-making?

Joe Hudson (01:08:30):
I'll say for anybody who's running a team, Harvard has got a couple of these, but we used to do these tiny pulses. As a VC, one of the strategies that was really effective that I saw very few VCs doing was I would want these pulse, I would like to read the pulse of teams with these short surveys and stuff. It was the most effective way of not very happy, didn't want to come to work on Monday. They weren't going to make their numbers. The likelihood of them making their numbers is going down. There was this interesting thing that just about how Drucker, I think said it first and then the Virgin guy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
Branson?

Joe Hudson (01:09:16):
Branson said it. He's like, "Culture eats strategy for breakfast," or some such. If that's true, then it's measurable and it can be a leading indicator, and it absolutely is. If you really pay attention to the culture on a team-by-team basis, it's an amazing, very effective way to drive results, but also, a very effective way to know when bad results are coming. What's interesting to me is most people feel like they can't control the culture, like most people feel like.

(01:09:52):
Most people, I notice, they feel like, it's more likely for me to hear from a CEO, "God damn it, everybody agrees when I get out of the table. When I get off the table, everyone's like, yeah, we're going to do it. Then they don't do it. Why aren't they doing it?" I'm going to hear that more often than I'm going to hear a CEO say, "Oh, wow. I really noticed that the way the email system was working in our company, we were disempowering people by not requiring an action after every..." I'm going to hear more complaints about why shit isn't working than I'm going to hear about strategies, like very gentle, simple strategies to change the culture. it's an amazing thing to me that it's so powerful and yet people feel so out of control with it

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
To give people something they can do, say today or tomorrow to work on a lot of these things we've been talking about. Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone should try to experiment with in the next day, couple of days or weeks, just to help them be better and more successful and happier?

Joe Hudson (01:11:00):
I would do seven minutes, no less than seven minutes. You can do more than seven minutes. Seven minutes of gratitude with another person every day. It can't be, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this. It has to be feeling the gratitude and then seeing what comes out of your mouth when you're coming from the felt sense of gratitude and doing it back and forth. You're savoring the experience of gratitude and you're going back and forth with another human being. Call mom, dad, sister, brother, business partner, friend, and every day just express gratitude back and forth for seven minutes, coming from the feeling, not from the thought. If you have a full body sensation of gratitude and you experience that for seven minutes a day, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly. Really, really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):
Wow. I already feel it. The practice is you are expressing gratitude to the person you're with.

Joe Hudson (01:12:09):
It can be gratitude for anything in your life. As a matter of fact, I would say do it for a couple of weeks and then do it on the places where you feel lack. That's where the superpower comes in. In my own personal life, I was meditating. I spent seven, eight hours a day meditating for years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):
That's a lot of hours.

Joe Hudson (01:12:32):
You can imagine, I didn't have a lot of money. The joke I used to make is I would meditate and worry about money most of my day. It's funny, but it's truth. One day, I was thinking about money and thinking I was driving in my car and I was thinking about this billionaire I knew and I was thinking about how I didn't have enough and then I thought, "Oh, this billionaire doesn't think they have enough either. I know I'm well enough." I'm like, "Oh, I have the experience of a billionaire right now." I was like, "He's probably driving in a car somewhere thinking he doesn't have enough, and I'm driving in a car somewhere thinking I don't have enough. This is great. I'm a billionaire."

(01:13:20):
It tickled me, the idea tickled me. Then I was like, well, what happens if I start focusing on everything I do have instead of focusing on what I don't have? Which is where the gratitude practice came from. My wife and I would sit every day and just be grateful for all the physical stuff that we had. We were living in a hobble, were living 15-year-old year cars. We had no money. I was in debt. I was in, I think $40,000 in credit card debt or some crazy shit. We just did it. Literally, was it three months later, my credit card debt was gone. Six months later, I had $60,000 in the bank. Entire life changed because I no longer defined myself by somebody who didn't have, I defined myself as somebody who did have. All of a sudden, I could look out the window and it wasn't, "Oh, shit, I can't have that. I can't have that. I can't have that."

(01:14:18):
I look out the window, I'd say somebody made money on that. Somebody made money on that. Every fucking thing I looked at, somebody made money on. 20 people, 20 companies made money on the fucking lamppost. The person who installed it, the energy company, the rubber company, there's just, holy crap, it's all over the place. Then in that definition, all of a sudden, it became really clear. It doesn't matter if the thing that you feel like you lack is time, or the thing that you feel like you lack is love or the thing that you feel like you lack is money. If you can really do a gratitude practice on the thing that you lack, there's a superpower in that one, changes everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
Do you still do this?

Joe Hudson (01:15:00):
I do gratitude, yes. Do I do gratitude on stuff I lack? I don't really have an experience of lack. That's not really...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:07):
You still do this gratitude, seven minutes?

Joe Hudson (01:15:09):
Of course, yes. That's like asking if I still have sex. Why would I give that up? It feels great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:16):
Just to be clear, you find someone seven minutes every morning, probably think about things you're grateful for and share back. Focus not on your intellectual thing you're grateful for, but just what's coming out of your emotional body.

Joe Hudson (01:15:28):
Feel the gratitude.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:30):
Yeah, then gratitude.

Joe Hudson (01:15:30):
Let the feeling of gratitude speak rather than your mind, so that you get the felt sense of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Joe, I'm incredibly grateful for you. I really appreciate you sharing so many experiments for people to run. I think this is going to make a real impact on a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find your courses? I know you have a podcast. Where can folks find the stuff they do online, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:15:55):
First of all, Art of Accomplishment, the podcast, it's Art of Accomplishment with Brett Kistler and Joe Hudson, I think. Then Art of Accomplishment, the website will show you where all the courses are. It'll give you a whole bunch of experiments you can run. There's all sorts of really great information there. The other thing that we just mentioned also is just that we really want to make sure that you think that the courses are for you. The way we do courses is that it's a very felt experience thing. It's not intellectual at all. It's really in your body. The way we like doing it is that you bring real problems that you're having and you use the tools that we teach you. The foundational course for that is called the Connection Course. If you want to get into it, go to the Connection Course.

(01:16:45):
To find out if it's right for you, if you're not already know that it's right for you, we do these little hour and a half free workshops and it'll give you a taste of what it is that we do because it's like anything that's going on out there. It's people doing, they're like, "What the hell was that?" It's just a completely different thing. It's not like learning in the normal way. You literally sit down with another person and run experiments face-to-face with how you're being in the moment. You learn all this stuff through direct experimentation. If you find out it's right for you, you can do it through these workshops, and I'm sure there'll be a place where they can find out where to go for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
There's one coming up in September, I believe.

Joe Hudson (01:17:30):
The Connection Course is coming up in September. It's a great place to start. It's foundational for everything else we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):
Then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:17:39):
I want my children to grow up in a fantastic world. The best way that, that can happen is that if the people listening to this discover who they are and their nature and the truth of how they operate. Not for them, but for their children and their children's children. You want to do me a favor and make my daughter's world a better place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:08):
I also just had a son, and so I totally resonate with that.

Joe Hudson (01:18:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:13):

# What differentiates the highest-performing product teams | John Cutler (The Beautiful Mess)

## Transcript

John Cutler (00:00:00):
Let's say you're a founder and you're trying to decide, should I invest more on processes, or should I invest more in people. The first thing is introspection. What do you believe in, really? What do you believe in, and what do the people around you believe in, and how can you be a coherent leader? And you know what? You can nudge yourself a little bit away from your happy plate, but you're not going to go super far. You're not going to go from like a process-driven meritocratic, X, Y, Z person all the way to like I'm going to start a collectivist company where everything is sort of a consensus decision to do that. You're not going to do that. But I think it starts with self-awareness and then that's how people form their authentic leadership vibe, and then they flex a little bit and then they embrace other perspectives.

Lenny (00:00:49):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is John Cutler. John is one of the most prolific, beloved, and longtime writers and sharers of product wisdom online, and as you'll hear at the start of this episode, thanks to his really unique role at Amplitude, he's worked with a large percentage of product teams and product managers around the world. I've learned a lot from John's writings over the years and share his stuff often, and so it was a real honor to chat in depth with John. I anticipated this would happen and it happened, this ended up being the longest episode I've done yet, and honestly, we could have kept going for a lot longer.

(00:01:35):
We chat about what differentiates the highest performing product teams from less well performing product teams, what it takes to create real change within a company, why you should be skeptical of frameworks and tools that you read about online, why all underperforming teams fail in similar ways but high performing teams succeed in many different ways, and so much more. I am confident you will love this episode and I cannot wait for you to hear it. With that, I bring you John Cutler after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:05):

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics, and then set you to North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments, and Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine-learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com, and 10 x your experiment velocity.

(00:04:18):
John Cutler, welcome to the podcast.

John Cutler (00:04:21):
Yeah, thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:23):
I kind of know you as John Cutler. I feel weird to call you just John. Do you find that to be true, and also do people call you John Cuttlefish because of your Twitter handle?

John Cutler (00:04:32):
Yeah, John Cuttlefish. There is this, I learned yesterday, there's a DJ, a famous DJ called Jon Cutler without the H, so I don't know if are people into house music knew that. Yeah, I think usually it just, like most Johns, it forms into Cutler or JC or something like that, but just John is good, yeah, for now, or Cuttlefish, you could just call me Cuttlefish. That'd be fine.

Lenny (00:04:51):
You said that actually, we were talking before this, you said you do some music, so is that DJ actually you?

John Cutler (00:04:57):
No, but that would be really funny. In fact, the person yesterday who reached out over Twitter said, "Dude, I don't know what you're doing now in your career, but I really like your earlier work." But that would've been pretty cool to be Jon Cutler, the DJ. I wrote songs and played rock music and stuff, not like a house DJ.

Lenny (00:05:15):
Okay, this could be the next phase of your career which we'll talk a bit about. But let me just say that I'm so incredibly excited for this conversation. I've been hoping to do this for a long time, and now that you're between gigs, we finally found an opportunity to do this, and I just have a feeling this is going to be one of the longest episodes we've done because there's so much I want to ask you, and there's so much interesting stuff that you've had access to and that I think that you can share. So, I hope you're ready for potentially a marathon of an episode.

John Cutler (00:05:40):
Sure, yeah, I'm ready. This is exciting. I'm on vacation now between jobs, so this is the highlight of my day. We can go all day if you want.

Lenny (00:05:47):
All right. Eight hours. Let's do it.

John Cutler (00:05:49):
Terrific.

Lenny (00:05:50):
So, I was thinking that we start with a little bit about this unique role that you had at Amplitude which you just left after about four years, and what's most interesting about it is it give you access to an incredible number of product teams and product managers, unlike anything else I've seen or any other role I've seen before. So, could you just talk a little bit about this role that you had at Amplitude, and what it was like to work with so many product teams and so many product managers?

John Cutler (00:06:16):
Yeah, absolutely. So, first off, I remember almost specifically the day that Sandhya from Amplitude reached out and was sort of floated this idea of this role to me, and I'm so grateful for Sandhya, and Justin, Matt Althauser, Spencer, the whole team, because it was really, it was really kind of a weird role from the beginning. They were starting to get more and more customers who were not traditional startups or kind of growth stage startups showing up, and they needed to figure out how to convey expertise and convey things to the broader product public in a way that would land with those companies, right? I guess, kudos to them thinking this weird idea could work. So, I'm really, really grateful for that.

(00:07:06):
But yeah, my official title was product evangelist. I don't think that I super fit that role, but that was the title that we had, and basically my job was to wake up every morning and do things that would overlap Amplitude the product, but then help uplevel our customers, sort of uplevel the broader product community. I call them current customers and future customers. That's how I woke up every day, I'm either talking to a current customer, I'm talking to a future customer. This product transformation's happening all around the world, just means it's a matter of time, eventually they'll become Amplitude customers, so I should just try to make them awesome and try to help them with different expertise.

(00:07:46):
But my day-to-day was spent a lot advocating for different ways of working, doing coaching, doing workshops. I wrote the North Star Playbook in partnership with Jason who was a co-writer with that. We did a lot of one-to-one coaching sessions. I had these things called product therapy sessions when I would just wake up in the morning and just kind of soak in whatever problem people were having for the day. I did meet with hundreds and hundreds of people and did workshops for thousands and thousands of people and talks for more than that, tens of thousands, really, in terms of the talks. So, it was just a, yeah, crazy experience doing that. So, the technical details is I predominantly reported into marketing and product marketing, and then I did a stint actually where I was on our product team as we were sort of getting our education efforts going, ultimately we moved that over to customer success, and I went back to marketing. So, that's the technical side of it, I reported into marketing.

(00:08:45):
But I do remember the day I arrived and probably a couple weeks later, we had our all hands annual kickoff, and there was a big presentation about our goal being the trusted expert, and that still resonates with me the whole time I was there that an evangelist is there to help uplevel the world with trusted expertise, and in a product like analytics product, there's the product analytics, but then there's whole other ways of working that overlap that. So, yeah, generally that was my role. It kind of is a crazy role, for sure.

Lenny (00:09:16):
That is wild. You're basically like a free product coach for product team. You just come in, help them uplevel the way they build product, and then Amplitude becomes... You need to figure out how to work with data, Amplitude can help you be more data informed. I imagine that's kind of the general idea.

John Cutler (00:09:30):
Yeah, it's funny, I joke with our professional services team. I mean, so if you're a SaaS company, I think sometimes you have a professional services team. At Amplitude, especially the way that we saw that is companies put money in and that sort of creates skin in the game. They're really paying you less for the professional services and more for the accountability and the access to the expertise. So, I would joke with Jenna from that team that maybe we should have monetized all these workshops. I know Gibb and other people, they're charging a good chunk for North Star workshops and here we were just kind of doing them for free.

(00:10:04):
So, ultimately, maybe there was another strategy there, but that we did those generally for free, and sometimes I kind of stuck my foot in it. In the middle of the pandemic at one point we were like, "What are we going to do? We can't travel for workshops." And I would put in my newsletter, "Hey, anyone want a workshop?" And then suddenly, our sales team, we had to grapple with what are we going to do with these 120 leads, how are we going to work with them. It was funny having to deal with it.

(00:10:32):
But yeah, in general, this is a unique role. I would definitely consider a SaaS company's think about a role like this, but it's really nuanced. We can share some links later as I reflected on what we did right and wrong, but ultimately, I think you shouldn't rely on individual people. You should think of evangelists as almost like concentric circles of your community and some people who just happen to have more expertise. Look, our internal team's amazing, Ibrahim, Justin, and Abbie, and when Sandhya was at the company, and just, everyone's an advocate. Everyone's a potential evangelist. It's just that there's only so many hours in the day. So, you could think of your community as just these concentric circles of evangelists and advocates. It's just like how you design it right that does it. So, yeah, recommended. It's a little tricky, but yeah, it was a cool move to do.

Lenny (00:11:19):
That sounds like a future post, how to do this in a different way where they don't have a John Cutler in place. You said you worked with hundreds of teams. Maybe just give us some numbers roughly of how many companies have you worked with, how many product managers do you think you've spoken to in this career.

John Cutler (00:11:32):
Oh geez.

Lenny (00:11:33):
This phase of your career.

John Cutler (00:11:34):
So, I think I did it... There might have been over the four years, maybe 800 one-on-ones, individual leader one-on-ones. I'm thinking it was at the peak, it was in one year's 150 workshops and then overlapped in the next year, then between 200, but mostly the average maybe let's say three or 400 workshops, a hundred a year. It's heavy. And then there was these just general conference talks and other things that we're doing. I tried to total, I exported all my Google Calendar invites, I tried to categorize all them at some point, but really also you have to think about it is that what we did with the North Star Playbook, it was truly a team effort at Amplitude.

(00:12:19):
We started to have our, I think it was Sandhya who needed to like, we had three days to go in to close a customer and they were looking for us for trusted expertise, and she pulled together this workshop and she came up with these three games of product which is a really tricky and cool way to describe how your North Star inputs and North Star should be, and it started this ball rolling, and then they wrote a blog post about it.

(00:12:42):
So, if you search North Star, you get to Sandhya's post. It's an amazing post, and then our CSM started to learn how to do it, and then we were like, "We should write a playbook for it." And then it got to the point where if you go on LinkedIn, people are like, "We used," and I made a whole point of saying we did not invent this thing, but people will say, "We use Amplitude's North Star framework," and I have to always chime in, like, "No, we did not invent that thing. You should go to Sean or you should go to any of these people who've done it in the past." But yeah, the whole point is that a lot of this stuff was evolved over time. It wasn't just some snap marketing campaign to do it.

(00:13:17):
Same thing are our retention playbooks and engagement playbooks. When I arrived at Amplitude, people would send pictures of those playbooks sitting on their desks and people thought, "Oh, it's just this piece of marketing content. How did they pull it together?" I did some research and our CS team developed 110-page bulk of research from working directly with customers around retention engagement, then we had a PM and a great content writer, Archana, zero in and kind of make it palatable, then we did ARC for it. So, it didn't just magically appear. People think that these artifacts that Amplitude has just magically appeared, but they were just... It's a company filled with passionate experts of these things, and it was like tested, iterated, tested, iterated, expanded, tested, put into motion, put into practice, and that's how you create these kind of franchise cornerstone pieces of content for your company. You don't just snap your fingers one day. So, anyway, I wanted to point that out. Huge group effort for all these things.

Lenny (00:14:22):
How does it feel to have left Amplitude at this point? I imagine you're going through some rollercoaster emotions.

John Cutler (00:14:26):
Oh geez. Well, the immense amount of gratitude, definitely, mention that, wonderful people, wonderful customers. Just imagine like if you're a product nerd, one day you're with Amazon, one day you're with Ikea, one day you're with LEGO, one day you're with Intercom, then you're with a two-person startup, and then you're with Figma. So, really, once in a lifetime experience to be able to do that. In fact, if I had been a paid consultant, I never would've been able to do that. Another thing too is that there's this sort of selection bias. If you're a consultant, people come to you to work with you, but often I just had to talk to whatever team wanted access to expertise at Amplitude, not necessarily me. So, I didn't get to dictate A lot of times the conversation. It's like, shit, I'm not doing a very good job here. This person thinks in a very different way to do that.

(00:15:18):
So, yeah, a lot of gratitude. I would say it got really heavy a lot in the sense that my son was born, three months later, I start the job, and then the pandemic kicks in, and every day you're absorbing just attention from teams. You're meeting leaders who are about to leave. Five days later, you're meeting people who are trying to save their team from the pandemic, imploding everything they're doing. Yeah, I'm joke about the product therapy thing, but I would finish the day at 2:00 or 3:00 and then have to do another one. Wake up at 5:00 to do an EMEA workshop, 5:00 to 7:00, be two in workshop, then take a break, then do another two-hour workshop, and then talk to a leader about how everything was going to explode, and then another leader. And then I was still on a team in Amplitude, so I might go to my own meeting where we're working through our own challenges, and then it's 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon. I'm done. Oh, to be able to do that.

(00:16:16):
And then I think it also left me with a couple key lessons we could probably go into later when we're doing it. One, you are talking to a bunch of different companies, achieving the almost similar results in very, very different ways. They behave in different ways, the context in the pandemic or the economy. You would see the pandemic kick in and then you would talk to 50 companies that were dealing with the ramifications of it. So, it's kind of funny, I joked with someone at Amplitude, they're like, "We were going through our own shit," and I'm like, "Yeah, and I've seen how 50 other companies are going through their own shit," where this is you're doing it. So, the power of context.

(00:16:52):
The regional differences were so fascinating. I was on with a teen that was based in India and just the passion and curiosity. There was not one jaded person in the room. There was not one person like, "Been there, done that. When's the performance review cycle ending?" or anything like that. It was just all-out passion and hunger for information. So, those days were amazing. So, yeah, you talk a lot about it, but it definitely, it feels like a relief in some ways because the amount of tension to do it. And so, for my next plan actually what I'm doing is I'm going to work at Toast in a couple weeks, and I've been in touch with a leader there, Craig Daniel, for a long time, kind of really liked what he did at Drift.

(00:17:40):
But I think that what I realized over the course of these four years is that I wanted to pivot back to help put most of my energy into helping my own company. They're growing super fast, so the numbers are in the hundreds of everything or in the thousands of everything, and they're not just the POS business. They've got these different businesses, like guest services and back office stuff and things. Amplitude is a super horizontal, if you think about it, it's almost like a diagonal, and so it made your head spin, and I kind of wanted to go back to a vertical SaaS. There's a company here in Santa Barbara called AppFolio that I like working at, and I really had a soft spot for vertical SaaS, but I'm thinking put my energy into an internal team for a little bit to pivot back into that. And so, I'll be helping enable product teams and sort of doing what I was doing, but within a company as well. So, it's going to be an interesting shift.

Lenny (00:18:29):
You touched on so many topics that I want to dig further into, and you also talked about where you're heading next, which I was going to ask, so that's great. Thank you for covering all that. By the way, I was just going to also say, lucky Toast, wow, to get John Cutler. Go them.

John Cutler (00:18:42):
Oh, lucky me. I mean, Jesus, Toast is this gem. I just was joking with Craig the other day. I was like, "I did not know all that stuff was going on at Toast."

Lenny (00:18:52):
Awesome. Okay. So, before we dig into some of the stuff that you brought up like cultural differences between companies, what the best teams are doing differently, things like that, I actually, and you noticed, I asked on Twitter what I should ask you. You have a lot of fans on Twitter and there's a ton of questions, and one actually got pretty spicy and I want to touch on it briefly. This guy, Jason Cohen pointed out that a lot of the stuff you share online in your newsletter and tweets and things like that, it often doesn't have a clear recommendation of here's what you should do or concrete piece of advice you could take away. It's kind of messy which is appropriate because your newsletter is called A Beautiful Mess. And so, my question to you is why have you found that you like to embrace the mess in your writing and your thinking and your advice?

John Cutler (00:19:38):
I was reflecting that the newsletter, it's almost like an emo band, The Beautiful Mess, it's so angsty. It couldn't have been more... If I had a band, I did not have an emo band when I was 16, but if I did, I would've called it The Beautiful Mess. So, it's probably pretty consistent with personality to do those things. I mean, I actually really appreciated Jason pointing that out, and in fact, at the end of this year, I put this post out to people saying, "Hey, here are things I'm grappling with, like the actionability of the content that I put out there, diversity of product advice, it's important to me," and then what it's like to just be a weirdo. We all have our weird freak things to do these things. And so, what does it mean to embrace those things? So, it was really timely I thought that Jason put that out there, and so maybe I'll give a little background about the newsletter and what I was looking for that.

(00:20:29):
And so, I think that the first thing that I did was four years ago, I kind of scanned the product advice landscape and I noticed three things. First, there's sort of three perspectives that pervaded, and again, I just want to make a huge caveat, this is not a judgment on any of these particular perspectives. It's more like I noticed a lot of it. And the first was that to be successful, number one, maybe success is tools, skills, mindset. So, that's kind of one group of particular things. The second that in terms of worldviews, we mentioned international worldviews too, but there was a high percentage of product advice that was kind of grounded where you think it would be grounded. So, it was grounded in this idea of meritocracy. Success is primarily about merit, very highly individualistic, and we don't realize that in the US until you do meetings with other teams, just how individualistic we can be when it comes to how we think about teams should be set up and stuff.

(00:21:28):
And then I think the third thing I realized was that it was very often very context free, and I mean that actually in the nicest way. It was optimized to make sure that it could be actionable, that someone could take that away. That's what I really like about the content that you put out there, and I like about a lot of the guests on the podcast. They kind of lay it out in those particular things. And so, to kind of go through, yeah, those tools, skills, mindset, that makes sense, right? Who does not want tools to be better? In fact, a lot of the podcasts I like, we can get into that later, are like, "We're going to give you the tools and tactics that the best people do." So, I really like that kind of stuff as well.

(00:22:04):
The second part of that is this idea of success be mostly about individual skills in jobs. So, this idea of great leaders, high performing teams, 10 x people, kind of go on and on. And then the product mindset stuff which is a little bit like you have it or you don't, or you develop or you don't. It's very mysterious. So, again, I'm going to go through these things and then think about how they inspire me. Part of me was like, "Okay, there's a lot of that stuff, but maybe not as much stuff kind of unraveling the dynamics that happen behind those things."

(00:22:36):
So, the meritocracy stuff and the individualism stuff, it's basically the people rise to the top, they try the hardest, they work the hardest, the best in companies employ them. There's top tier companies, there's second tier companies. So, there's this very hierarchical view, and as I started to also dig in more into the stuff in Amplitude, I was like, "Wait, there's something right and wrong about this at the same time, there's something true but not true at the same time." So, that's something that I wanted to be able to explore in doing it. And then the context free advice was obviously I noticed more and more that people trying to put tools in play out of context sometimes had worse effects than them just not doing it at all to do that.

(00:23:18):
So, anyway, I kind of thought about it as a product, like, "Okay, what's my opportunity here? There's a lot of this great advice. It's very actionable. I don't know. In the US were pretty individualistic, so the advice probably lands with people really, really well, and then also it's really actionable," and said, "Okay, well, what would be my particular angle?" So, I thought about the angle, about wanted to explore three things. I think the first one is this idea we do work in these complex adaptive systems, and so I really went deep in that particular area.

(00:23:47):
So, we work in environments. There's lots of things that are interdependent on each other. We don't work in closed systems. I mean, if you're in the Bay Area, you're in this broader system called the Bay Area that's in this broader system called California that's in this broader system called the United States. Your team is in a team of many, many teams in your company. The systems are non-linear. The bird flapping its wings in Brazil creates the tornado type of stuff. And so, I wanted to make sure that we got dug into that particular stuff in The Beautiful Mess stuff.

(00:24:21):
The next thing is that I'm a sucker for weird counterintuitive dynamics in companies. I don't know what it is. I absolutely love that. And so, maybe I'll give two examples. One, I'm obsessed with this idea of high work in progress, from a human level and a team level. How even though we know that if you try to do less at once, you'll be more effective, teams routinely just load themself up with work? And so, in the newsletter, I wanted to explore stuff like that, like why, when a bunch of people know irrationally that you should not load yourself up with work, why do really, really smart, capable, intelligent, passionate people in their personal lives and on their teams just load themself up with work? What are they optimizing about? So, that'd be like one example of counterintuitive stuff.

(00:25:09):
The other stuff is strategy stuff. Every company has these three pillars, and it seems really smart for the CEO to have this really clear three pillars, but then everyone walks away from the meeting and be like, "I don't know what we're with doing." That's another example of a counterintuitive thing. So, that was the second thing, the counterintuitive stuff. I love the complex stuff. And then frankly, I think the other thing is I just wanted to help people who are weird like me do those things. So, I would say I'm really, really triggered. People will say, "But it's probably triggered by Jason." He said, "Why? Bring solutions not just problems." That's my krypton, right? I like the systems thinking stuff. I like all that. So, anyway, long story short, wanted to help people like me. I like the complexity stuff. I like all these weird counterintuitive dynamics. And then I thought that there's a lot of representation for the very deterministic advice that people have.

Lenny (00:26:02):
That's a really good explanation. There-

John Cutler (00:26:00):
... advice that people have.

Lenny (00:26:02):
That's a really good explanation. There's a piece of what does the market want and let me deliver it, and then there's a piece of how is my brain working?

John Cutler (00:26:10):
I love the fact that people scan the market and say, "People want to know about prioritization and so I'm going to tell the world about prioritization." I really like that. In fact, I admire, I'm jealous of people who can produce that kind of content realistically. Interestingly enough, probably in my doodling in post I've probably given frameworks to do that. I just don't think too much about it. I just kind of go in these things. There's always this balance and one way that I think about is to get anything done, we need to reduce the world a little bit. That's the difference.

(00:26:41):
Back to this thing of complex problems, I think it's the difference between oversimplification and focusing. You can have a really complex problem and you can oversimplify it and that's not great, but you can have a complex problem and be like, "You know what? I need to hold some things constant." Not going to make any progress unless we hold some things constant to do that. That's, to me, the balance I'm playing all the time between how many variables to hold constant to make sure that people can get some value out of it. I don't know about you, but that's the tension I have. But you write really actionable stuff and so I really admire that too. I'm jealous.

Lenny (00:27:15):
I try, but then I'm jealous of always having to nail it down to something very concrete and simple. This last post actually was a little bit of an balancing act where I wrote about how virality is mostly a myth, and I added the word mostly to it at the end. Then I was like, "Should I just go for it and be like virality is fully a myth?" But no, it's not actually, so I can't really go that far.

John Cutler (00:27:35):
See, it's kind of messy.

Lenny (00:27:36):
It's kind of messy.

John Cutler (00:27:38):
I love that. In the spectrum of advice, every post of mine will say mostly, maybe, it depends, so we all have some opportunity to flex into the other direction.

Lenny (00:27:49):
Shifting a little bit, coming back to just the bigger picture of John Cutler, you've had more exposure I think to product teams and product managers, you're definitely in the top 1% of people that have talked to and met with and seen what happens within product teams. There's a lot of stuff I want to dig into there and the first is around what you've found differentiates the highest performing teams. Let me just ask you this very succinct question and see where it goes. If you had to just boil it down, what have you seen most differentiates the highest performing product teams?

John Cutler (00:28:26):
First of all, they're top 1%, they're super, super productive, they can levitate, they can do ... they have no emotion. No, I'm just kidding. No. Okay, this is my tack for answering the question. First of all, I have this friend Josh Arnold and he had this great principle that held true in my experience talking with teams and he calls it the reverse Anna Karenina principle. In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy is basically the like, "The dysfunctional families are all different and the happy families are the same," and what he said is it's the reverse of that with product teams, that actually the dysfunctional companies are all the same and then the happy companies or the higher performing companies can be very, very different.

(00:29:07):
That's something that stuck with me because either you have easy to identify anti patterns, and I'm going to admit earlier in my career, maybe five or six years ago, my content was about identifying things that people would be like, "How did you know that was working in my company?" and I would just be like, "Well, I just know." Even Spencer and I had this thing. I put something on Twitter and Spencer writes me, he's like, "John, is this about amplitude?" and I'm like, "No man. It's like that Carly Simon song, Spencer. You probably think this song is about you, but it's not." It just is. It's just like those things. Either you have the very easy to identify anti patterns or you have the high level principles, like you must trust each other or you must do something like that.

(00:29:50):
But the way that companies achieve those particular high performing things can be vastly, vastly, vastly different. Let's just start with that as a basic thing, which is one reason why it makes me hard to answer the question. A great example here is great product leadership. We need great product leaders. But you meet [inaudible 00:30:11] product leaders and you see that some people are these humble, curious servant product leaders. They're not really talking a lot and they're just growing the system that way. You know what? There's other companies with really successful people that are just badass, strong, dominant, they like to spar. I need people who can spar with me. That's just one potential example there of okay, you meet enough teams and you see that there's many ways to achieve great leadership [inaudible 00:30:41] example.

(00:30:42):
Another example would be, and then I'm going to start listing these things off and then hopefully this makes more sense.

Lenny (00:30:46):
Yeah, it feels great.

John Cutler (00:30:48):
You meet lots of great teams and the better teams make high, better decisions faster. Now, that's like that high level thing that I say that to you and you're probably like, "Well, no shit. That's what I would assume to do that." But if you think about good decisions and stuff, like what do you need for good decisions? You need information, pays to have diverse perspectives, you need to be able to analyze the data. You probably need chops, some kind of chops in the domain to be able to do it. You usually need a goal in mind, like what are you optimizing for? It's very hard to make a decision just to make a decision to be able to do that.

(00:31:21):
Those are the basics, but still none of that's all that interesting, right? You're like, "Oh, you're saying you need information to make decisions and it's kind of not very satisfying to do that." But then if you think about three companies. We could even play the game together. I'll give you two, you could give me the third one. But let's say company A buys into the whole idea of an extremely rigorous decision-making process. It's very process driven. It's like you do this, you do that, we red team our decisions, we bring in people to push back, we've got this particular thing. Maybe that's how they achieve it. Company B, maybe they're just all about this kind of mushy, diverse perspectives thing. They're not very process driven, but they achieve really good decisions by making sure that there's these serendipitous connections between people at the right time with the right set of [inaudible 00:32:08].

(00:32:08):
There are highly successful companies that achieve both of those particular things. I don't know, what am I missing? Lenny, you think about it. There's the rigorous process driven approach, then there's the company that's all about the ad hoc work together collaborative approach. What's another way that some companies make really good decisions all the time?

Lenny (00:32:28):
What comes to mind is a very top down CEO driven, here's what we're doing, here's the roadmap.

John Cutler (00:32:32):
Absolutely. So this is the thing, I'm sitting there and the very idealistic product managers are like, "You got to have empowered teams and you got to push decision-making down to the bottom," and I'm like, "Huh, well that company's doing pretty well and the CEO just tells everyone what to do and in fact, they attracted people who just don't mind that and like their vision and they do it." You find people who really like the process driven approach and you find people who do those things. That's one principle done a different way. But then I'll just take a couple principles. I just wanted to get that out of the way, that every one of these I mentioned could be achieved in a couple different ways.

(00:33:10):
The first thing you notice is the companies that are very high performing have coherence between the structure of their company and their current strategy. This is a structural thing, I think when there's startups, things are very fluid and the strategy's in flux, and so they have a fluid structure, but then as companies grow, there's sort of a physics to the problem that starts to catch up to the particular things. Their funding approach, their incentives, the org structure, the architecture, even their technical architecture supports their strategy back and forth. The reason why I mentioned this one is you can have brilliant teams. You meet these brilliant teams where they've just hired in the best of the best and they're just struggling with a strategy structure mismatch and no amount of let's empower people or no amount of doing whatever is going to knock them out of that.

(00:34:01):
So what do you need? You need a strategy, then you need to line the structure around it. This is different than saying ... you're asking me what do I observe when they're doing really well? Now, the tactics to achieve this might be different depending on the company, but you could get that. I think the second thing, if I admit it, is the strong opinions loosely held, which is there is this balance of believing in certain things, believing maybe in the power of products or the power of connecting with customers or maybe key strategic things that they need to do, or even believing that this is a done deal and you just need to move faster than everyone else in the space, or even the belief that you need to just go straight to commodity pricing like Amazon with whatever you're doing.

(00:34:41):
There is just a stubborn, strongly held belief that is then balanced with their ability to have the loosely held thing. I would just observed this in meeting after meeting with these teams that seem to be having a bout of being more high performing. They would be stubborn about some things that they were doing even when it didn't make sense in the short term and then they would do that. I think that that's another thing. I think related to that when it comes to the product world is just a core belief in the power of products. The Jeff Bezos thing, that the success of today was set in motion three years ago, that product is a layer cake and that you are layering on decisions, the success you're having now is a layer cake of decisions from the last bunch of years that you're doing it.

(00:35:26):
You could rationalize that all you want, but at the end of the day, it's often because either the founders or other people involved have seen how that can work because there is a leap of faith and there's a leap of faith that no amount of data or no amount of AB testing or no amount of rationalizing or no amount of spreadsheet math to figure out the ROI of what you're doing will ever help you. It's just not. I just noticed that pattern over and over that there was just a slightly irrational belief in the power of what it would take to have a nine craft level product versus a seven craft level product or six craft level product. I think that that's another component. I have a couple more in depth like that.

(00:36:10):
Definitely the leadership is coherent, so that's walking the walk, talking the talk and I think this is one of the most fascinating ones because it's very much about being who you are and not being embarrassed about that thing. There are companies probably all know that outspoken, domineering believe that the company just should be run a certain way and they set this vibe, this coherent ... that their actions and words match together. When you think about it that way, it makes more sense. The company that's like, "Oh, well we want to empower our teams and do whatever and we believe in our customers," and their actions don't match those particular things, that's not very, very coherent to do these particular things. I think that that's one, the coherent things.

(00:37:06):
Okay, so you've got those high level ones. I think you can definitely add skills and experience. I mean, those definitely matter. I think one thing that happens a lot is how the company views its skills. Here's a challenge we had in Amplitude, just sharing this, is you could view Amplitude as just another B2B SaaS company or maybe just an analytics company. But one of the challenges we had when it was how to build our team is to think about where do you draw the line between someone who's just done B2B SaaS for the last 10 years, is a pro at what they're doing and then how someone could embrace this kind of weird problem, sort of bottom-up motion, top-down motion. It's in product, it's a messy space. You need to be more strategic to do that so the skills need to be mediated obviously between the environment to do those things.

(00:37:51):
Then like all the other, they know how to build software, things don't break, they can experiment without risks. I don't know. They have positive habits. I could go on and on. Hopefully this is helpful just hearing my thought process to go through these things. But I think that the TLDR of this whole thing is those top ones I mentioned seem like common sense and it's like how do you put it in motion in your company? I was just reading that working backwards book about Amazon and they're in this chapter about basically their bar raisers thing and I share it with my partner who's the head of HR at a company. She's like, "Yeah, this is sort of common sense hiring. They're just talking about de-biasing the hiring and having standards and having those linked into the jobs and just not rushing it."

(00:38:41):
It's like these things that seem so common sense are actually hard with what they're doing. I don't know if you've noticed that, but it's like a lot of the advice is common sense. That doesn't mean it's easy to put in motion.

Lenny (00:38:53):
Yeah, and there's also a lot of power to just making it a very important value to the company. Just calling it bar raisers-

John Cutler (00:39:02):
[inaudible 00:39:02]. I'll use the example of a company. I mentioned this company AppFolio here in Santa Barbara, but Klaus and Jon who founded that company, it's just a gem of a company, it's an amazing vertical B2B SaaS company. But I think in the story that they tell us when they started AppFolio, they're like, "We want to find a place where the money flows and we want to be really close to customers and we just want to ..." Well, they were engineers who had seen the light around customer development, just getting close to customers, just being in service to the customers, not just gold plating every technical decision you did. They bought in early to the ideas of test-driven development, pair programming because they believe that the quality ... you should never be worried about the quality. They just believe that quality wasn't something you sacrifice as the norm. It's just got to work.

(00:39:51):
They believed that was possible and when you think about it, those things are always debated. Like, "Oh, should we get technical debt or not? Or how much customer contact is it not?" These two founders basically are like, "That's it. We don't sacrifice on those things." They've done really well with that.

Lenny (00:40:08):
That's a thread I want to actually follow up on, is just the power of culture and values and things like that. But before we do that, let me just summarize maybe the top five attributes and kind of traits you just shared and then I have a two part question around this. I wrote these down. Basically the things you've found are true for the companies that seem to be best at building product and software and running product teams. One is coherence between what they're doing and what their strategy is. Two is strong opinions loosely held. Three is belief in the power of product. Four is the leadership is coherent, that their advice matches their words and their actions. Then five is just the necessary skills and experience in building stuff they're building.

John Cutler (00:40:51):
Contextual skills too. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:40:54):
Kind of a two part question. One is if there's a pie chart of what contributes to this working out, what percentage would you say is just the people that they hire that contributes to them succeeding here? Then related question is just like can you change a team to be high performing? Does that happen or is it often just like this is just the way they are and their culture and their founders are this way and it's really hard?

John Cutler (00:41:18):
The pie chart, that's the problem. I mean, that is the trillion dollar question so I don't really have an answer. I have a couple thoughts on it. What do we know? We know that you can have a bunch of geniuses in the room and if there's not coherent leadership and there's not coherent structure in what you're doing, they'll fail. Okay, so we know there's a limit on one side of this particular problem and we know on the other side of the problem is if no one's done this before, who knows? Because how many startups were started by people who hadn't done it before, who had passion for doing something? Now, they made a lot of mistakes. Now, granted people would say, "All right, now after three failures, I'm going to tell you what we need to do to succeed," so maybe they have to fail a couple times to do that.

(00:42:03):
With the right things in motion, you can do that. Also, another data point. At a lot of companies that are known to be higher performing, they're one of two categories. Either everyone in the company is this extremely vetted genius at what they're doing, or they have a culture where people stay for three, four, five, six years, they build their career or seven, eight, nine years. There is a concentration of people who are very skilled, but they have a knack for bringing people up. They have a knack for taking someone who has some of the raw materials to be able to do it and making them really good at their job to be able to do it. I'm not going to throw out a percentage point into it. I'm just going to note that I think that the biggest challenge is that we all need to challenge our biases.

(00:42:46):
I do too. Four or five years ago, I would've said, well, personal skill's nothing. It's all the environment. There's people on Twitter who do this all the time. They're like, "Bad management kills everything. Skills aren't important. You should just be able to do anything with anyone." I used to be one of those particular people and I also have this sort of humanist bent to what I'm doing, and so I very much want to believe ... I'm always the person that's like, "Oh, we should give them the seventh chance." I know myself right to do that and I would suggest that there's people on the other end of the spectrum who could benefit from shifting a little bit to embrace some other ideas too. They're the people who are like, "Well, it's 100% their skill. We will hire complete A plus players all a particular time. Everything will work out as expected." Or they trace everything back to leadership anyway. So when anything's wrong, they're like, "Well, this happened under this person's watch, therefore they are a failure."

(00:43:37):
But how many companies in general will hire a string of highly qualified people into a particular department and then fail each particular time? I don't know. I don't have the answer for you on that one, but I think that everyone can benefit from challenging maybe their happy place, me included [inaudible 00:43:57].

Lenny (00:43:57):
I like that. It's like it's an optimistic perspective basically and anyone can change, anyone can improve. Don't assume that it's just not possible.

John Cutler (00:44:05):
And give it a shot and then can you create a coherent environment where maybe that could happen. Frankly, we're maybe getting into this later, there's a lot of companies that were flying high and are not flying high anymore. High performance is not this state you achieve. It's actually a continuum that you're always ... we have this in our personal lives too. We're flying high and we think we do everything and then we get to that point and then we go back down into feeling we don't know anything again and we feel those lows. That's kind of how I think about that particular thing.

Lenny (00:44:37):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. But getting SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:45:24):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's podcast listeners, get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:45:55):
Coming back to the first question about people, and maybe you just answered this, but do you find that it's all about the people and who you hire and may be at the top that lead to the result at the company? Or you're saying it's sometimes the right amazing people? Sometimes it's the process, sometimes it's the market, [inaudible 00:46:12]

John Cutler (00:46:12):
It's the latter and I think that's why I called the damn thing the beautiful mess. Because I think we all have confirmation bias. We'll point to that company and say ... I mean, let me just use an example. Satya Nadella and Microsoft. You could argue you obviously have someone who's this very humble, very capable leader in that particular thing. But I imagine that at some point in the future there'll be books written about that and they'll say like, "Hey, it was kind of that. But you know what he did? He got rid of some bad people and created the air cover and set in motion the couple of strategic imperatives that we're going to let the things going." Now imagine Microsoft didn't have all the wealth of talent that it had, or all the wealth of structures or the good parts of the tradition, or let's say the bad parts served them well for a long time, but maybe they started to become a little bit outdated and then they were putting them in a competitively bad situation.

(00:47:07):
Even that situation, you can idolize that particular leader for doing it, but there's many things that could happen to be able to do that. There's this idea of great man theory, and this is something I talk about a lot where in great man theory success is the result of these highly influential, highly effective men, in a lot of cases, and that you can explain history through these heroic men. That's sort of a thing. A lot of people base history on doing that. I think that this, again, just the other perspective here is that things are a lot messier and you can't just trace everything to these sort of single heroes men in many cases that make it happen. I'm just presenting both sides of it as we kind of dig into it. I think, though, let's say you're a founder and you're trying to decide, "Should I invest more on processes or should I invest more in people?"

(00:47:57):
The first thing is introspection. What do you believe in really? Not just what do I believe in that you think the whole rest of the world ... I think the rules of the world are that blank happens. It's like what do you believe in and what do the people around you believe in and how can you be a coherent leader? You know what? You can nudge yourself a little bit away from your happy place, but you're not going to go super far. You're not going to go from a process-driven, meritocratic, X, Y, Z person all the way to I'm going to start a collectivist company where everything is sort of the consensus decision to do that. You're not going to do that. But I think it starts with self-awareness and then that's how people form their authentic leadership vibe and then they flex a little bit and then they embrace other perspectives. That's just my perspective on it.

Lenny (00:48:49):
That really resonates. It makes me think about companies, especially in the past couple years, that did really well because the market was pulling them and everything was just killing it. They're just growing crazy and you would assume it's the founder, the CEO, that's the result of that. But then when the market tanks, things stop working, and that's a really good, I think, example of just, it's not necessarily the person. Could just be other factors that make it feel like everything's going great.

John Cutler (00:49:16):
And people are great. There are people that have an outsized effect in particular companies. A great example there is people forget that, for example, leaders or CEOs also have a lot of formal structural power at their disposal to be able to change things. So well, there's that great man leaders, genius. They do have more knobs to move, and even then they're not the boss. You know what? There's a board, there's investors. If you talk to any CEO, they'll be like, "You think [inaudible 00:49:47]. I've got people bossing me around too." It's always a mix. That's the way I see it.

Lenny (00:49:54):
Which is why if things don't go well, their ass is on the line.

John Cutler (00:49:58):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:49:59):
Coming back to a thought I had as you were talking earlier about values and culture, it's interesting that wasn't on your list of just the power and importance of, I don't know, strong value, strong culture. Have you found that that's just not essential? What are your thoughts on-

John Cutler (00:50:13):
No, I think it's kind of the fabric that creates those other things. It's the fabric that creates coherence. Coherent around what? If culture is what we're doing, is what we're acting and the way we act is sort of a function of some of the belief systems and the culture and the value systems that we have, maybe I just almost take it for granted that that's sitting underneath those particular things. But here's an example where sometimes nuances matter. I'll just use Amplitude. We had some values and we had HOG, humility, and it's this idea of ownership and a growth mindset to do these things.

(00:50:52):
Ownership defined in an individualistic culture is going to look very, very different than ownership defined in a collectivist culture. What I find with companies is that ... and certainly we struggled to communicate this too, and I think we were pretty good at communicating where we sat on this particular thing, but a lot of times people write up these cultural documents and they're just like, "Well, this is our culture. We're into ownership." It's not saying much, saying that you believe in ownership without the addition of ... what we would do successfully and Spencer and other people do successfully is talk about the behaviors that represented that level of ownership, then that tells you something about what the culture is. Maybe when I was answering that, I kind of took that for granted. But there's a set of beliefs and values that sit underneath all those things, I bet.

Lenny (00:51:38):
When you think of the companies you work with over the years, and you don't have to answer this if you don't want, but when you think of the companies with the best culture or the best way, or some of the best companies in terms of how they build product, who comes to mind?

John Cutler (00:51:52):
I will mention some companies, but I'm not going to mention what people think in doing this. I'm just going to mention moments where I was like, "This thing is really clicking," and not because it wasn't easy-

John Cutler (00:52:00):
I was like, this thing is really clicking.

Lenny (00:52:01):
Yeah.

John Cutler (00:52:02):
And not because it wasn't easy, or there is a leader at Lego and her name is Angela. And when I'm talking to her, I'm just like, this person just has it dialed in. This is really hard. This business is transforming. They've got one of the biggest, most iconic brands in the whole world at their hands. And I'm sitting and I'm just going to single out her. Yeah, there's this situation here. It's not easy, it's not great. It's not high performing by any, you take a tiny Silicon Valley company. Yeah, it's hard to be Lego with thousands of people trying to build this and trying to take an iconic brand and turn it into something having to do with digital stuff. But I just want to give a shout out to her.

(00:52:47):
That's what I got to say to this question. I think of it more of these moments where I'm like, "Wow, this shits hard. It's not ideal." And that people are coming to work every day and there's a group of people in this room who are extremely well-meaning. And you know what? The impact of their work might not even be seen in their tenure at that company.

(00:53:06):
Some of these larger companies might take a decade to really work themselves through. And so I don't know, when you asked that question, I thought more about individual moments where I spent time with teams or like that team I mentioned to you in India where it's like everyone's super humble and whatever. So...

Lenny (00:53:21):
Awesome.

John Cutler (00:53:22):
Yeah, I'm not going to give a lot of names.

Lenny (00:53:22):
No, it's great.

John Cutler (00:53:23):
But just shout out Angela. She's doing an awesome job.

Lenny (00:53:25):
Go Angela. That reminds me of something I wanted to ask around the cultural differences between product teams in different countries. You talked about India, you talked about Lego. What have you found to be the main differences in how product teams operate and companies operate across different countries like say California versus Paris versus Australia?

John Cutler (00:53:46):
Yeah. And again, I'm not an expert in this and I think Erin Meyer wrote that or Meyer, I'm not sure how to pronounce her name, wrote that book, The Culture Map. And so you should just find what those people wrote because they're much smarter than I am about this. But here's the individual things that I noticed is definitely the individualist and what I would call almost like communitarian vibe.

(00:54:05):
The idea of individualism versus the idea of the team being sort of a community of people together. So that's one, and you pick up about that a lot when you go to different places. I mean, in the United States you'll find this situation where you've got this one engineering manager and they are brokering the projects with every single engineer on their team and everyone wants the promotion.

(00:54:27):
And there's this whole, instead of the PM working with the team, it's like the PM brokering stuff with an engineering manager to give everyone their premier project. No one's really working together. There's no pair programming. There's nothing like that. That's a whole other debate, but. And so that's highly individualistic and it might work in that particular environment.

(00:54:47):
In fact, it might be optimized for environments where you're burning through people every 18 months or 24 months or... Because you just want to put another cog into the particular machine so that you can grow and so you can do stuff. And that's an extreme example, but then you compare that to other parts of the world, it's much more consensus driven. The team perceives itself as a team having a team goal.

(00:55:08):
They have a team objective. And certainly even in the Bay Area, there's companies that are more the collectivist vibe and the more. So to say that it's just about the world is not really just right. So I think that yeah, the collectivist individualistic thing is important. I do think that certain cultures are much more sort of hierarchically oriented.

(00:55:26):
There's much more deference to the hierarchy in the particular where people are sitting and the information flows in a certain way. And some companies tend to that being more bureaucratic. And then some countries tend to that being like, it's still a tall company, but it's very much like you manager, you own this, you do this. So it's not like rules are flowing from the top down. It's more just a pretty big org chart. So those are some of the things that come to mind, yeah, as we're going through it. So yeah.

Lenny (00:55:55):
This relates a lot to something else. You often talk about that much of the advice on the internet and books, newsletters like ours is geared towards Silicon Valley type tech startups.

John Cutler (00:56:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:06):
And in reality, most PMs don't work at companies like that. A lot of them are going through transformations.

John Cutler (00:56:11):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:11):
They're trying to transform the way their culture works. And I imagine a lot of companies you work with are trying to get to that point and that just a lot of advice doesn't actually work for them. What have you found along those lines of just companies going through this and things you've learned there?

John Cutler (00:56:24):
So putting myself in the shoes of those particular companies, like I said, I think some of my most rewarding interactions have been with these non Silicon Valley companies. I certainly learn a lot when I talk to companies in the Bay Area and in the United States to do those particular things.

(00:56:41):
I think that the first thing to keep in mind is that those, let's just take these bigger companies for a second, big enterprise companies. Part of the thing is just realizing how much inertia they're up against when you're chatting them. So I do believe that there's some structural things that probably they could avoid, but then there's also just structural things that are just part of the game to do that.

(00:57:11):
So they'll be in situations where maybe none of the executives have shipped product before. They also assume that there's only one way to do things. Certainly in a lot of high performing companies, I have friends who will go and work at those companies. They're like, "Oh no, no one changes the rules here. We just do it this way at Amazon or we just do it," whatever.

(00:57:29):
So this similar thing happens in these particular companies, like there's only one way to do things. They've got these crazy annual budgeting cycles and planning cycles, or maybe there's a big IT industrial complex that they're sort of trying to transform into doing these things. So anyway, my point is, is that they, so many of these companies just have structural things that make it very difficult to just immediately convert that particular advice as they're doing that.

(00:57:59):
So I think the first thing that comes to mind with that is how to adapt that advice maybe for some of those larger kind of transforming companies. And I think that the couple things that I sort of remark on is that one, reps matter in those particular situations. So in many of those companies, they should focus on creating these sort of areas or pods where a company can, a team can get in the reps that they're trying to be able to do.

(00:58:29):
So it's sort of a little miniature version of that. And there's a whole problem with innovation labs. There's a whole problem with that kind of idea. But the idea that you can create these little bastions where a team can get in the reps is important.

Lenny (00:58:41):
And reps meaning shipping, shipping product.

John Cutler (00:58:43):
Shipping and learning, going through the full loop. Can they go through the full loop of what they're doing? And I think that the other thing that comes up with that is that most of those companies need to think of frameworks appropriately.

(00:58:57):
They'll read about these particular frameworks or what particular companies do or don't do. And I think that for a lot of those companies, they see adopting the frameworks as the end goal. They kind of look there. And sometimes maybe even you write a post, it's like, "Well, how does Figma work?" And they're like, "We use these frameworks."

Lenny (00:58:57):
Yeah.

John Cutler (00:59:15):
And so this company's like, "Well, we've got to use these framework." And I think that the way that I tend to think about frameworks is that they're more like a job aid. They're more like a learning tool that the team kind of uses to keep themself on track. But part of the thing is that those companies will reinvent the things they're using when things aren't working out.

(00:59:34):
So I think that that's another thing maybe some of those companies could benefit from doing, where we're getting kind of more into the kind of digital transformation or the big company space. But I think back to that particular question, I think you need to view a lot of advice coming from Silicon Valley just contextually. It's startup. There's a tradition of how these companies work. Many of them are just optimized very much for that first big arc of growth.

(00:59:58):
They've never really been disrupted. The only disruption has come from scale, not from being a legacy, a huge global brand or huge global business, and then being disrupted by new things. The only problems, not the only because it's really hard, but the problems have been primarily scaling. So they're kind of optimized for wrapping their head around that.

(01:00:20):
And then many of them are just pure digital product companies. And so I think this is a thing that a lot of the big rideshare and food delivery conglomerates are figuring out. They're like, " Oh, this is a lot harder than we thought." When you're dealing with moving people around and logistics and things, it's an order of magnitude more complex to do that.

(01:00:42):
So I don't know if that helps kind of explain my perspective on that, but I think that it's like you have to adapt the advice and you also need to acknowledge that for some of these companies there are these sort of just structural areas of inertia that they're trying to work through and that a lot of them maybe need to adapt this advice on the small instead of thinking they're just going to install all the frameworks or install everything they're doing.

Lenny (01:01:02):
Yeah, this is really, really good advice. I imagine folks are listening that may be working at a company like that. It feels like there's two sides to it. One is there should just be an awareness of this may not work at us, we're not going to be Figma.

John Cutler (01:01:02):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:15):
And let's just get used to that. And then two, this good reflection for me that I'm probably causing some damage with people reading a post on here's how Figma builds product. And then not adding a little bit of, maybe this won't work at your company.

John Cutler (01:01:29):
But maybe it can. And I talk about this a lot, this sort of I do believe there's sort of this fundamental attribution bias at play where people in these high performings don't acknowledge the amount that luck and inertia has been a part of what they're doing. And that the people in the big companies, or these not, these companies that believe that it's not the way that they can do that actually overestimate the kind of systemic drag in their organization and underestimate what can be possible.

(01:01:57):
And you think about that, we do that a lot in just our lives in general. We see someone being really successful and we'll say, "Well, but my situation is this." And when things are working for us, we're like, "I'm a genius. I'm a genius doing this particular thing." When things work, we're competent. When things don't, it's like the system and everyone else's incompetence to be able to do it.

(01:02:18):
So I do think that there's opportunities. I think there's another thing too, that there's a vast spectrum of companies. We paint some of these large enterprises on one end of the spectrum and then these other company, these modern product companies. But I brought up that plumbing company in Australia. You meet these companies, you know what? Their revenue is literally 50 startups. They are not doing bad. They are not doing bad.

(01:02:44):
And you know what? They're actually doing interesting things. One of Amplitude's customers, Anheuser-Busch has this thing called BEES. And BEES is basically a liquor distribution app. And it's literally one of the biggest B2B companies in the world. And you know what? Anheuser-Busch, it's like what? We're going to distribute beer because the pandemic. And so we're going to have, and I think actually they started to become more even used for logistics.

(01:03:06):
You're a bodega in one of those countries, you can order beer for doing it. So I think that we tend to kind of paint this world of, there's the big smoke companies and then there's the fast nimble companies, but there's everything in between. Another example is a lot of tech companies started 2000 to 2008, kind of are on their third or fourth act at the moment, second or third or fourth act, bought a lot of companies, they're trying to absorb them.

(01:03:33):
They might be trying a product-led growth motion by spanning all the different acquisitions they had. You know what? They are on top of their game. This is not a slouch company, but it's really hard for them to do that. Or we at Amplitude, we'd have a lot of, not old FinTech, but not newest companies. They're printing money and they're just embracing this particular thing. And then compare that to, I did a big Northstar session or more of a coaching session at NewBank in Brazil when there was just 15 people in a room and now they're massive.

(01:04:06):
So I think that we tend to paint things as a form of modern product adoption. There's the high performing companies and the low performing companies when in fact there's just a whole plethora and diversity of different companies riding different waves, adopting different things at different times. And many of them doing really wholesome, humble, good work, just dealing with their circumstances at the particular time.

(01:04:33):
So I think everyone should absolutely know how Figma works, for example. And then we need to try to boost the stories of Angela and her team or some of these companies that you'd never even expect. There's a company here in Santa Barbara that's like, they do refrigeration, use AI to refrigerate industrial facilities. And Carrie, who's the leader there, that company is one of the best leaders I know.

(01:04:57):
And Jesse, who's one of the founders is Harvard PhD student who understands AI doing these things. And I actually would encourage a lot of PMs to think about, look, especially in this economy, what are these unsexy businesses that are kicking butt and small here, it's in sunny Santa Barbara? So I don't know. I think that there's a lot more diversity than just the high performing, low performing spectrum. There's just a whole universe of fun companies out there.

Lenny (01:05:26):
Well, as you were talking, I was thinking about there's a small group of people like you and Marty Kagan and a few other folks that have worked with tons of different and diverse product teams and not just say, Silicon Valley teams. And I'm curious if there's any other names of folks you think listeners should follow if they work at maybe a non-Silicon Valley type team. Marty Kagan is who comes to mind first, but I don't know if you have anyone else. And if not, that's all good.

John Cutler (01:05:52):
Well, yeah, there's a couple people, but I feel like I should go back and just generate this full list for people. Maybe it would be interesting. Maybe I'll take that as an action item to...

Lenny (01:06:00):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:06:01):
List a couple of these.

Lenny (01:06:01):
We'll put it in the show notes.

John Cutler (01:06:02):
And I'll give you an example of one guy, and his name is John Smart, and he wrote this book called Better, Sooner, Safer, Happier. And he, I think he was at Barclays Bank. I think that's how you say it in England. And what, he led this transformation. And then I think he's gone on to, he has a consultancy now for doing things. And the guy is just awesome to talk to.

(01:06:27):
He's really, really humble about what the thing book, the book is really interesting. And the thing that I noticed when talking to John is the order of magnitude of complexity of problems that has unraveled and what he had to put in motion to take an old school bank and at least try to get some part of some kind of transformation working in that particular company, I think there's a whole realm of people like that. And I'm going to list a, maybe I'll follow up with a couple more lists of people.

Lenny (01:06:57):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:06:58):
Who can do that. And then I do think there's the people like Teresa Torres and others that have come up with a technique that is universal. You can teach an element of product thinking with her techniques or this opportunity solution tree or this continuous discovery thing that everyone can find accessible no matter where your company is at. And I have a lot of respect for those types of techniques because they're more universal versus some very arcane niche activity.

Lenny (01:07:36):
Awesome. Cool. And then we'll do our best to include whatever full list you come up with in the show notes.

John Cutler (01:07:41):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:42):
So I've been asking a lot of very specific questions. I want to give us a chance to kind of zoom out a little bit.

John Cutler (01:07:46):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:47):
And see what other advice you may have for product managers and the product community broadly. It feels like you're in this kind of reflective phase after working with all these companies and you take time, you have more time to think. So I'm curious what comes to mind when you think of just, here's advice I have to share.

John Cutler (01:08:04):
Yeah. I think kind of going back to the reps thing, I think that there's this fire hose of amazing information that's out there and I contributed to it and you contribute to it. And there's just, I mean, think what a time to be alive. You can literally just.

Lenny (01:08:04):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:08:19):
Get these podcasts going. You can listen to anything you want.

Lenny (01:08:22):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:08:23):
That's pretty amazing. And I was thinking to myself the joke as I saw you put this thing about Andrew Huberman about who gives these sort of life hacks thing. It's like there is absolutely a place for this type of content. I just want someone to summarize what the hell I should do when I wake up in the morning.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Right. Cold plunge.

John Cutler (01:08:39):
Can I be healthier.

Lenny (01:08:40):
Sunlight. Yeah.

John Cutler (01:08:41):
Yeah. I got my sunlight. I went from my sunlight before screens to prepare for our talk today.

Lenny (01:08:47):
Wait, actually?

John Cutler (01:08:47):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:08:48):
That's great.

John Cutler (01:08:49):
I have it in my habit tracker, sunlight before screens every day. Yeah, I got my watch that I got a couple, I'm on vacation. I'm between jobs now. So it's about all health.

Lenny (01:08:59):
Yeah. Optimizing.

John Cutler (01:09:02):
But I think that you need to keep in mind that this is a skill and skill is knowledge times practice mediated by your environment, the habits you form and the motivation that you have and the particular things. And so I think that I learned about that a lot working with learning experience designers in Amplitude that we tend to think that this is just a function of the knowledge that we pick up and the number of podcasts that we listen to. But really it's about going through this loop. So in Amplitude, we have this data informed product loop that we would teach, and it's basically, you need a strategy, you need to develop qualitative models, you need to add measurement to those models. So Northstar framework would be an example of a qualitative model. You need to add measurement to those models, figure out how you're doing it.

(01:09:48):
You need to prioritize where to focus. You need to design bets, you need to measure the impact of those bets. And then you need to circulate what you learned back into the strategy, back into your models, back into how you prioritize, et cetera. And it helps you figure out where you're kind of weak at the moment.

(01:10:02):
So for example, you need a strategy. Without that, nothing is possible. But you could have an amazing strategy and you don't deploy it with the right models, no one can prioritize them. We could do all that right, but you don't design any bets and can't ship anything. Oh, that's kind of a problem. But you could do all that right and you don't know the impact of anything you ship.

(01:10:18):
But you could even do all that right and not circulate the learning back in your company and then you're still not going to succeed in these things. So that's an example of when I mean by the loop. And so one thing you could think about for your career that I think people should focus on, and also in terms of sharing the content that they share.

(01:10:33):
So we're sharing a lot of content around knowledge and job aids, knowledge and job aids, and maybe a little bit of motivation, like how did that person succeed and do that and... But if you think about your career, just think about how many times can you get around that loop and what are you putting, because I worry that people are loaded up with knowledge and feel almost... I meet some of these leaders and they feel beaten up by the advice industry.

(01:11:03):
They feel beaten up that they can never be good enough. They cannot be like whatever company, or they feel like their company's never good enough, like they can't empower their team, they just can't follow anyone's advice. And so I think people are beating themselves up when I think that you shift for some people to focus to taking that knowledge and just getting that loop going for your teams or getting that loop going for your career or getting that loop going for your company is probably a pretty safe bet. So I would think that that's one thing that comes to mind.

Lenny (01:11:31):
Partly being responsible for some of that is what I...

John Cutler (01:11:34):
Yeah, me too.

Lenny (01:11:35):
My advice to people is don't feel like you need to read everything coming across your plate.

John Cutler (01:11:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:11:40):
It's instead wait for the moment when you need that thing. I'm working on SEO right now. Cool.

John Cutler (01:11:40):
Perfect.

Lenny (01:11:45):
I saved that thing about SEO, I'm going to go do it. Just like a just in time learning because you learn it so much better and like, "Oh, shit. I have to load all the stuff in my head in case it becomes useful."

John Cutler (01:11:53):
Absolutely. And I think one thing you think of is think about the podcast you listen to and think about that content is almost like you don't know what you don't know often. So I think that the challenge is, is that if you've been doing PM for a while, product management for a while, you don't really, I don't fit everything in my head.

(01:12:13):
I just, for example, pricing. I know pricing is a thing. I know that there's some people are amazing at pricing. I know that if someone told me like, "Well, you should just price it like this," my spidey sense would say, "You don't know what you're talking about because I know that there's more to it than just what you just said." You develop your spidey sense for things and you know that there's people. You have to dip your toes in understanding. That's the beauty of podcasts, your mind can get blown and then it puts in the back of your brain. You're like, there are some people who know a lot about that versus the founder who believes that they're going to figure everything out for themselves and is just like, no, it's actually a thing.

(01:12:47):
Pricing is a thing or you know what? Meeting design is a thing. There's people who obsess about it or service design is a thing or interaction design or strategy [inaudible 01:12:56]. So that's building on what you said, I think that there is a, especially if you're starting out, there is a definite value of almost seeing the 501 level courses or hearing that genius lecturer.

(01:13:07):
When you're in college as a freshman, I remember, I dropped out, but you would see the genius professor and you wouldn't understand any of it, but you'd know it's a thing and then it helped you guide the way you're doing. So I think that you should kind of balance out those things. But to your point, at the end of the day, you got to just put this stuff in motion somehow.

Lenny (01:13:25):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:13:26):
How to do it.

Lenny (01:13:26):
And then just know that it's there when you need it. Find some way to store it.

John Cutler (01:13:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:13:30):
Save it. Maybe even just assume Google will find it for you.

John Cutler (01:13:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:13:33):
One more question along that same thread is you talked about the importance of going through these loops. At some companies, you just can't really, the company moves slowly, it's super waterfall, they plan really long. Do you have any advice for someone that's like, "Oh, I want to go through loops more often? This is really good advice."

John Cutler (01:13:47):
Point number one is you often underestimate what loops are available to you in that company. They throw up their hands. I've tried to mentor people like this and I think we've done a decent job, but the first thing I'm like, "Just don't throw up your hands and say it's all going to shit." Just at least document what was the.

(01:14:03):
So even if someone from on high says, "Build X," you can at least say, "You know what? Selected option is X. What would the one-pager look like if X was one of five options?" Write the one-pager. Go and talk to that executive and say, "Look, I know you've told me to do this, but what would we observe if this was working versus not working? I'm here to help you with that."

(01:14:27):
Great. You've got some metrics along [inaudible 01:14:29] is what you're doing. Just nudge it. Just one little thing. Hey, nothing's stopping you from writing down all the potential assumptions and risks that you have. Even if someone's like, "Forget all that, you're just going to build the thing." You've gone through the motions for doing it.

(01:14:44):
And I think people underestimate that because the environments are kind of feel like stellifying, I guess is one word, or stilted. And so they just sort of throw up their hands. But I would say that work with what you've got, because the last thing you want is to have a job opportunity two or three years from then and all you can do is shrug your shoulders and say, "I worked at a fucked up. I worked at a messed up company."

Lenny (01:15:09):
You can curse. It's all good.

John Cutler (01:15:10):
Yeah. Well, yeah. So you, "I worked at a messed up company. It was all shit." You're not really honoring yourself for doing that. So I'd say that that's my point about the fundamental attribution bias. Is it hard? Yes. Is it easier in those Silicon Valley companies? Well, maybe not. Maybe those are a shit show too. I've talked to plenty of them that are shit shows.

(01:15:28):
But do you have an opportunity to kind of nudge things forward in your space? Probably. And bring to the systems thing, is it true that some people don't have the privilege of leaving their company for whatever reason? That is true also. So many things can be true, but that doesn't mean that you can't try, I think to kind of almost write your portfolio as you go. Because if you wait two years, you're going to think it was just all a blur and messed up. Whereas the opportunities might be there in your day-to-day as you're working through.

Lenny (01:15:55):
I love how much your advice is optimistic and empowering and not just, "That's the way it is." And...

John Cutler (01:16:00):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:16:02):
And your point about how top tier companies can also be messed up and everything could be going to shit is very true. Especially a hyper-growth company where you're just...

John Cutler (01:16:11):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:16:11):
Constantly changing. It's also very chaotic and things are just breaking all the time.

John Cutler (01:16:16):
And there's people too who just assume it just has to be that way. I would say that one model that I use is the sort of the chronic and acute challenges of the companies. And especially in the last year, you meet a bunch of companies dealing with the same economic conditions. And I will tell you, no, not all companies are equally dysfunctional.

(01:16:34):
And no, not all high performing companies are equally beautiful in all roses. Legitimately some companies work down the chronic issues, which allows them to face the acute stressors, and other companies are just mired in acute issues to do those things. So it's kind of, again, both things can be true. It's like, yeah, there's nothing perfect in product. However, it is true that some companies are healthier than others.

(01:16:58):
An example of that is the companies that leaned in to responding to the pandemic instead of counting the days until it was over. Massive difference. I've seen this over and over, probably with 15 to 20 companies. The companies that were intentional in designing their response to the pandemic versus being like, "Just let managers deal with it, whatever, we're just going to sort it out," have had an order of magnitude better.

(01:17:22):
Now maybe the share price hasn't necessarily reflected it, but the happiness of the people there, they're going to come out of this stronger than the companies that were just like, "It's going to go back to normal and we're going to delay all these org design decisions until some future date." So I don't know if that tells you about high performing, but it's like the high performing companies saw the threat of what existed and then took deliberate steps, coherent steps to frame what their response would be. So that's just an example of that.

Lenny (01:17:54):
Awesome. I took us off track a little bit. I think you were going to go onto a second piece of advice.

John Cutler (01:18:00):
Yeah, I think that there's, well, okay, so one, definitely slightly annoy.

John Cutler (01:18:00):
Yeah, I think that there's, well, okay, so one definitely slightly annoying to me recently... I'll just get into the stuff that annoys me is that-

Lenny (01:18:06):
Let's do it.

John Cutler (01:18:07):
I personally don't think, I used to use words a lot, like product sense and product mindset and product things like that. I'm personally trying to do a better job this year about trying to unpack those things as legitimate skills and competencies. So if you think about product sense, what is it? Might be the ability to model problems, systems thinking, decision-making under conditions of uncertainty, facilitation tools that you have the ability to look at a competitive ecosystem and maybe see a thing and yeah, maybe there's a little bit of sense to it. It's like, "I want to help customers," or whatever. But I think that I'm trying to make a concerted effort to unpack those things into things that could be taught.

(01:18:50):
And that's going to certainly be part of my role at toast. The last thing I want to do is be like you have a product mindset or you don't. A great example, I was even talking with Craig just the other day and we were talking about how in some environments there's this should/can divide, which I really like, which is some people are just locked into the can. They're uber pragmatic people, so it's like, "Can we do this? Is it possible, given the debt, whatever constraints that you have?" And then there's people who for some reason go in and say, "Should we do it? What should we do here? If those things were not an issue, what should we do?" So it's very easy to... I joked with Craig, it's like it's so easy to go down the path of being like, "Well there's can people and should people, there's high agency people and low agency people, there's this person and that person."

(01:19:44):
It's much more interesting to go and be like, "Yeah, there might be a little bit of a personality component to it, but what skills is the should person bringing to bear on that particular situation?" Maybe it's a level of systems thinking, maybe it's a level of looking at the environment and being able to decouple the current tactics from maybe the optimal tactics for doing it. So that's one thing that I'm excited about, to do that. And yeah, there's a bunch of other things. The diverse perspectives, diverse mental models, maybe working with someone like you to try to raise up some of this more diverse... I really want someone to be like who's working at some company X, to be able to go and say, " Now that leader I can relate to, they're dealing with certain challenges that we are having to deal with at our company," and I'd love them to be able to have role models like that.

Lenny (01:20:41):
Like highlight people that aren't on Twitter that are doing the work.

John Cutler (01:20:46):
And not like meeting here. Not any of these particular people where they can say, "Well that leader..." I was speaking to someone recently, I wrote about this in my newsletter and she was just sort of forlorn. She was like, "I follow these people in this space and I know what my beliefs are and I know that that person has beliefs that I'm not sure vibing with completely. But the message to me is, the only way to get ahead in tech is to have those beliefs. And John, is that right? Do you need to believe this?" In this case, it was this very individualistic, very meritocratic kind of get ahead, push ahead type of vibe, which I respect that thought leader for putting out there, but this person didn't buy into it, which would've all been okay except she said, "Is there a place for me in this environment. Will I need to sacrifice my beliefs to get ahead?"

(01:21:42):
And I told her about some companies that I know. I told her about Carrie, who I just mentioned, who's been working on building the diversity, even in a small company. I told her about different leaders in different companies that, "Hey, there's some companies where it is a real team vibe and there's some companies that that", and she was like, "That's really good to know. So I think that that's one thing I want to work on in the next year, to make sure that people have role models and not the people talking like me, but actual... Maybe I could be a role model to people in my new role, but ideally there's role model leaders who they can relate to. That would be great.

Lenny (01:22:16):
Awesome. I love that. I feel like you just talking about that makes an impact there. Something I'm definitely trying to do with this podcast is not just have all the same people that we see on Twitter all day and have a lot of people people have never heard of, but if you have suggestions, let's definitely talk offline. I'd love to do more and more of this.

John Cutler (01:22:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:22:33):
So those are clearly some of the things on your mind as you're kind of in this period of reflection. I'm curious if you are going to keep writing and keep your newsletter up, maybe publish more books and then just broadly, how do you make time, while you have a day job, to write? Because a lot of people always wonder that. I'm curious if you have any pieces of advice.

John Cutler (01:22:54):
I'm obsessed with the writing, obviously, and I think a bit of background about me is I was pretty involved in music and song writing and it was similar kind of thing, I just liked writing lots of songs. I like that there's a certain buzz you get when you're creating. And in the case of music, it'd be like you record the demo and you get it out there. I think what people have correctly picked up on is because I have a full-time job, sometimes it'll be Thursday night and my kid's finally asleep and it's one in the morning and I'm just like, "I've got to write this post." And so sometimes it comes off as being a little bit rough or even accentuating the fact that I don't give them an answer because it's like two o'clock in the morning now and I don't want to give them an answer. I want to go to sleep to do these things.

(01:23:43):
So I think one of the things I'm going to hope to do is maybe be more deliberate about trying to provide at least maybe some mental models for dealing with the mess. I mean there's things like that out there. There's this thing [inaudible 01:23:57], which is a way to understand the systems and decision-making problems have, are you dealing with a clear system, a complicated system, a complex system, or a chaotic system? And I like things like that because that helps do two things I like. One, I want to give people something actionable to be able to address what they're doing, but it doesn't remove the complexity in the particular situation. So I have role models in that. This guy, Simon Wardly does this kind of mapping, which I think is great. There's these other techniques that I want to try to lean into and maybe develop some of my own that sort of help people have something actionable and embrace the mess, if that makes sense.

(01:24:41):
So for example, I recently wrote about something called the leadership, the Pyramid of Leadership, self awareness. And it's a simple model, but it goes deep how I want it to go deep. So the idea is that at first we know nothing about ourself and then the next level is that we start to become self-aware, but believe the whole world is wired just like we're wired. And then you go up to the next level and you believe that the world thinks different things, but you still think your way is the best way to be able to do that. So an example is, I remember talking to an executive and they're like, "People only stay because of their managers and because of their money. That's it." And I said, "Everyone?" They said, "Yes." "Do you believe that?" "Yes, because everyone believes it. It's a physical law of light." And here I am like, "Oh my God, I joined a company because the mission of the company or whatever."

(01:25:23):
So they're kind of stuck down on that second level where they believe that, "Yeah, the world thinks different things, but I'm absolutely right." And then as you get up to the top, you become a little bit more aware that there's other valid views and then at the top you're sort of like, "No, you don't dishonor yourself and throw away who you are, but you realize that this is a huge asset in the world, that there's diverse views that you can bring together to do really, really amazing things." So that's an example of some writing I've even done recently where I'm kind of like, it's a complex topic, but I try to make it more actionable to do that. So that's one whole thing. The other thing too is leveraging all the crap that I have. I think it's like 700, 800 posts, maybe 900.

Lenny (01:25:23):
Wow.

John Cutler (01:26:07):
I had this whole blog beforehand that I did it. And then I have these hundreds of images with these frameworks and then it's like 50, 70 talks that I've done floating on YouTube and then there's all the mural boards I made at Amplitude. It's a different model. So I kind of feel like I could pull some of that together to make it more actionable for people, give people almost like a meta guide to Cutler content so that they're not just dropped into me writing something at 1:00 AM and being like, "Oh, just another one of those." Like, "Damn it, you didn't give me an alternative to NPS. This newsletter sucks." I mean, frankly, I would say the same thing too if I just stumbled into the newsletter to do it. So those are a couple things that I'm thinking about for the content, definitely not going to stop doing those, sharing those things and doing that. So yeah, excited about this next year.

(01:26:52):
Also, the question about writing, I mean, one thing with a full-time job where most of my work is internal, obviously I need to respect my team. Again, I go back to that funny thing with Spencer, he is like, "You're writing about Amplitude." I'm like, "No, dude, I'm not writing about Amplitude. It's like every company has that problem." But if I'm working alongside people, I obviously can't be like, "No," I can't say, "Oh, your manager sucks." It's like Craig's going to read that to do that particular thing, but I can, what I'm really excited about is that part of my job will be involving doing a lot of writing and a lot of teaching, is hopefully work it out with the company so that I can share things that are not too specific about the company, but much more. They've got five different businesses at Toast, they've got all these people, so it's going to be a education every day. So I'm hoping to maybe get that inspiring my work in different ways.

Lenny (01:27:40):
Amazing. I imagine you might rename your newsletter The Beautiful Mess, slightly less messy.

John Cutler (01:27:46):
Yeah. Jam and Toast. The Jam and Toast decision. The addition.

Lenny (01:27:50):
Delicious.

John Cutler (01:27:51):
Yeah, there we go. 2023.

Lenny (01:27:52):
Also, as you were talking, I imagined a chat GBT three type chat bot powered by John Cutler content could be something to try.

John Cutler (01:28:01):
Oh, it could be a funny, yeah, I mean I'm sort of obsessed. I like the ChatGPT thing because I like having things, having a developer inspired by Hemmingway debate, a developer inspired by Tolstoy discussing how to resolve a GIT issue. So that's what I've been obsessed by lately is when you know how ChatGPT works, you can actually make it do really funny things. And back to the worldview things, it's actually really effective. This is a very actionable tip, if you feel you're heavily grounded in let's say the, I don't know, maybe you're like a hardcore objectivist or you believe in individualism, you can just type into ChatGPT and say, "Take this situation and interpret it by five different worldviews." And it'll be like, you'll get the humanist view and you'll get the communitarian view and you'll get the collectivist view. You'll do that. So anyway, it's a fun tool for that. It's really cool.

Lenny (01:28:52):
It is awesome. We checked the checkbox talking about AI, very, very hot these days.

John Cutler (01:28:57):
Yep. Score.

Lenny (01:28:57):
Score. One final question before we get to our exciting lightning round, I'm going to come back to the questions that folks asked you on Twitter. And there's a question that I saved up and the question, it was by Jeff Fedor and his question to you, he was, "What have you always wanted to say but couldn't now that you're between gigs?"

John Cutler (01:29:18):
Oh, that's good. So one thing is I didn't really need to filter myself very much when I was at Amplitude, which is kind of the beauty of the gig. I wrote this blog post, probably six years ago called How to Know You're Working in a Feature Factory. And I've always, this has all been my jam. The outcome, outcome and impact focus thing. So it's not like I've really had to hide anything. And so one thing I could say is the power of qualitative data, but even Spencer says that too. He's talking about early on in Amplitude you can rely a lot on qualitative data. So that wouldn't be all that controversial. That's a funny thing. There's not that much, I pretty much say what I say partially under the guise that I'm talking to so many teams. So therefore it's never about Amplitude. Absolutely not.

(01:30:07):
I think the one thing that I would change, I don't think that many people in the company would disagree with me, but one anti pattern I see a lot on the part of implementing analytics is that people go in and undertake this huge implementation. They want to implement all their events, they want to get, they want to treat it like this big project. And again, I don't think it's too controversial internally, but I think I might have been much more adamant to people that's just like use our free plan and get 20 events going and you might wipe them out later, but you don't even know what you don't know yet. You would see these companies that are really qualified companies and it would be a couple months of back and forth of them trying to document every question they have and every metric they need and everything that you had.

(01:31:02):
And I would watch them and I understood why they were doing that, but I really just wanted to shake them, which again, I wouldn't have done this because then I would've been talking about the companies I was talking about every day. I just wanted to shake them and just, "Sit me down with the developers at your company for three hours and let's like Hello world, a couple events here, this is, you could be getting value this whole time." And again, I don't think that people at Amplitude would disagree, but I think that that's, I wasn't going to talk about that all day because that would be sort of belittling customers who do want this big implementation thing. So pretty kind of inside baseball for analytics, but that's one thing that I was thinking about for Jeff.

Lenny (01:31:41):
Awesome. Great answer. Also actionable advice. How about that?

John Cutler (01:31:44):
Yeah, can do. You just need to find it. You just send me a message and say, "Do you have the actionable advice for it?" I probably do somewhere. I just maybe didn't have the time to organize it.

Lenny (01:31:53):
Good tip. You're going to get a lot of DMs. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm just going to go through and whatever comes to mind fire away. Are you ready?

John Cutler (01:32:06):
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Lenny (01:32:07):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

John Cutler (01:32:11):
Yeah, this one's pretty easy because they are fairly similar lately. So I really like the book How to Measure Anything, finding Intangibles or Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business. So that's by Douglas Hubbard. And the reason why I like that is again, at Amplitude the number of people who would come in like, "What are all our competitors measuring? We want to know exactly which metric to measure." And again, I'm laughing with you because I know you have these posts. Here's exactly the metrics that you should track. I really respect those posts and that's the power that you have. That's all really good. But what Hubbard reminds you is why the hell are you measuring things to begin with? It's to reduce uncertainty for critical decisions or to achieve certain objectives that you have. The reason why it's important to read that book is A, you figure out someone who's again, actionable, has thought this through. So he gives you kind of a framework to thinking about it.

(01:33:02):
But B, he really challenges this idea of when making decisions in conditions of uncertainty, you only need to reduce the uncertainty to an acceptable amount to be able to make the next decision that you need to make. And we never have, people are like, "Product is science." It's really an art, like a game that's being played out. You never have complete information to do it. So I think that's a good book to remind people about what... To be more creative and thinking about measurement instead of thinking about measurement and metrics is just about adopting the exact metrics that everyone has and doing that.

(01:33:36):
The second one I think would probably be Accelerate. So Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble, that's just one of the best books in the world about the factors contributing to performance. And it's built on many... It's six, I don't know, it's been out for a while now, 10 years? They did the Dora report, which was their yearly report where they did big surveys, like 10, 20, 30, 40,000 people responding to it. And Nicole Forsgren is an amazing scientist. So they structure their thing correctly. They would have a hypothesis about what is equal to performance and how all these individual practices contribute to it.

(01:34:19):
And then they've updated it over time. And I think that Google bought Dora, I don't know exactly how all the parts came into place, but that book is amazing, just sort of teaching you how to think about the idea of performance because they'll include things like the Western topology, which is your company operating a bureaucracy or... These certain culture elements to it, but then also the practices and things that you're doing. So that's a great book when you're trying to think about, "How do I model performance?" And then it's also an amazing book because you can just literally put the stuff into motion about improving your development practices and things you're doing.

(01:34:58):
And then I think probably the last one, man, I just love this book, this Jeff Patton book about user story mapping. I love what Jeff Patton did. He took this extremely simple idea, which is that you can lay out a customer journey and then organize, take a slice across that journey and develop it. And he gives this pretty basic straightforward method to do it. But I tell you, I'll go into companies like a year after they had Jeff in and learned this and they're still like buzzing about, "Hey, user story map." And it's just, he's a super humble guy and he would never outstate the value of this. He'd be like, "Yeah, it's just a journey map with a couple sticky notes on it." But I always, when someone's new at product management, I'm like, "Hey, this is a deceptively simple book. You'll learn this very basic idea, but it'll teach you a lot about product when I do that." So those are three that come to mind.

Lenny (01:35:50):
Killer suggestions, I love answers of books I've never heard of that seem really amazing. So you check the checkbox there. Thank you. Next question. Favorite other podcast other than the one you're currently on?

John Cutler (01:36:02):
I'm in a... I got a four-year-old. I don't really spend a lot of time... I'm the sort of, I'm such a lightweight, it's like I'll do knowledge project because Shane sent me, you know what I mean? I'll just listen to some, I'll binge things, but I do really like, I've actually been going through old episodes of Maggie Crowley's podcast that she did when she was at Drift. Lots of good guests and I really like Maggie's perspective and I like the guests that she had on there. So sometimes I'll go back to an old podcast. He does these really great memes and stuff, but Jason Knight actually has a fun podcast that I listen to and some of those things. So I think that, but realistically I'm not a huge podcast listener. I'd like to go back to a podcast that hasn't been out for a while, like Maggie's and just sort of catch up on all the guests because I thought that was really good.

Lenny (01:36:52):
Awesome. Jason, we love hearing that. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

John Cutler (01:36:57):
Oh man, again, I have a kid. It's nothing. There's this thing called, there's a show called Sunny Bunnies. It's these fluffy bunnies. That's really good. And then there's this animated series called Booba and he's this funny guy. I like Booba [inaudible 01:37:13].

Lenny (01:37:13):
Great. I'm sure these will be useful to families.

John Cutler (01:37:17):
Hardcore product, movies. Really, those are going to up your game a lot.

Lenny (01:37:22):
Yeah, I'm sure there's something to learn. Two more questions. Favorite interview question that you like to ask folks?

John Cutler (01:37:30):
Oh, so one that I like to do is, I do the behavioral questions like, "Tell me about stuff," but then I'll ask them like, "Imagine I'm interviewing a person you worked with. Now answer in there, tell me about of the same situation." So you'll be like, "Oh, Lenny, tell me about a time that you were faced with adversity and you did this and then you worked with the team to do it. And you would go through it and then you'd answer it.

(01:37:55):
And then maybe in the process of doing that, you mentioned someone you work with and I'll be like, "Now imagine that you're Mary, who you just spoke about, and things, and how would she answer the tell me about thing as it relates to you?" And so I think it can show some really interesting self awareness. Often people answer that question like they are the hero of the story and the other people are the accomplices in it, but then if you challenge them, "What was that story from the perspective of one of the people you worked with?" I think it's really interesting.

Lenny (01:38:21):
Awesome. [inaudible 01:38:23].

John Cutler (01:38:23):
So it is a behavioral question. I do think that's the right way and if you dig enough you can really get the depth of the story, but I do think it's fun to challenge people to see how flexible their thinking could be about that situation. I don't know if that's right from an HR perspective, but I like it.

Lenny (01:38:39):
I like it too. Final question, you mentioned you have kids. What's the best lesson someone taught you about raising kids?

John Cutler (01:38:45):
It's a challenge every day. I just think they operate better when they are fed. The kid as a product is like if you feed the product, then they were just, everything's better. And when you don't, like everything falls apart. So just have snacks with you. That's basically the advice that I have for people.

Lenny (01:39:04):
Very practical. Look at you, actionable advice left and right.

John Cutler (01:39:07):
Yeah. You got it.

Lenny (01:39:09):
John, and I feel comfortable calling you John now, I feel like I just got to know you. You're just like, "I'm John now." We hit our goal of, I think it's going to be the longest episode I've done. This was amazing. John, we've reached the end. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask questions if you want them to? And then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

John Cutler (01:39:32):
I still am using Twitter a fair amount I think, but LinkedIn could be good. John Cuttlefish on Twitter and then just John Cutler at LinkedIn. Yeah, I think what I would love to hear from people is just send recommendations of people we should hear more from. I think that would be really helpful. Even in the role that I have, I want to start like a guest speaker series to bring people in to talk to our team. And so I think that that would be something that I can work on.

Lenny (01:40:02):
Amazing. John, thank you so much for doing this. I'm really excited for this new adventure that you're on, and I'm excited to maybe follow up maybe in a couple years of just what you've learned from this next phase of life.

John Cutler (01:40:14):
I really enjoyed the show and thank you for having me.

# The crazy story of landing Uber as a client | Jonathan Becker (Thrive Digital)

## Transcript

Jonathan Becker (00:00:00):
There's a lot of different ways that we are beginning to use AI to do more with less, basically. The effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. We have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic. It's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers. And less so the like trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.

(00:00:35):
On our creative group, we can come up with mockups, in literally, 1% of the time that it took. And so you still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, "Do we like this more or do we like this more?" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jonathan Becker. Jonathan is a legend and an OG in the world of performance marketing. On this podcast, we've done deep dives into the many aspects of growth, including SEO, sales, conversion optimization, retention, product led growth, product led sales. But this is the first episode where we get super deep on paid growth. For the past decade plus, Jonathan and his team have planned, built, and executed more than $3.5 billion in paid acquisition budgets for companies like Uber, Asana, Square, Masterclass, Tempur-Pedic, and many more. And they've built their agency, Thrive Digital, into one of the preeminent independent digital marketing agencies. In our conversation, we get real deep into all things paid growth, including what's changed with recent privacy shifts, why focusing on creatives is the new biggest opportunity within paid growth. How to think about attribution, and what's changed there. What to look for in people you hire to run paid growth for you, how AI is already changing how paid growth teams operate, and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Jonathan Becker after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:16):

(00:04:46):
Jonathan, welcome to the podcast.

Jonathan Becker (00:04:48):
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

Lenny (00:04:50):
It's my pleasure. What we're going to be doing with this episode, is we're going to be digging real deep into all things paid growth, which we've never done on this podcast yet. And normally I actually skip this part, but I thought it'd be actually helpful for you to spend a little bit of time to give us a little bit of background on your experience in the space of performance marketing, AKA paid growth, AKA paid ads. You tell us what the right term is for this genre. But yeah, just tell us what you've been up to in this area over the past decade and a half, I think.

Jonathan Becker (00:05:20):
Sure. No, that's a great way to kick things off. And again, thank you for having me here. If I think about it, my experience goes back about 15 years into this space. I started off as a web developer. And as I built and structured websites for people, I became pretty obsessed and fascinated with the fact that you could build landing pages or homepages, or whatever it was. Basically the content on a website, and structure it in a manner where you had the chance to surface in organic, so SEO results more prominently. And as I became a practitioner of SEO, SEO really being my first love of marketing, I started attracting attention and people wanted to hire me on as a freelancer. And what I noticed is that as people started asking me questions like, what was the ROI of our SEO campaign? Or, how do I scale this, or whatnot? The answers to their questions ended up being a lot more aligned with what then was the biggest driver in the paid acquisition world, which was paid search.

(00:06:25):
And so I started experimenting with paid search. And what I found was that it was a tangible format and lever through which we could basically give people the types of results they were expecting from SEO, but that were obfuscated in terms of Google's analysis algorithm from an organic point of view being somewhat intangible. And Google slowly removing a lot of the data early on that allowed you to guess and test more easily. 10 plus years later, what started off as this freelancer consultancy that I started running in a walk-in closet in my old apartment, became 130 people. And we manage about $500 million a year in ad spend for small and large companies, including Uber, Asana, Tempur-Pedic. We've worked with Lululemon. Very exciting companies, mostly from the United States, even though we randomly happen to be based in Vancouver, Canada.

Lenny (00:07:26):
There's a number of threads I'm going to pull on there over the course of our chat. But you mentioned Uber and you told me that you had a crazy story about how you actually landed Uber as a customer. Could you share that?

Jonathan Becker (00:07:35):
I had been running Thrive for a couple years, and it was a very excellent regional agency in Canada with really cool local clients. In 2013, I got invited to go down to the TED conference, which was in Long Beach, California. And my friend Andrew Wilkinson asked me to join him at a dinner that night. I didn't know anybody from the TED community at the time. So we have dinner, and then afterwards as it goes at conferences, there's an after party. And so essentially I hop into a taxi, everybody else sped off in their cars, or however which way they were getting there. And as we're talking to the driver saying, "Hey, we're going to this place, can you take us?" There's a knock on the window and the person outside says, "Hey, I think I'm heading to the same destination. Do you mind if I hop in this car with you?"

(00:08:25):
And so we're like, of course. And I turn to him and I'm like, "I'm Jonathan. I run a 10 person agency out of Vancouver." And he says, "Hey, I'm Garrett Camp. I started a company called Uber." And so ironically, I meet the founder of Uber, the company that is in the process of disrupting the entire taxi industry worldwide in the back of a taxi cab. And what happened next basically changed my career forever. We end up at this party. At the time I was spamming Uber's referral program. Kind of a long story, but essentially I was using paid search to camp out on their branded keywords. And as people would sign up with my confusingly similar snippet to Uber's organic snippet, I was essentially siphoning off referral credits. So I would get $20 every single time someone signed up.

(00:09:18):
And I ended up making tens of thousands of dollars doing this. And so fast-forward, I'm getting a drink at the bar next to Garrett, and in my head I'm like, should I tell him about this? Maybe I can land them as a client. This would be really interesting. And essentially I tell him, I'm like, "Hey, I'm doing this. I'm adding zero value, but this is a loophole in your marketing system, and someone should close it." He essentially is like, "I need to report this to the board, but here's my card, write me what you're doing and we'll contact you." And so I get contacted by a bunch of his lieutenants. If you've read the book, Super Pumped. All the people that we dealt with at the time are in the book, and [inaudible 00:09:58]-

Lenny (00:09:58):
I watched the show.

Jonathan Becker (00:10:00):
Yeah, exactly. And they were like, "Hey, this is bad, you have to stop doing this. But can we hire you to solve the problem?" And so what started off as me running projects for local bars in Vancouver, or clothing stores, or whatever it was. Turned into me landing early stage Uber as a client, and really graduating us from competent professionals to leaders in our sector. And so it was a fascinating project, and we worked with Uber for 10 years.

Lenny (00:10:32):
That is an incredible story. I love the arbitrage game you're running there. It's basically siphoning VC money out of Uber. And I guess the lesson there a little bit is just sometimes it's this interesting combination of hustle in terms of just make some money, and also taking advantage of this opportunity you were plopped into.

Jonathan Becker (00:10:53):
Yeah. I think people often talk about entrepreneurs who have been successful and they comment that they're lucky. Whereas, I actually look at that situation and I think that you have to make your own luck. I could have been like, oh, cool, I met this guy in the back of a taxi and that was it. But I decided to take a risk, being that I could get embarrassed or nothing could happen, or they could shut down this referral gimmicky thing that I was doing. I had very little to lose, I guess, ultimately. But a lot of people just don't make these moves in life because they're nervous, or they're worried too much about what the downside might be. And so I very much was like, I'm going to shoot my shot here. And you put yourself in situations where everybody has luck, but you have to capitalize on it basically. And so that was an example of being willing to take a risk, and it paying off pretty big time I think.

Lenny (00:11:46):
Also, being at Ted, that seems like a good move. Networking, paying off. Love that he was in a taxi, that's hilarious. I was going to ask you about that. And clearly, he's doing some research [inaudible 00:11:55].

Jonathan Becker (00:11:54):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:58):
Let's start diving into the world of paid growth. And if you think about just paid growth.. And again, actually, what do you refer to this area as? Paid growth, performance marketing, paid ads?

Jonathan Becker (00:12:08):
There's a lot of interchangeable terms. Performance marketing is a common term. Paid acquisition is a common term. Some people think of those two things as growth marketing, whereas I see growth marketing as a bigger practice area within which paid acquisition sits. And then of course there's subsets, there's social ads, there's paid search, there's programmatic. And so there's a lot of different ways of saying the same thing.

Lenny (00:12:31):
I'm going to use performance marketing. I like that term because it really describes what it is. It's like marketing with you can measure performance. Let's see how that goes. As a channel, it's such an interesting mix of, on the one hand it's this incredible growth lever that allows basically any company to spend money and understand the ROI and acquiring the users. This thing that never existed before. Essentially Facebook and Google created these platforms. On the other hand, there's this sense that it's this drug that you start and then you get hooked on and you can never leave. And there's a lot of advice of just, avoid paid growth. That's just not a good healthy way of growing, especially as a startup. And so my question to you is just, how do you think about that element of it? And then even more specifically, what products do you find paid growth as a channel is right for and not right for?

Jonathan Becker (00:13:24):
Yeah, it's a really great question. And so, I think there's a couple different things that need to be unpacked here. Paid acquisition or performance marketing-

Lenny (00:13:33):
Performance marketing. [inaudible 00:13:35]-

Jonathan Becker (00:13:34):
... you can call it, can be seen as a drug, I suppose, when you are entirely reliant on it to fuel the revenue of your business. The analogy that I try and use here is that it would be very dangerous if I was advising you with your life savings and I told you to put it all in a single stock in the stock market. Stocks can be volatile. And as a result of that, your net worth would fluctuate quite a bit in the short-term and the long-term based on a lot of things that you don't control, like the external markets, or things that are happening within the performance of that particular company that you invested in. When I think about all of the marketing mix, so email, direct mail, linear television, performance, marketing, whatever it is, I think about it as investing capital with the expectation of a return. And in the same manner that I would not take all of your life savings and dump it into a single stock, I don't recommend putting all of your money into a single performance marketing channel, and then somewhat exposing you to the volatility of fluctuating CPCs or changing market conditions. I would agree with you that it is a drug, in a sense, if you have all of your eggs in one basket, and that basket takes you on a very intense rollercoaster in terms of performance. But when I think about the fact that Thrive manages $500 million a year, I think of myself to a extent as a fund manager, we are managing people's money with the expectation of a return. And part of the strategy is to diversify across channels. And so we decrease the reliance of any individual project on a singular channel and its performance.

(00:15:26):
And similarly, I always say to people that the first rule of performance marketing is not to forget about offline marketing and the classic marketing that works for organizations. In other words, direct mail can really work, email marketing works beautifully, SEO can really work. There's all of these wonderful things at your disposal. The real crash and burn scenarios that I've seen are these, not fly by night brands, but brands that figured out... Just like with Uber, I figured out this weird tie-in where I could make free money from their referral system. Sometimes people find shortcuts, hacks if you will, to scale rapidly because of one specific nuance of the Facebook ad platform, or something like that. And what they fail to see is that those loopholes come and go.

(00:16:19):
And so if they scale massively and their entire business is predicated on the performance of this one loophole that they found, or investing everything in a single channel, and then the conditions change, they're not going to be very happy and the business will suffer dramatically. And so when I think about this, it's a responsible channel mix, diversity, and understanding that you can't be overly reliant on performance marketing for the success or failure of your business.

Lenny (00:16:48):
What about the second part of that question of when you think about when companies come to you. What do you look for to help you understand this is going to be a really good fit for performance marketing and this is going to give them a lot of opportunity to growth, versus maybe not, maybe it'll be a small sliver but it's not going to be a massive success for them?

Jonathan Becker (00:17:06):
Yeah. I would say that the answer to that question is different at different stages of a company's life cycle. Early stage, look at what the company is doing, look at your own company. Have you established product market fit? Is this an idea that has yet to be tested, and are they entirely looking to performance marketing to scale everything? Are they at risk of it becoming an over-reliance on performance marketing? At a later stage we look at certain criteria that they might or might not possess. Typically, that will come down to resourcing.

(00:17:43):
The question at a later stage is not, does it work? But, to what scale can it work? And so we are looking at things like, do they have adequate creative resources and buy-in? Does creative resourcing tie into performance, and can we create a feedback loop there around testing? I'll talk to you about that in a bit. Do they have professional marketers on staff? Are there people who have experience doing what we do, that speak our language so to speak? Or is part of this an organizational educational, and creating buy-in through stakeholders process that needs to take place? Do they have technical resources? If we say, "Hey, tracking and attribution is broken, here's how to solve that." Can you implement it? And so on and so forth.

(00:18:27):
There's no one magic formula for what works or what type of company will be successful on performance marketing channels. Just as evidence of this, Google, which I think had a down quarter reported sales this week, and it was $70 billion in three months. And Facebook similarly just recorded yesterday evening, and it was $32 billion. That's $100 billion on just Google and Facebook in three months, and the majority of that revenue is from ads. This works really well for lots of different companies, it's just a question of at what scale.

Lenny (00:19:06):
Just to pull an thread a little bit more. Something I've heard from other guests is that paid ads are best for products where you get basically payback really quickly, basically to feed the flywheel of spend so that you're not sitting around waiting for someone to buy something in the future, or it's a small trickle of pay. How important is that, I guess? Do you find that you could just do paid growth for any company, it doesn't matter their business model? Or is there something you're like, okay, this needs to exist for you to invest serious resources? And even hire that team that you just talked about.

Jonathan Becker (00:19:37):
It's always nice when there's a quick turnaround on investment and return. And that's wonderful for like D2C or e-commerce style businesses where they're essentially taking the revenue to fuel additional inventory and operating costs. However, not all businesses work that way. And so, in a B2C or B2B lead generation scenario, we have to undertake pretty sophisticated modeling around these abstract concepts, like lifetime value. Which is difficult, because most businesses are relatively new that we work with, and so the idea of lifetime value is a misnomer. They don't know what that is yet.

(00:20:15):
But we have to model things like LTV to CAC, so cost per acquisition costs versus lifetime value and the period within which the payback occurs. You end up getting to a pretty sophisticated place where you can build out things like a lead scoring model, which predictively can determine in a statistically significant way the likelihood that one lead will convert to revenue over another. And so there are ways around the slower payback period that still end up being pretty accurate based on what you're bidding on today versus the latent revenue that will be accrued to those campaigns through attribution.

Lenny (00:20:58):
Do you have any just rules of thumb for someone listening and trying to decide, is paid a real model for us, either on LTV or CAC, or payback period? Or something just like, here's what you probably should have, especially early stage for you to feel like paid growth is going to be a great lever for you to use, and maybe a primary lever.

Jonathan Becker (00:21:18):
Product market fit. If you know that your business sells into audiences. Let's say you are a social media influencer or you had a really strong email marketing game, or organically your content surfaces within Google search results. Or, you did a lot of direct mail and linear television and billboard advertising and that worked. If other things work, it is highly likely that paid acquisition will work. The issue for most companies is in this incorrect assumption that the data that is provided through paid channels allows you to have full end-to-end understanding of attribution. Which is wrong, it's never been that way. And the other aspect of this is the patience to understand that every business is unique, and these metrics that we know are important are different for every business. Lifetime value, like propensity to repurchase, ROAS, which is return on amount spent, CPA, CAC, all of these different things are different for every business.

(00:22:24):
Even if I worked with two hotels in the same city, they would have different results based on the nuances of their budget, their brand, the market that they sit within, the services that they offer, and so on and so forth. I think that everything else, the main problem here is that nobody should expect an overnight turnaround with performance marketing. It is a very difficult channel to manage, and that's why people hire experts like us to help them with it because it's a never ending problem with constantly changing issues. It's always been like that, that's not a new thing since pandemic, or whatever. And it will take some time to work out what works.

Lenny (00:23:07):
I have this framework of there's these four growth channels, basically growth engines is what I call them. There's paid/performance marketing. There's SEO, there's virality in their sales. And essentially there's some companies whose growth is almost primarily paid. A few that come to mind are booking.com, which we know well at Airbnb, which is almost all paid growth driven. Credit Karma comes to mind as a classic paid performance marketing. I keep coming to paid growth as my term, so I'm just going to stick with that. TikTok initially was very performance marketing, paid growth oriented. Wish was another one I think about.

(00:23:42):
And I want to talk about how much things are changing within this realm. But before we get there, do you think there's still an opportunity for startups to emerge where they get to scale almost exclusively through performance marketing? And this question actually came from Twitter, someone tweeted this randomly the other day. And I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan. And by the way, her name is Liz.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan, and by the way, her name is Liz Georgie asked this question, so there you go.

Jonathan Becker (00:24:06):
I'll put it this way. Every unicorn from the 2010s era that scale did performance marketing, but not everyone during that time who did performance marketing scaled. So I want to remove the bias here that just because all the successful organizations did this didn't mean that it was a magical channel for everyone. We had plenty of projects that we worked on that flatlined during that period. And so the sense that there was a period of time where this was easy or it worked on any project is not correct in my opinion. With that said, we see companies that are spending millions of dollars a month on performance marketing channels like Google and Meta still, despite all the ups and downs that they have faced and they do so profitably.

(00:24:55):
And I think there's some really great examples of companies that have scaled in relatively recent times, almost exclusively through paid. Grammarly is a really good example of this. They have been good at solving for this problem that exists around understanding the cost per acquisition versus lifetime value, how sticky customers are, predicting how much revenue can come from a customer and backing out into therefore how much we can pay per click and per lead and so on and so forth. Athletic Greens is another good example. So Athletic Greens is actually a pretty old company. I think they've been around for 10 years. I think they have retail distribution. I think they have done a lot of the more classic marketing things that are important in terms of developing that channel mix. But I think the amplification of that brand really, really gained traction quite recently where now everybody knows what Athletic Greens is, and that's because they're buying loads of ads on TikTok. They're buying loads of ads on other social channels like Facebook. They're investing in podcasting partnerships. But this is all digital paid acquisition.

(00:26:07):
And so it had a wonderful effect on this really interesting business that they had already built. So yes, it's still doable. We still see people doing it, and I think that there's been a bit of a reckoning in the performance marketing industry pertaining to things like privacy and the changes that Apple made and people being very creeped out at how their data is being used rightfully so. And then obviously the economy in 2022, we had a terrible macroeconomic shift where interest rates rise and inflation's out of control. And so of course the first thing that people cut are typically marketing budgets and we see Facebook and Google and other ad channels directly suffering from that. So all of that said, these storms pass. And so when the economy improves, generally speaking, I imagine people will go back to trying to find as much inventory from a pay per click point of view that they can purchase as possible and figuring out the economics of how to do that.

Lenny (00:27:08):
I was definitely going to ask about that, and I love that you touched on it, just clearly a lot is changing in paid growth/performance marketing recently. You talked about the privacy stuff, you talked about COVID kind of shifted the way people spend and kind of dropped and then came back. So my question is who are you finding has the most success these days in performance marketing? And I will plant one seed, which from the examples you just shared, it feels like it's mostly companies that are very efficient. I think Grammarly, they're just super efficient as a business. And then I think Analytic Greens, they're a sponsor and their negotiations for sponsoring is just like, okay, here's the number that makes sense for them financially, and they're not going to go anywhere above that.

Jonathan Becker (00:27:49):
Yeah. Because they know, they understand how many impressions they'll get and on average what the quality of impression is and how many dollars they can put behind that before it has a cliff in terms of ROI.

Lenny (00:28:05):
Exactly. So broadly, who do you think is having the most success now with the changes and then generally, what should people know about what has changed in the past say year in the space of performance marketing?

Jonathan Becker (00:28:18):
I'm not going to really be able to point to this company is really getting it right and I think that you can do that, but it's like saying, a friend of mine who recently on Twitter tweeted this funny thing where he was like, this is the number that I used to win the lottery said every successful founder ever trying to give advice to other founders. And so in other words, just because they won the lottery doesn't mean you're going to be successful picking the same number.

(00:28:43):
To that extent, there is a bit of a playbook around modern day performance marketing, and that includes everything from really stringent and rigorous creative testing and thinking about that correctly to understanding the subjectivity of attribution and its strengths and weaknesses, doing a lot of work around validity of these campaigns. So really just the measurement and whatnot. Companies that can do those things and then understand their own marketing economics, in other words, quite basically how much can we afford to spend in acquiring a customer on any channel before that acquisition is no longer profitable. So really focusing on the profitability of the bottom line and not just break net growth, for instance. Companies that have those capabilities and see the world that way tend to be successful in performance marketing.

Lenny (00:29:39):
When you were giving your intro, you talked about how you initially started doing SEO, that's where you started, and then you moved to paid growth. Well, how do you think about those two investments as a founder trying to decide which direction to go? What would your advice be of spend your time here versus there if X, Y, Z?

Jonathan Becker (00:29:56):
When I'm asked a question of should we put money into organic search or paid search? My response is often that they're actually not mutually exclusive to one another. So it's a great idea to do both, and that backs into my strategy of diversification of channels. So don't build up exclusively in one area and create volatility within your marketing mix essentially. SEO is a wonderful marketing capability when it's built out correctly. I think the issues that you run into are cause and effect related. So one of the things that people really like about performance marketing theoretically is that we can spend a certain amount and then if we're modeling things correctly, we can essentially determine how much revenue is generated from the actions that we took. Finance teams love that, C-suite teams love that, they can build projections, they can budget around it. There's some degree of predictability around it if it's done properly.

(00:30:52):
Search engine optimization is different in that the attribution can be tough. It's difficult to determine whether ultimately the actions that you took contributed to a rise in organic traffic. You have to essentially correlate that. And the reason is because when you build clusters of content and it's grouped thematically and you're targeting buckets of keywords, whether they're long tail or head keywords, whatever it may be, you can publish all of that on your website. Google still has to crawl it. They run it through their analysis algorithm, which is comprised of 200 different signals, of which maybe 20 to 30 have been publicly disclosed. So it's a bit of a black box.

(00:31:37):
We don't really know ultimately what ROI comes off of that unless you're very sophisticated, like probably one of your other guests, Ethan, in terms of measurement. Whereas paid, the ROI is still a difficult problem to solve, but there was a lot more of a linear relationship as it relates to attribution. And so paid being tangible was the reason why I leaned heavily into paid and ultimately away from SEO. But I do think that if you do SEO properly, the payoffs are indisputable and it is certainly an important part of a modern media mix.

Lenny (00:32:18):
You mentioned this earlier, I've heard this more and more recently that one of the biggest levers these days in paid growth is around creatives. It's not tooling or smarter data, or you tell me if I'm wrong, but it's just getting better creatives. And so I'll let you actually explain, what are creatives? There's a term creatives that people outside the industry don't really necessarily get. And then broadly, what should people be doing to optimize the way they approach creatives?

Jonathan Becker (00:32:46):
Certainly. So when we say creative, we're referring to the assets that power typically visual programmatic or pay per click campaigns on social channels or display networks. And so literally the motion graphics ad that you see on Facebook, the user generated content that you see on TikTok or a static ad that you might see that has a pretty picture in it or whatever. And so I think that when we talk about creative as a big lever around efficiency and optimization, the underlying conversation there is that over time our industry has been heavily automated. So a lot of the levers so to speak around performance have been automated by Google and Facebook over the last seven to 10 years. That's because originally when you ran these campaigns, you needed to have a rocket scientist in front of them. It was so complicated and there were so many different things that you could get wrong, and their solution, the channels like the big tech company solution to this is figuring it out for you. So eventually Google wants you to say, hey, I'm Google, give me your credit card and I'll take care of everything else. Facebook-

Lenny (00:33:57):
And the URL to point people to, and then we'll do the rest.

Jonathan Becker (00:34:00):
Yeah. I don't know if that's a great idea for consumers, by the way. But in the meantime, there's certain things that have just been fully automated. In the context of creative, it's still one of these things that for now is not auto-generated in the world of AI and all the changes that we're seeing. Maybe that's something that will change. But for now, essentially creative directors and their teams are concepting and producing different types of assets. And so there's a bunch of problems that we typically see when people come to us. So number one, performance marketing and brand marketing in a lot of organizations are two different things. And the designers that occupy brand teams bandwidth and whatnot often don't have a sense of how paid acquisition works.

(00:34:48):
And so one of the pitfalls of working with certain companies or the mistake that they make is the design team will hand off a file full of random assets for paid acquisition without any sense of how the channel works. And what I mean by that is these days we're using the analogy, the classic analogy of the funnel to organize our thinking around creative assets. So you can think about this as generating intent at the top of funnel and capturing intent at the bottom of the funnel. When I think about an experience that I want a consumer to have on Facebook, audience targeting and creative, I think about us beginning a conversation at the top of funnel creatively with an audience, having that conversation change as we say different things, and the audience that we're targeting ultimately graduates through different behaviors on our website from one to another, and then ultimately it resulting in an end to the conversation where they take an action hopefully that the brand that we're working with is looking for.

(00:35:56):
And so there's a clear beginning, middle and end to that. And one of the major pitfalls that we see is that certain brands just dump one homogenous message into all of their targeting. You see the same ad over and over again. It creates banner blindness and it's a total lack of efficiency. The antidote to that is to have resources dedicated to paid and essentially iterate upon the creative assets themselves based on the data that we see coming from ad sets and campaigns in various channels. And so what that means is that you have to experiment. You have to take a bit of a scientific approach, although it's a bit of an art and a bit of a science. You have to try and isolate variables, maintain similar conditions across targeting, and then determine which style and feature of an ad performs best at which stage of the funnel versus which audience. And the results that we see are dramatically different from brand to brand. But if you are not undertaking rigorous testing in conjunction with how you are driving the iteration and design of your ads, then you will not make progress essentially.

Lenny (00:37:11):
Is there a specific example that comes to mind here as something we did that just dramatically changed the impact of a change to a creative? Or if you can't think of one, are there just specific tactics that you can suggest for people to improve the way they approach creatives?

Jonathan Becker (00:37:28):
Yeah. So I think from a testing point of view, let's say I was running ads on Meta, beneath the campaign level when I create a campaign, the structure that my testing might take would be that I would have an audience, a single audience at the ad set level, and then I would have two nearly identical creatives within that ad set. The only thing being different across those two creative assets is a single variable. So it might be the copy, it might be an image or whatnot. That allows us to isolate a lot of variables and really test into one singular change across two creative assets. There's a lot of nuance to this. So sometimes the ad-serving algorithms, even when we set up a test structurally in that way, we'll serve one ad a different number of impressions than the other ad, in which case we then have to say, what is a leveling factor that allows us to look at these two ads equally, even though one received dramatically more impressions than the other?

(00:38:31):
This becomes where it becomes subjective in terms of how you want to determine success. But a good example is looking at the click-through rate, which is essentially a ratio or a metric like impressions until conversion, which is a leveling metric that allows us to determine, even though in a scenario where two ads facing the same audience within the same campaign received different numbers of impressions, we can still measure the efficiency or effectiveness of one ad over the other using metrics like that. And so from a testing point of view, I think that this is one way that we might look at trying to assess ad performance so that we can gather learnings, send that back to a creative team and say, hey, it turns out that when this copy is used at this stage of the funnel, it converts 50% more frequently than this other copy.

(00:39:26):
So let's now take that copy, use it as our base copy and challenge it with a different type of copy and see if we can continually iterate and refine. So that's a very practical example of how ad creative testing might work on a channel like Meta. You asked for specific examples where we've seen an unlock. There's two that come to mind. Several years ago we realized that highly produced ads from brand teams, and there's nothing wrong with brand teams, we work with them all the time. They do amazing work. I think we're just trying to work as a singular unit as opposed to being fragmented. But a lot of the brand guidelines of different companies would end up yielding these highly polished assets. And when you launch those on Instagram back in the day or something like that, what we found is that they would always underperform next to user generated assets.

(00:40:23):
So a brand that essentially has an influencer in front of it that says, I tried this product, I love it, I'm filming this ad from my iPhone. Look, check it out. Here's the product, here's me, I'm better off for it. Whatever it is that they're talking about. The unpolished iPhone, mobile phone creative, suddenly we realized massively outperformed these other channels because there was an authenticity to it. And rather than the brands themselves saying, hey, trust us, our product is great, here's a third party essentially validating what is so great about these brands, basically. So I can't speak to specific clients because I'm not allowed to talk about the work that we've done in large part, but that would be one example. And another example is we worked with a furniture company several years ago, which scaled dramatically, but they were having difficulty early on thinking through how to scale social ads.

(00:41:21):
And so paid search worked really well for them. Social ads, again, they had these highly produced styled rooms and one of the owners had their dog in the office all the time, and so they have these models sitting on furniture or whatever it was, and they would take these beautiful styled shots of their furniture in a room and one of the art directors was like, put the dog on the couch and let's take some photos of dogs on furniture, which made it more playful and approachable. That one change resulted in a total unlock of their performance on paid social channels. It would double or triple the ROAS that we were seeing type thing. So it's these minute differences that you can test into that ultimately can drive performance.

Lenny (00:42:04):
That reminds me of Airbnb. The photography team found, and actually the photography team was initially including people in the photos of listings, and that was the [inaudible 00:42:16] images of listing photos. And it turns out when there's no people in the listing photo, much higher conversion. And the theory basically people don't want to see other random strangers in a place they're going to sleep, and that was not expected.

Jonathan Becker (00:42:29):
That's a really great example. And so the question becomes, as a company and as a brand, do you arrive at those learnings anecdotally by accident? Is it the brilliance of one person on the team that the whole brand is predicated upon in terms of performance? Or do you put a very rigorous structure around testing and the iteration of assets and how to determine whether something works over another thing that is a process that yields the outcomes that you're looking for? And so a lot of times with agencies, people talk to us about the obvious hard skills that we have, but the soft skills are around process that can be deployed, that can actually be the difference between being highly sophisticated or unsophisticated. Internal teams do this too, but that Airbnb example is a great illustration of how if you put the right testing in place, you can yield an outcome that becomes an unlock for performance.

Lenny (00:43:28):
Getting even more tactical with that idea of testing a bunch of creatives makes me think about a story from chatting with a guy from Wish who's had a growth at Wish about how they uploaded hundreds of variations. And I think Wish is the epitome of the opposite of brand highly polished ads or it's just the most ridiculous looking product with just banners and numbers and prices and crossouts and all kinds of stuff, just anything that would take to get people to click. Is there a tool or process that you can point people to to help them do this testing on creatives or is it mostly built into the existing tools now and there's nothing really fancy about it?

Jonathan Becker (00:44:04):
We get asked this a lot and I think there are tools for different types of functions that we undertake in the process of running paid acquisition for different brands, but these days most of the testing that we do is within the channels themselves. So Meta ads, Google Ads, I keep touching on those two specifically because they're the most advanced in my opinion. They're really powerful. The good news here is that you don't necessarily need some exotic tool to do sophisticated creative testing. You can do it in platform and you can use the structure that I just kind of outlined as a starting point.

Lenny (00:44:43):
You mentioned Google and Facebook. What is your take on TikTok and YouTube and maybe Snap? Do you recommend people go there and there's a big opportunity? Do you think it's overblown? Do you think people should just take Google and Facebook basically at this point? What's your general advice?

Jonathan Becker (00:44:59):
So when I say Google and I say Facebook, I'm talking about the Google ecosystem of channels inclusive of YouTube. And when I talk about Facebook, I'm talking about Facebook, Instagram, and probably eventually WhatsApp, which I think will probably launch ads later this year. With all that said, some interesting opportunities these days really exist on channels like Amazon and TikTok as well as a number of other challenger channels I think. Snap I'll talk a little bit less about because I think really there's just fewer and fewer people potentially using Snap. There's no knock on Snap. I use Snap, I like it a lot, but at the same time, most individuals or organizations tend to want to place ads where there's a lot of views and engagement and the king of this right now is definitely TikTok. And so TikTok faces its own set of challenges and arguably there is as much an opportunity there as a barrier at the moment.

(00:45:58):
I love TikTok. I'm a consumer of content on TikTok, not a producer of content on TikTok. Their ads platform kind of reminds me of where Facebook ads was like six, seven years ago. It's not super sophisticated and attribution is not great yet, but you can get cheap CPCs because there's just fewer organizations advertising there. Fewer companies have figured out how to make that work. And same thing with Amazon. Amazon is a bit of a bespoke channel. It doesn't work for a B2B SaaS company. It's more specific to D2C I would say. But essentially those channels are wonderful. They're not at the point yet where they're kind of ubiquitous. Every single advertiser that has ever worked with us I think in the last 10 years is for sure on Google. Everybody does that. And then the question is, what else can I invest money in with the expectation of profitability?

(00:46:53):
And so TikTok and Amazon, and even if I want to break out YouTube, they tend to be a little bit more specific and they definitely work, but not for everybody yet. And so the question becomes, will TikTok become as prominent as a social ads platform like Meta Ads? And we just don't know yet. What we see working very nicely on TikTok, by the way, are these founder led brands where the founder is the ambassador and they're doing those handheld videos with their iPhone. They're talking about the merits of the products that they make. They're talking about the problems that they solve. They are great at cultivating a following. Their content is highly engaging. Those types of organizations crush it. Also, companies that got really good at partnering with influencers. So we haven't talked about partner marketing that much, but affiliate marketing companies got into this early, and then influencer marketing networks are all over this. But essentially having these third parties be an ambassador for your brand in an authentic way, partnering with them, having them generate the content. And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems...

Jonathan Becker (00:48:00):
... And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems to work quite well.

Lenny (00:48:05):
Awesome, I love those bullet points of just what is likely to work on TikTok.

Jonathan Becker (00:48:05):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:48:09):
Just broadly, would you say TikTok advertising today is underrated, overrated, or just right?

Jonathan Becker (00:48:16):
If you are e-comm based, if you're wholesale, retail based, anything direct to consumer, you have to investigate TikTok and try and figure out whether there's a way of promoting your products there, basically. It's a massive, highly engaged audience with somewhat specific demographics. It's a very exciting opportunity. Other brands need to pay attention to this and figure out what their entry point is going to be. And just because the innovation hasn't happened for B2B SaaS yet on TikTok doesn't mean it won't. TikTok wants that to happen, and so the question becomes how. And so someone will unlock that, and they'll make a billion dollars because of it.

(00:48:59):
But I wouldn't recommend that channel to everybody yet, and at Thrive for instance, we don't have a huge amount of people coming to us yet saying, "Hey, I'm spending $750,000 a month on TikTok, can you help me?" Type thing. The other problem with TikTok is that it's extraordinarily creative, asset dependent, and heavy. And so you are launching net new assets several times per week, it is hard for creative teams and brands to produce that much content. It takes a machine, and that's expensive, and so that all factors into the cost of not only just the ad dollars, but the creative resourcing and investment that's required to power that. So it can be done in a more nimble manner if you're spending less, but you can't really get to a million dollars a month on TikTok without having a huge amount of creative being pushed to that channel.

Lenny (00:49:56):
Awesome, that's really good advice. I want to chat out about AI soon, just because I imagine that could help with some of these things. But you mentioned B2B SaaS, and I wanted to ask, I imagine Google is the primary channel for B2B SaaS, and if not, or if it is, where else do you find there's value in spending money to drive growth through B2B SaaS, which channels and ad networks?

Jonathan Becker (00:50:20):
So I'm agnostic here in terms of where people should be spending money. I see this world in terms of impressions and clicks, and does that conform to the marketing economics of a project that needs to be achieved in order for it to grow. It's less about where to place your money and how to think about the placement of those funds. And so the common mistake that we see as people build out a funnel, so to speak, for B2B lead gen projects, or B2C lead gen projects, is they'll be overly reliant on the first of a sequence of metrics that ultimately yields a sale.

(00:50:57):
So typically it's something like cost per lead, marketing qualified lead, sales accepted lead, there might be a couple more metrics there, and then eventually a sale occurs. And so that the thinking is that, okay, for sales to occur, I need more leads at the top of the funnel. The more leads I have, the more marketing qualified leads I'll get, the more sales accepted leads get, and ultimately the more opportunities there will be and the more revenue will generate.

(00:51:24):
And so if I think about this world of lead generation on performance marketing platforms as a function of cost per lead in that sense that I just described, then the tendency is always to want to drive down the cost per lead, thinking that that's the efficiency, I can get more cheaper leads and that will yield more revenue. When in fact it turns out that if you flip that conversation on its head and say, not all opportunities and sales are equal, and instead of focusing upfront on a cost per lead, I now want to focus on what is a high value customer, so the cost per lead is actually higher, but the ROI of targeting those people is also higher. And so to get the higher quality leads, it's not a function of CPL.

(00:52:15):
And so that is a very common pitfall that we see when people come to us. The antidote to this, it's interesting, so Thrive developed an ETL tool, an extract transfer load tool called Thrive Stack. It's not commercially available, but if you wanted a commercially available version of this, you can use something called Supermetrics. Basically Supermetrics is a data connector. There's a world of different data connectors out there, but it allows you to pipe, via an API, revenue data from your CRM into a third party database that can then be joined with data from the channel itself. You can build tables within a database and normalize them together in a manner where you can start to determine the relationship between, again, the audience that a particular cohort of opportunities came from and whether a sufficient degree of revenue is derived from those opportunities.

(00:53:08):
And then you can build upon that what is known as a lead scoring model, which allows you to bid in real time on the audiences that have a higher likelihood to convert to high revenue generating customers. And so the magic there, we talked a little bit about rates of return and instant gratification in the performance marketing world, lead generation inherently is a slow gratification process. And so the problem is that if my pipeline is full of opportunities that yield revenue in two months, six months, sometimes 12 months, how do I determine how heavily to bid on different leads today in order to predictively have an outcome where I'm maximizing revenue? And a lead scoring model basically solves for that.

Lenny (00:53:59):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming.

(00:54:20):
And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming using sticky notes, reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, dry ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research, to product roadmaps, to customer journey flows, to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro. com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:55:06):
You talked about attribution, and I thought this would be a great time to get into that. So the way I think about this is oftentimes the biggest challenge in driving growth isn't the actual work you do to drive growth, it's measuring what impact your work is having and understanding where dollars are spent effectively. And things are changing heavily in attribution land with privacy shifts and ATT and iOS 14.5.1, or maybe whatever the version was that came out that changed everything. And so my question is, what changed, is one, in terms of being able to do attribution. Maybe even explain what attribution means for folks that are just like, what the hell are you even talking about? And then finally, just what do you recommend people do now to do attribution well in this new environment?

Jonathan Becker (00:55:57):
Yeah, it's a really, really great and pertinent question in the industry, and it has a lot of focus on it now, but attribution has always been a conversation that's been very important. So just to kick things off, attribution essentially is how we determine the relationship between what we did and what happened. In the context of performance marketing this means what ads did we serve, what campaigns did we launch, and generally what was the revenue ultimately that was derived from these campaigns? And so there's a funny quote that I love, someone named John Wanamaker in 1919 said, "I know-"

Lenny (00:56:33):
I bet I'm going to guess what it is.

Jonathan Becker (00:56:34):
Do you want to guess?

Lenny (00:56:35):
It's, "Half my marketing dollars are wasted, I just don't know which half."

Jonathan Becker (00:56:41):
Exactly, I love that you knew that. He said this in 1919. The world was a very different place there, but oddly enough we still have these types of problems today and it's because the world of what I did and what happened because of what I did is very complicated. There's so many variables, some of which we know, and then some of which we don't know that we don't know, type thing. And so attribution, as it stands in our industry, is still an incredibly subjective art and somewhat of a science. It doesn't mean that it's impossible, and it doesn't mean that there aren't varying degrees of sophistication as it relates to attribution, but we're still in a place where we have to understand the business and its goals, and then start to work on an attribution model.

(00:57:32):
An attribution model is probably something that is never solved, but I'll give you a couple of examples. So number one around attribution, it's important to determine whether an organization, a company, a client, is focused on profitability or growth. Whether I use one attribution lens or another will drive those outcomes. And so these days, for a number of different reasons, you mentioned iOS 14.5, in addition to third party cookie deprecation, and whatnot.

(00:58:02):
There's no one way necessarily of approaching attribution. The most classic and commonly held version of attribution used to be a cookie-based form of attribution called last click attribution, meaning that the last click in the sequence of clicks that yielded a conversion would be attributed with all the revenue from that conversion. Other models in a cookie-based world involved first touch attribution, so it's actually the first click. So I launch an ad, it's in an audience that doesn't know about my service or my brand, and so the first click that I get should be given all the credit for that sale. And then there's multi-touch attribution, which can take several different forms, but essentially is saying it's not one way or the other of the two first versus last click options, it's somewhere in between. So I'm going to create a weighted attribution model where the first touch gets so much of the credit and the last touch gets so much of the credit.

(00:58:59):
This is very subjective, as you can see. I am essentially looking at my business model, determining what my goals are, and then I'm backing out into an attribution methodology that I think adheres to both the economics of my business and the capabilities of these platforms. And again, we live in a world where a single brand might do television advertising, they might buy media in magazines, they might buy billboards, they might get impressions from Facebook, they might do paid search, so there's a big argument over how to ultimately model this.

(00:59:34):
So there was something called an IDFA that Apple allowed advertisers to use, and essentially what that was, it literally means ID for advertisers, and it allowed Facebook, Google, and other advertisers, Snap, TikTok, whoever was essentially selling ads that were predicated on being displayed on a Apple mobile device or a desktop device, it allowed the advertiser to provide attribution metrics and certain types of customer match metric metrics in their own platforms. And so when Apple ultimately launches its privacy changes, I believe in mid-2021, overnight it allows users to say, "Well, I don't want to share that information, I'm not going to share my IDFA anymore." Or, "Yes, I do want to share my IDFA." And so what you see as a result of that is less of the core data that Facebook in particular would've required to make attribution more airtight and ultimately validate its advertising.

(01:00:43):
So because we can no longer validate attribution on Facebook as seamlessly, we are in a situation where we're not sure any longer which audiences to target, and we're not sure how to run all of our creative testing, and ultimately we can't even determine the degree of revenue that's coming from particular campaigns that we've launched, and whatnot. And so it created quite a stir in the world of attribution, which is obviously this core discussion to is it working or not? People want to answer John Wanamaker's question, but the modern methodology now is through a number of different approaches to validation.

(01:01:25):
So the cookie based attribution, which had been probably the most popular version of attribution in the 2010s, really up to this point, is now one of the ways that we would look at this, but we would also include things like various forms of statistical modeling, customer surveys, population surveys, there's a number of different ways to the same place here. Statistical modeling, by the way, one thing that's very popular these days, which I think was originally created in the 1950s, is a form of statistical modeling called media mix modeling. It's essentially regression analysis, and it is trying to determine the causal relationship between, again, what you did and what the effect was on revenue. That's very topical in the industry these days. If you're looking for a tool off the shelf that can help with this, Recast is something that I see people using. But a lot of organizations build these highly customized bespoke models that ultimately feed the algorithm inside of an MMM model in a customized manner.

Lenny (01:02:27):
What is it, or is there a recommendation of just like, hey, if you're trying to do attribution today, here's what you should do. Is there a clear, do this, piece of advice, or is it super personalized depending on what you're trying to do?

Jonathan Becker (01:02:42):
The advice is that there's no single source of truth. Anyone who claims that they are a single source of truth, whether it's an individual, a model that they've created, or a tool that they've created, is not being accurate. I believe that the approach that works to attribution is that it's an ongoing investigation and it never stops, and essentially what you're doing is looking for evidence that validates the outcome of your performance marketing campaigns one way or the other.

(01:03:12):
There have been plenty of incredibly sophisticated attribution models that we've helped build and invalidated with MMM or other types of tools that have indicated that the campaigns do not work. So I will repeat that, we, a very sophisticated organization, have stood up campaigns that we measure and ultimately determine do not work, and that is an important finding in terms of an organization's determination of whether they want to continually invest, take budget out of these channels, or invest into other areas.

Lenny (01:03:49):
Awesome. You mentioned a company called Recast. I don't think you knew this, but I'm actually an investor, and so obviously a big fan, so check it out. I don't know what the site is, recast.com maybe. I think if you Google Recast attribution, we'll also have a link in the show notes.

Jonathan Becker (01:04:02):
Cool. Yeah, they're working with a couple of our clients right now and it's interesting, I like their approach.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Yeah, they're basically, they're building the model as a SaaS tool to do attribution in a really clever way. Amazing. Okay, just a couple more questions, one is around AI, one is around agencies, and just how to start down this road. How has AI in any way impacted the work you're doing today, or the work of paid growth, performance marketing, and then where do you think this will go in the next few years?

Jonathan Becker (01:04:29):
Interestingly, and I think I alluded to this earlier, but our industry has been influenced by AI for over a decade. So Google, Facebook, even Microsoft, these are some of the organizations that historically have been at the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence, and their goal was always to automate as much as possible within these platforms. And so the effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. So we're actually, we have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic, it's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers, like some of the things that we've talked about, and less so the trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.

(01:05:19):
So I think if we are the canary in the coal mine for other industries, what will be interesting is I assume that if you work in an architecture office that you'll be doing less of the drafting, and it's already been a change that's occurred in those offices, but you'll be doing less of the drafting and more of this strategic problem solving around what kind of building is necessary for the client in this scenario, type thing.

(01:05:42):
And so on a practical level, though, some of these conversational AI models are very interesting for us in that when I think about creative testing, for instance, we can have ChatGPT come up with all kinds of variants of copy that we would not have necessarily thought of. It can do a lot of drafting of things like RFP responses, so we can feed ChatGPT 100 previous RFP responses that we've done and have it spit out net new responses to net new questions in a net new RFP, and it's like 80% good and still requires 10 hours of work to massage to the point where we can send it off to a client, but that replaces a week of work with five or six people that it would've previously taken.

Lenny (01:06:33):
And that's already happening today, you're saying?

Jonathan Becker (01:06:35):
That's happening now, literally right now, type thing, all of what I just said. And there's a lot of different ways that we are beginning to use AI to do more with less, basically. So that's how I see it influencing not just our industry, but other people's businesses as well.

Lenny (01:06:55):
That's amazing. So just to repeat what you said, your team now, because of ChatGPT is able to spend more time higher level, and leverage specifically ChatGPT to do this kind of, and RFPs are basically proposals, people are asking you to pitch to work with them, is that?

Jonathan Becker (01:06:55):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:12):
Okay, yeah.

Jonathan Becker (01:07:13):
Some of these AI-driven organizations that allow you to type in a prompt and it spits out an image, on our creative group we can come up with mockups in literally 1% of the time that it took. So you no longer have to draw the initial mockups for art. Suddenly what might have taken one person a week of work on a campaign takes an afternoon, type thing. You still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, "Do we like this more or do we like this more?" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.

Lenny (01:07:55):
What's the tool your team uses for that, is it MidJourney or Dall-E or something else?

Jonathan Becker (01:08:00):
It's Dall-E and it's MidJourney, so you got it.

Lenny (01:08:03):
Got it. And so what you use it for is you're thinking about a concept and you just come up with a mock, coming up with a prompt to pitch what this could be.

Jonathan Becker (01:08:11):
Yeah, the interesting thing there is that these concepts often live inside of someone's head, and we do this thing as humans where we verbally discuss it, and I try and put the image in my mind's eye, in your mind's eye, which is an inherently inefficient process and actually hurts our ability to be creative leaders. Someone might just see it slightly differently than you do. Now that person theoretically can use Dall-E to output what is inside their head, and they can refine that easily through subsequent prompts in Dall-E or MidJourney, or whatever it may be, and then just say, "Do you like this? This is my idea." And so in a way it's helped humans connect more easily in that context than we were capable of doing before, and then in the context of pitching a client on ideas, we are capable of generating more ideas faster and iterating upon them live. So I can have a Zoom call with you, I can present my screen, and if you don't like the output of Dall-E that I just prompted, I can re-prompt based on your feedback in real time.

Lenny (01:09:16):
There's this sentiment that AIs going to take away the fun stuff of jobs, like maybe being creative and coming up with a new concept and photography, setting up a whole photo shoot, whatever.

Jonathan Becker (01:09:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:30):
Do you find that your team is excited about uploading this to Dall-E, or are they just like, goddammit, this is what I loved, and now I'm just sitting around in docs writing prompts.

Jonathan Becker (01:09:40):
I am not an incredible artist, but now I can take those thoughts in my mind and output them just as well as someone who's pretty skilled in artwork. So in a sense, I'm excited because this technology democratizes the ability to do this across everyone. Anyone who can think a thought can generate an image on an AI image generator. How many scribes do you know?

Lenny (01:10:04):
Zero, I believe zero.

Jonathan Becker (01:10:06):
Because we invented something called the printing press, and the printing press took over what was a cottage industry for very specific individuals that allowed them to control the flow of information. Yet today it's not like we have fewer writers or creative thinkers, they're just using different tools to arrive at the same place. You could say the same thing of the loom. There used to be people who would stitch your T-shirt together, or your sweater together, and none of those people have work anymore. There's still people who knit, I suppose. But your clothes are made in factories with machines, and the quality of the clothing is arguably a lot better than it was, maybe I'm wrong about that point, but you can make more of it and more sophisticated clothing.

(01:10:46):
There's no question that AI is going to displace and replace certain industries of people, certain roles. I'm not going to pretend like I know whether that's a good or bad thing, and I'm also not a poster child for AI, I am really just using the technology that's available to us to run our business the best way we can. We haven't let anybody go yet because of these efficiencies. The people who used to do the artwork are the ones using these tools, and I think they're excited that they're more productive. Is there going to be nuance around that? Of course. Are some people going to be sad about the changes? Yes. I think human nature is that people generally don't like change, but I think over time we've seen change has been a productive and positive thing for society, not a negative thing.

Lenny (01:11:35):
Awesome. Yeah, so it sounds like the team is excited, generally, and that's a good sign, and that's what I find generally. I think some people will be really upset, but most people will be like, amazing, and they never wanted to do this part.

Jonathan Becker (01:11:47):
This generation of people will be upset, and then there will be a subsequent generation that never knew anything different. So the way that I think about this is the people growing up these days have always had the internet, whereas you and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI-

Jonathan Becker (01:12:00):
You and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI is a platform like the internet and just as when the internet was launched, you couldn't conceive of amazon.com or all of these wonderful or social networks or whatever it was. The permutations of what AI will become, even in the current GPT 4 context or Dolly context or whatever it may be. We don't know what people are going to create with this and so it's difficult for the generation that knew what life was like beforehand, before iPhone, before internet, before AI, but there will be people who know nothing but this eventually, and to them it'll just be normal.

Lenny (01:12:42):
Until we're all just replaced by AI and then it's AI writing ads to get other AI tools to buy products from each other.

Jonathan Becker (01:12:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:12:49):
And then we're just sitting around watching Netflix and that'll be great. There's always this question when you're starting to invest in paid growth, performance marketing of should we work at an agency? Should we work? Should we hire someone junior to figure it out? Should we hire someone senior?

Jonathan Becker (01:13:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:13:03):
What's your general advice for, say, an early stage startup when it makes sense to work with an agency versus bringing someone in-house?

Jonathan Becker (01:13:12):
Mm-hmm. We need people in-house to do our jobs properly. Agencies are not mutually exclusive to personnel in-house. If we don't have a point of contact, for instance, at an earlier stage company and we're supposed to report to the CEO, CEOs tend to be very busy people and we often just can't get the information and approvals that we need to be successful. If you think that growth marketing is an opportunity and that performance marketing is a subset of growth marketing that you want some focus on, the reality is you're going to need expertise and you probably should start in-house and then hire an agency.

(01:13:49):
Again, there's different stages of companies and different examples of what makes sense at different stages and the nature of the work that we do at different stages changes. Very, very late stage, we're kind of doing a lot of this sophisticated production work. We're implementing sophisticated testing, we're working on attribution, we're building beautiful reporting, but in a sense, we're maintaining this machine that already exists. Earlier stage, we're doing a lot more of net new experimentation, trying to discover what is working and what sequence of audience targeting versus creative asset display will work, what channel mix works, and all of that. A lot of times the body of work that's required to nail that and the inputs to literally out front what questions to be asking isn't something that a small in-house team possesses and so they will work with an agency to scale faster, to get where they're going quicker, to bring in more resources quickly, basically. Then later stage, sometimes it's a permutation of the same thing or we're really just managing a whole bunch of different capabilities that they have because it's very complicated and difficult to staff.

Lenny (01:15:05):
That is really interesting. So it's not like agency versus in-house full-time person. It's you need both is what you're finding.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:11):
I don't think we have any projects that we're working on where there's not a professional marketing person as our POC and generally the people that we report to have a background in what we do, whether they ended up doing something different and now they're a VP or a director level and not directly managing channels themselves is one thing or another. But yeah, we work with people that have in-house expertise all day long.

Lenny (01:15:35):
I see. Sometimes it could just be a generalist marketing person that becomes your point of contact.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:15:39):
They don't have to be experienced in paper.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:41):
There's one more thing. As agencies, we're constantly solving people's problems in the market and as a result of that, I have a fairly large team of 130 people that think about performance marketing all day long. It's the first thing we think about when we have our morning coffee and it's the last thing we think about as we're leaving the office kind of thing. We have very sophisticated and built out capabilities as well as all kinds of software and processes and capabilities, I guess, that we've created that most in-house teams just don't have because they're smaller or newer or someone might be really sophisticated but they don't have the resources to implement it and stuff. In the same way that a really sophisticated organization might go to Boston Consulting Group or McKenzie to say, "Hey, we did this, but you do more of this all day long and we need advice on how to be more efficient," people come to Thrive saying, "Hey, we're top of our game. We have really strong people. They absolutely know what they're doing," which is always the case by the way, "But we're looking for extra sophistication and additional capabilities that are very difficult to create in an in-house organization." It's why we worked with Uber for 10 years. It was tough to replace us.

Lenny (01:16:59):
Yeah, that's quite the retention. 10 years, 10 years going, I imagine our net dollar retention has gone up too.

Jonathan Becker (01:17:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:17:09):
When you're looking to hire someone full-time to drive the paid growth channel and/or work with an agency, what do you recommend people look for specifically, especially things maybe they're not likely to think about when they're hiring someone that people often miss?

Jonathan Becker (01:17:26):
There's a couple of competencies that I think are very important. I found that, so I was a nerd as a child, if you can't tell, I don't know.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Nope.

Jonathan Becker (01:17:35):
Super nerdy, geeky kid. I would take apart-

Lenny (01:17:38):
[inaudible 01:17:38].

Jonathan Becker (01:17:39):
I would take apart my parents' computers, I'd try and rebuild them. I was fooling around with bulletin boards before websites existed, stuff like that. Then I became a web developer and as I transitioned into a performance marketing role, I realized that being technical and having technical aptitudes was extraordinarily helpful in terms of being on the front line of what we were doing and solving problems. If you're making your first hire, you probably want them to have the ingenuity and capability to solve a lot of the problems that you're going to run into within the context of tracking, attribution, data visualization, and then campaign management. Number one, do they have a technical background? That can be multidisciplinary.

(01:18:22):
At Thrive, we have someone who is a nuclear physicist that left discipline and became a performance marketer. We have people who have left mathematics and become performance marketers, people who left finance, full stack engineering, all kinds of stuff. Those are technical fields where people tend to be good at math and good at problem solving, and so that's a strong piece of evidence that they might have a strong aptitude for performance marketing and managing this.

(01:18:52):
Another thing is just literally do they have experience in this discipline? Have they managed on any level Meta ads, Google ads, TikTok, Amazon, some of the things we talked about? Do they have an appreciation for some of the inputs that we just discussed today that ultimately create the conditions for success within a performance marketing environment? Do they understand the role of creative? Do they understand the role of proper attribution and are they capable of understanding the mechanics of your business and so on and so forth?

(01:19:29):
I would say just fundamentally, those are some of the areas that when we are interviewing we're looking for. As an agency too, we are looking for the ability to work with people and be excellent at client services. One of the questions we might ask, I actually borrowed a Jeff Bezos question from early stage Amazon where I asked people without much warning in an interview, I'll ask them whether it's okay to do a bit of a thought experiment together and whether they are comfortable responding to a logic question. I'll ask the question of, "How many windows are there in New York City?" There's two things that I look for in this scenario. One is can they think on their feet? I'm not actually looking for the correct answer. It's a pretty difficult question to solve. But number one, do you realize that windows are not just building windows and windows are also in cars and trucks and stuff like that, so there's more than one type of window. Then can you just do the arithmetic of saying there's so many buildings per hectare or square mile or whatever it is and it's division multiplication type stuff.

(01:20:33):
But also from a client services point of view, I'm trying to see whether in a scenario where I've asked them something that they obviously probably weren't prepared for, that is a strange thing to ask and probably makes them feel a little bit uncomfortable, how they react in that situation. Do they remain composed or do they lose their composure and get frustrated or even angry that I asked them something that's pretty weird to ask? Their reaction there is often a good leading indicator of whether or not in a client scenario working with our clients, they can compose themselves in a difficult situation.

Lenny (01:21:10):
Very tactically, what level of experience do you recommend people look for in their first performance marketing hire year or two, four or five years, longer?

Jonathan Becker (01:21:23):
I've seen people who have 10 years of experience in the industry not be that great and then I've seen people who have one year of experience be absolutely phenomenal. I would say that again, the years of service under their belt is one clue or piece of evidence to their potential aptitude. But really, you want someone who can clearly demonstrate to you that they can competently run the channels I suppose. If what you're asking is literally at the level where someone is managing pay per click and programmatic media buying, then you want to make sure that they can just do that and I would say it's less about the years of experience. A lot of times people only want to do those types of jobs for a couple years before they're like, "Hey, what's your plan for me? I'm tired of running ads and building campaigns. I want to manage the people who do that now." The people who tend to really do that are often somewhat earlier on in their careers. That's just a reality that we see.

Lenny (01:22:25):
One more very technical question. What do you recommend the title for this role be? Growth marketer, something else?

Jonathan Becker (01:22:31):
I've seen so many different names for this. I think again, if the intention is to grow out a growth marketing capability, which again is not exclusive to performance marketing, then you're looking for a manager role of growth marketing manager. I've seen paid acquisition specialist for people who just manage channels. I've seen paid acquisition manager, performance marketing manager, media planner and buyer. I've seen all kinds of different roles. But when we are launching a new role these days, there's such wonderful tools like everything from Glassdoor to LinkedIn to PayScale where you can essentially just look at what other people are calling it and borrow from their role descriptions and then create your own role description and then determine what role is meaningful in the context of your own organization.

Lenny (01:23:23):
Awesome. Last question. We started with the story of how you landed Uber, and I know you also have an interesting story which I haven't heard of how you landed Snap/Snapchat as a client, so maybe tell that story.

Jonathan Becker (01:23:38):
It's a fun story and I think it's about ultimately confidence and knowing your craft. I believe it was like 2015 or 2016, we were essentially contacted to participate in an RFP down in Los Angeles. RFPs are difficult processes and essentially a department of a company is saying, "We want performance marketing and here are all the questions that we're going to ask you and exercises you need to complete in order to vet you as to whether you are the right partner or not." Sometimes RFPs are incredibly thoughtful and they're run by people who have either done a lot of RFPs in the context of what we do or they know specifically what the outcome is. Then in other cases, they're very experienced marketing departments with senior people and an approach that they may take is every stakeholder within that department gets to submit one or two questions to a long list of questions and the respondents have to respond to all of this.

(01:24:38):
The RFP process for Snap was somewhat complex and they asked a range of different questions and we find ourselves in LA at a hotel the night before, it's 2:00 in the morning, my business partner and another team member that we had brought down are sweating and we're like, "How are we going to build a presentation out of this? They're asking so many well-meaning but difficult questions that are zigging and zagging." In a pitch situation you want to tell a story, it's important, and that story has to have a beginning, middle, and end. It was just difficult and yet here we were and we had worked with all these really cool organizations and I was very confident that we knew precisely what we were doing. I kind of had this eureka moment where I was like, "Here's what we're going to do." It was Brent MacArthur, my business partner and I kind of arrived at this together, but we're kind of like, "Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have a completely unique take on how to respond to this and we're going to build a deck that's bespoke around X, Y, and Z."

(01:25:54):
We work till 6:00 in the morning, I think we get a couple hours of sleep and then by 10:00, we're sitting in their offices. Essentially the pitch is something like this. I stand there in front of about 20 different executives from their organization and I say, "You have thoughtfully curated an RFP for us to respond to today, and you have asked us to respond to about 20 to 30 different questions. With the utmost respect, I am not going to answer any of your questions today. I'm standing here because you are looking for a marketing partner and you need expertise in this area and instead of telling you the answers to the questions that you asked, I'm going to tell you what I think you need to do to get where you want to go and if you agree with me and my logic and what I talk to you about here today, then you should hire us. If you do not agree with my logic and you think that we're out to lunch, then you should not hire us."

(01:26:47):
You could hear a pin drop in the room. My own team I think was a little bit surprised. We had a whole bunch of technical difficulties that day. Someone who was supposed to Zoom in couldn't make it and so I have to ad lib part of the pitch that I wasn't prepared for, lots of zig and zags. They thank us for RFP response, lots of handshakes and smiling faces, but we don't know whether we're going to land the client or not.

(01:27:12):
Then about two hours later, I was driving to San Francisco with a friend, immediately leave LA for SF because I had a bunch of follow on meetings, and I get a phone call and they were like, "We loved your approach. Congratulations. You're hired."

(01:27:28):
These days I think Snap is still a really interesting organization, but at the time they were kind of bringing the future of a social platform or what a social platform could be in the same way that we think about TikTok right now. TikTok wasn't on the scene yet and Facebook was very worried about Snap and there was tons of engagement on Snap, so this was the it client of the day and it felt amazing.

(01:27:55):
Essentially the lesson was that you have to trust yourself and understand your strengths and weaknesses. In situations where someone is well-meaning but may not understand what they need, be brave and tell them what they need rather than just conforming to what they're asking for because sometimes inadvertently that leads you down the wrong path. We took a big risk and it had a wonderful payoff and we have, in addition to this story, we had a wonderful relationship with them for a couple years.

Lenny (01:28:28):
I love that story. I love how dramatic all your new customers, your way of acquiring customers and I imagine not all of them are this dramatic.

Jonathan Becker (01:28:38):
Not all of them are this dramatic, but there have been some pretty dramatic ones. I think part of running a business and running an agency has been the curation and experience around all these fun, crazy stories that have accumulated as we run this really interesting services business.

Lenny (01:28:55):
Awesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for the lightning round?

Jonathan Becker (01:29:03):
I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:29:05):
Okay, great Looking, very excited. Okay, first question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jonathan Becker (01:29:13):
As a marketer, Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks is a wonderful book. He is a world world-class storyteller. I don't know if you know him. He wrote this book about how to structure and think about the art of storytelling and every marketer should read Storyworthy. It was a huge contributor to how I think about what we do at Thrive. As an entrepreneur, I love startup stories, so Shoe Dog, which is the startup story of Nike. It's basically Phil Knight talking about all the ups and downs, and it's crazy. Nike shouldn't be a company based on all the turmoil and challenges that they overcame. Fascinating read about taking risk and doing what you think is right and ultimately succeeding and building Nike. Then a book by Nick Bilton called American Kingpin, which is the story of the startup of the Silk Road, which was like this dark web marketplace for some pretty bad stuff. But it is half tech story, startup story and half gangster kind of kingpin story. It honestly should be a Hollywood movie. It reads like a Hollywood thriller. So awesome, great book.

Lenny (01:30:30):
Favorite recent movie or a TV show.

Jonathan Becker (01:30:32):
I don't know how recent it is, but I love The Big Short, just love it.

Lenny (01:30:35):
Not recent at all, but it's still great.

Jonathan Becker (01:30:37):
It's still great. The reason why I like it is because someone found truth in the data they were analyzing and then capitalized on it, which is really an analog for what we do in performance marketing. Then recently I have fallen in love with White Lotus for no particular reason. It's just raw entertainment.

Lenny (01:30:54):
What's something you've changed in the way that you all operate that's been relatively minor in terms of how hard it was to change, but that had a tremendous impact on your ability to execute as a team or a company?

Jonathan Becker (01:31:08):
The tools that we use in performance marketing change constantly. The channels themselves change and therefore what problems exist and what SaaS companies or different types of platforms offer as solutions to problems change. I don't think it's one thing necessarily, this might be a bit of a roundabout answer here, but I mentioned that change itself earlier is something that humans seem to not love, whereas in our industry, and I don't think we're alone here, but there's a culture of change. A welcoming of change, aptitude around change, having a playful mindset with new technology and tools rather than being upset about the fact that AI exists or third party cookies are being deprecated or iOS 14 removed IDFA and trying to be creative around those types of solutions has been like a constant for us. I'm kind of sidestepping the question a little bit, but it is the cultural willingness to adapt that I think has been a strong suit for us as a company.

Lenny (01:32:12):
Speaking of tools, final question. What is your favorite most underrated tool for performance marketing work?

Jonathan Becker (01:32:18):
It's Thrive Stack. It's a tool that we built in-house that allows us to pipe third party data and anonymized customer level data into a database and then ultimately visualize it in a format like Data Studio, Google Data Studio, which I think now is called Looker Studio. That has been a profoundly powerful platform from which we're capable of delivering insights that are built upon the data as opposed to just regurgitated data, if that makes sense. We have not released this technology yet. It's basically a tool we use in-house with our clients. But to a certain extent, I mentioned Supermetrics, which is another ETL and has some of the same capabilities but isn't quite as powerful.

Lenny (01:33:05):
Amazing. Jonathan, this is by far the deepest I've ever gone into the world of paid growth. I really appreciate you making time and sharing all of your wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask some questions maybe, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jonathan Becker (01:33:23):
Thank you for having me again, by the way. This was a lot of fun. I'm available through Thrive, so thrivedigital.com. You can contact us through our site by accessing the contact form. Personally, I'm on LinkedIn under my name Jonathan Becker or Twitter, JZBecker. Then things that would be interesting from the audience, always looking for feedback in terms of whether people agree or disagree with thoughts and feelings that we have about what we do. Obviously always looking for amazing people ultimately to join our team at Thrive. If you're a practitioner of growth marketing or performance marketing and you're looking for a top place to spend some time, would love to talk to you. Also, I suppose if you need some help making this stuff work within the context of your own organization, we'd love to be at your service.

Lenny (01:34:12):
Awesome. What is the URL again?

Jonathan Becker (01:34:14):

# How a great founder becomes a great CEO | Jonathan Lowenhar (co-founder of Enjoy The Work)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work. I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:11):
To be a founder is a state of being, it's an attitude. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:30):
Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot. It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):
Something you talk about, there's these two phases to a startup journey and most people focus on the first phase.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:51):
Phase one is build something people want to buy. Phase two, the one we don't talk about is now you have to build a company around that thing people want to buy. Building a company is always the same. I don't care if it's MedTech or fintech or hardware or consumer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
You've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box paradigm that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long-term.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:01:11):
This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you, you ping them and you hope you get a deal. Magic Box argues that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. They see the fantasy, they fall in love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Today, my guest is Jonathan Lowenhar. Jonathan runs a firm called Enjoy The Work, which I've heard amazing things about from so many people over the years. Their firm has a singular mission, to help founders become great CEOs. They do this through a blend of mentoring and advising services, which are rooted in their study of how the best startups operate. They take these lessons and fold them into frameworks and advice and training that they offer their CEOs, their insight, which you'll hear in our conversation, is that most founders don't come into the job knowing how to be a CEO, which includes learning how to do hiring, how to manage financials, figure out growth strategy, road mapping, planning, people management, and so many other skills that nobody teaches a founder.

(00:02:16):
In our conversation, Jonathan shares the most common CEO failure modes that he and his team have seen, the Magic Box paradigm for successfully selling your startup, a bunch of advice for finding and hiring the best talent, a framework for building a repeatable go-to-market motion, why and how you should learn to trust your intuition more as a founder and so much more. We could have gone on for so many more hours. Maybe he'll be back to share more advice. If you're a founder or hope to be a founder one day, this episode is for you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jonathan Lowenhar. Jonathan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast,

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:03):
Lenny, I am damn excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:05):
So am I. The reason I'm excited to have you in this podcast is that you basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, what causes them pain, what causes them to fail, what causes them to struggle, and then you take that and you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work with founders, and I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain? How do I avoid these things that I'm going to probably run into? To build on that, briefly, can you just help people understand what it is you do, what it is your organization does with founders, how you work with founders?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:38):
Yeah, thank you. I'll tell a bit of origin story that I think ends up answering that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):
Let's do it.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:45):
I had run a bunch of different types of companies and they were really different ones. I ran a big division for a public company, then I was a private equity CEO, then I did back-to-back startups. The first one didn't get very far, but we sold it, and the second one got really far. When I left the second one, I was like many founders, grossly unhealthy, 25 pounds overweight, wasn't sleeping enough, all the things. I took a few months to get healthy and then reflect on those parts of my career. One of the things that I noticed at the time was all of those companies, when they got to a good place, when they started to run well, they were all run well in the same way. How could this be? How could public company, private equity, startups, early stage, growth stage, when they were run well, they were all run well the same way?

(00:04:35):
I started to obsess about this question, and what it led me to realize is that every well-run company has a rhythm. It's unmistakable, you can't miss it. You can't not see it. You just spend a couple of days through a spy cam watching a business, you'll see the pattern. How come some startups get there and some don't? How does a founder learn the rhythm? How do they learn how to run a company well? I started to ask investors obsessively, and I asked them, Lenny, I asked them all three questions, same three over and over and over again.

(00:05:14):
First question was, well, describe to me your ideal founder. What's a great founder? The answers universally were the same. Investors would use words that meant grit and tenacity and courage and insight, and I'd say, "Great. Question number two, describe to me a great startup CEO," and they use none of those words. How can that possibly be true? Instead, they describe skills. This is a person who knows how to build stuff and sell stuff and recruit people and raise capital and organize humans and financially plan. Question number three, my final one, well, how does a founder learn those skills while doing the job? I got blank fucking stares, over and over again. It led me down this path that I'm now 10 years into with my colleagues of, well, how do we help founders learn those skills so that their venture investors don't fire them, so that they can actually go build whatever company they want to build and stay in the job for as long as they want to stay in the job? That's origin, that's what got me going.

Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:07:57):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:59):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:08:15):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:37):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever?

Christina Gilbert (00:08:48):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's OneSchema.co. There's obviously this new meme of founder mode. I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode. You basically have to be good at both. This latter part is almost manager mode. Is that a way to think about it?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:09:34):
Yes. Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
Do share.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:09:42):
It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. If we think about an ascending startup, there's this phase of I have to invent something. I now have to figure out how to get my customer in front of this invention and see if it works, and then I have to build a business model around that to see if there's some repeatable way to attract, win, deploy my customer and thrill them with whatever the solution is. Okay, now I have to go build an enormous amount of demand and then I have to build up an operation that can handle all that demand. Oh, and by the way, at some point, figure out how to turn positive revenues into positive cash flows. The idea that the founder who's writing code by themselves doesn't have to advance their skills to learn how to do all those things, and that in fact what the article even implies is learning how to do those other things is a negative is bananas to me.

(00:10:52):
The things required to launch a company are not the same as grow a company as scale a company as exit a company, and the best startup CEOs learn them all along the way. There are lots of ways to learn them. I'm not suggesting there's only one path, but founder mode was almost an excuse not to. I do think what's unique about a founder that felt perhaps where that article was trying to go is that unlike the professional mercenary CEO that gets dropped in, the founder knows everything about what built this company and they can drop in at the most granular level and play anywhere. They can drop into a product feature, they can drop into a customer conversation or a partner conversation or with a long-time employee that's still in IC and be impactful and then rise back up if they've gone the training and get back into a cockpit to run the company again. That's to me the distinction. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
I love that. I'm glad we got there. I wasn't planning to talk about founder mode, but I think this is really helpful for folks to hear that are founders and people working for founders too. Along these same lines, you have a really helpful and really funny also mental model for how to think about common failure modes of founders. You have these labels that I love, and this is actually the first thing I heard about Enjoy The Work is these labels that you guys use, and you also, a similar mental model for failure modes for a startup. Can you just share these modes that you've come up with?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:12:31):
We do take a bit of a comical approach to some of this. As I've shared with you previously, the name of our company is not an accident. If we can't be playful, we can take the work seriously and not ourselves, so we do fuck around quite a bit. I think if I would separate failure modes for companies versus CEOs for a minute, the company ones are not quite as comedic, but they are ones we see all the time. One is you chose the wrong market. I don't think we need to belabor that one. Lots of your prior guests have talked about the importance of getting that part right or nothing else really matters.

(00:13:05):
Second, back to what we were discussing a minute ago, build something people want to buy, got to go build the right thing. Cool. Third one, founder's function. We like to joke that more companies die from suicide than homicide, and it's grim, but also if the two or three people in charge of the business can't get along, nothing else matters. It's all going to break apart. Then fourth, execution, and execution now leads back to CEO. Okay, so now we have a bunch of playful ones here. We have the robot CEO, who believes emotion should not ever exist at a startup, at which point we train them on a very simple formula. Emotions are messy, humans have emotions, startups need humans, therefore startups are messy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
I love how engineering-oriented that advice is, which makes sense for robots. Yeah.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:14:03):
Also, a little bit more graceful of an answer there is also our CEOs want urgency and passion and excitement from their teams. They want them working enormously hard for below market comp more often than not with this promise of equity that might return value five or 10 or 12 years later. They want them to bring all of that emotion, but they're supposed to figure out how to surgically cut off the emotions that are inconvenient. That's the robot CEO who believes that we can just have several robots working for us and you just press a button and they do a thing. Second one is a pleaser CEO. This is the person who is far more concerned with being liked than running a business, so they can't tell anyone hard news. They can't break ties, they want a consensus on everything, and that's not possible.

(00:14:56):
If you have a group of thoughtful people working for you, they're going to fight, they're going to debate and you want them to. Then at some point you have to call it and say, "No, we're going left not right." Or, "The two of you need to go get in a room and deal with something." Or, "Hey, the way you just showed up is not the way I want you to show up." The pleaser CEO won't do any of that. They will simply hide and pray It goes away and it won't go away. Next one is a perfectionist CEO. I'd like to say that these are the CEOs with the most beautiful product to be delivered minutes before they file for bankruptcy. This is the person who is far more concerned with being right and believing that there's always a right answer than just moving forward.

(00:15:36):
It creates two problems in a business. One is you're just slow and the other one is you'll never take any bets because you will build a team that realizes the CEO is not allowed to be wrong, so you can't disagree, you can't use intuition, you can't use gut. Everything has to be utterly factual and that is simply not possible. In early-stage startups, you have more questions than you do answers. Everything is circumstantial. It's not like watching CSI entrepreneurship and you get to see a video to say, "Oh, look, the guy did it." No, we have a bunch of little data points you have to come to a conclusion. The next one is the angry CEO.

(00:16:15):
I had a founder of mine a bunch of years ago and we were seeing a pattern across the leadership team and he and I get on the phone one morning and I said, "I have a theory for you. It might be a story, I might be wrong, but I want to share." He said, " Okay." I said, "I think you wake up in the morning angry and you don't know it, and then you get to the office and you beat the crap out of the first employee that crosses paths with you over something utterly unrelated because you're angry. You realize that a few hours later and you apologize and your team hasn't quit yet because they believe you're a good human who doesn't have good self-control." Then I shared with him, "And you just had your first child. My guess is because I'm not a psychologist, I'm not a therapist, that you are modeling something that's happened in your life. Is this something you want to change?"

(00:17:09):
His answer is yes, and I said, "Great. I have good news and bad news. The good news is because you said yes, we can do something about it, and the bad news is I don't know what to fucking do. That's not my job." The point being, no one wants to work for the angry person. I don't care what the equity potential is worth, no one wants to work for that person, and the moment they see greener pastures elsewhere, they're leaving. The next one is the one that drives me particularly crazy, it's the laissez-faire CEO, who insanely believes that I can just hire great people and utterly ignore them and let markets take care of themselves and they will do all the right things. I have never met anyone, Lenny, that didn't benefit from good management and the laissez-faire CEO believes that management is not required, and so what they ultimately find is they have really, really good people doing utterly disconnected things and goals are not achieved.

(00:17:59):
Every CEO we can reductively reduce to one of two characters. They're either comfortable with the brake or comfortable with the accelerator. The challenge with those who are comfortable with the brake, what I mean by that is they don't want to spend any money, so they're driving this beautiful sports car and they're just leaning on the brake the whole time. Yes, they won't run any money, and yes, they will also get lapped by everyone else and miss the opportunity. Where their opportunity is, is where can you take bets? Where can you actually downshift that car in such a way where you give yourself a chance in the market? Separate, those who ride the accelerator, we've all met this one. They're going to run out of money really fast, and this connects to one of our other challenging CEO types, the ready, fire, aim.

(00:18:49):
Most CEOs are really bad at planning and that's because there's this little-known secret in the Bay area, most CEOs have never run a business before. Planning doesn't have to be some heavy bureaucratic multi-month exercise that begins in August and ends in February, but a little bit of bottoms up planning to say, what are we trying to achieve? How do we quantify it? What resources are required? What humans are going to do what? How do we shorten feedback loops so we know in a week, in a month and two months, whether we're on the right trajectory? The ready, fire, aim CEO says, "I don't want to do any of that because they're improvisational and they just want to take bets and they want to take shots," and that's what got the company started, and that's also what will have the company go bankrupt. The micromanager one is the opposite of laissez-faire. They believe that no matter how many employees they have, they can do the job better.

(00:19:42):
The challenge with this one is it is massively disrespectful to those who work for you. We think that, and this is a bit insulting, that everyone that works for a founder can be fit into one or two chunks. They're either an adult or a child. I have a three-year-old, my little girl is amazing. I'm utterly in love. If she doesn't have a lot of structure and a lot of supervision, she's going to run into things, man. Into things, off things, through things, but adults don't need to be given utter instruction and watched all the time. In fact, it needs to be the opposite. We agree on what success is, what resources are, and you let them go and they'll come back to you when they have questions. The micromanager CEO doesn't see the difference between those two humans. They don't trust anybody and that's actually the thing under the thing under the thing, so they want to do everyone's work and that will succeed right up into the point everyone quits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:39):
This is amazing. Okay, so let me recap these labels that you have just for folks. I have them written down here. There's the robot CEO, perfectionist CEO, pleaser CEO, micromanager, laissez-faire, ready, fire, aim, riding the brake and then riding the gas, and as you said, the ever-popular angry CEO.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:21:03):
You got them all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):
As people hear this, I imagine people self-identify a few of these, like I have some of this, I have some of that, and it's not like black or white. No one is like, "I'm a 100% robot CEO, and I need to fix that." It's like a pie chart kind of, I don't know, what's a visual of this? Everyone's got a little bit of this, basically.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:21:24):
That's right. I enjoy giving this talk on stage and watching different founders in the audience cringe at different moments, but it doesn't mean that they're all one or the other. If they were all one of these and then didn't want to even accept the possibility that there's a little bit of a lot of these that they could work on, they're probably not coachable and they're not going to be in the talk anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:45):
It's like I imagine each of these is very particular and it's this journey you go on to work on yourself. Let me just ask, what's the most common issue that you've found across these labels of type CEOs? What's the most common one and what do you often recommend someone to work on specifically to help them through that?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:22:02):
I think ready, fire, aim is the most common that we've seen, and that has been an affliction that's been growing in the last number of years. It wasn't long ago that CEOs could paper over poor execution with easy access to capital. Suddenly, over the last number of years, we're expecting founders to be better operators. Better operators means eventually being on a path when more cash comes into the business and out of the business. That doesn't happen by accident. The ready, fire, aim CEO has probably suffered this pain where they took lots and lots of bets. Maybe they measured the outcome after the fact and they were wrong and they were wrong and they were wrong in ways that were expensive, and they've raised their hand to say, "I see it. I want to get better at this." Basic, basic business design and business planning is not some corporate effort. It's some thoughtful exercise that starts with what are we working backwards from?

(00:23:02):
Because in any given time, Lenny, companies are working backwards from one of four things, whether they like it or not. I am working backwards from an exit. I'm working backwards from a next fundraise. I'm working backwards from profitability or I'm working backwards from winding down. We don't talk about the fourth one that much, but I got to choose one. I got to choose the top of the mountain. More often than not, they're choosing a fundraise. Then we'll ask that founder, you know your market, you know your investors, you know the next set of investors, we've done some intel. What has to be true to unlock the next fundraise? That's a qualitative and quantitative answer, but we write it down. We need to get better at go to market. We need to land our first partner. We need to launch next iteration of the product and show this level of efficacy, engagement, what have you. Can we codify that? Yes. Can we talk through what actions would be required on what cadence to unlock that quantified set of results? Yes.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:24:00):
... that quantified set of results? Yes. Do we understand what resources would be required to do those things? Recognize we might have to squint through some of it, but again, the answer is yes. [inaudible 00:24:13] now aimed. If we have a culture that has some accountability, that has a communication architecture, so there's some rituals about how we meet and how we share information and how we talk through problems, and how we work through bottlenecks, well, now we have a plan and now we have accountability. I now no longer have to just guess all the time. And this only works for the CEO who says, "My improvisational efforts got me here, but I don't think they'll get me there."

(00:24:47):
There's a guy I worked for a long time ago, and he had this phrase... He had like seven or eight phrases, he would use them over and over and over again. It was hard not to commit them all to memory, and one of them was, "If you keep doing what you're doing, you keep getting what you're getting." And for the ready, fire, aim folks who realize the weakness of that at scale, the way to counteract that, is to start with good planning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:12):
It's interesting that's the most common type of CO, when with Founder Mode, it feels like it just accelerates that further. The whole meme of Founder Mode, which are what makes you upset. Makes sense. Great.

(00:25:26):
Okay, so I love that you talked about exiting as basically one of these four working backwards paths, because that's where I wanted to go next. I want to talk about some of these specific frameworks and skills and methodologies that you teach, and one of them... I want to almost go to the end of selling your company. And the reason I'm excited to talk about this, is if you think about, and tell me if I'm wrong, but it feels like most startups that succeed end up selling their company. That's the most likely success, right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:25:58):
Yes, by far.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
Great. Yeah, because the other option is IPO or just run this privately forever. Or fail, basically, and fold. So of the successful options, the most common is selling. At the same time, founders have never done this before, they don't know what they're doing. The other side, often, has done it many times, and so it's a pretty treacherous and scary and high-stakes thing to do and to learn on the spot. And you've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box Paradigm that I love, that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long term. Can you talk about what this is?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:26:36):
I can, and I want to give credit where it's due. There's a book by this name, it's called Magic Box Paradigm, written by an independent banker named Ezra Roizen. And the book's fantastic, and Ezra is fantastic.

(00:26:46):
What we've done, is we've operationalized it so that we could teach founders over, and over, and over again. If the founder wants to hire a banker for this particular process, because we're not bankers, we're not BD, we don't get paid that way, we're teachers. But if wanted to hire a banker, go hire Ezra. But the methodology itself is a inversion for how venture and venture boards have thought about startups being ready for sale for a long, long time. It's utterly counter to so much advice that founders have heard. There are two ways you can get acquired. This is purposely reductive. One is you put up a for-sale sign. This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you. You figure out the categories of buyers, the companies there, the contact list within that. You ping them and say, "We're open to a transaction," or some euphemism the like. You contact them and say, "I'll give you some information now. Sign an NDA. Give me an indication of interest by this date." And you work through a process, and you pray you have more than one person at the end of the game, try and ratchet them up, sign a term sheet. They will then re-trade along the way, right up until the point you die and you hope you get a deal done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):
Sounds very familiar.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:28:08):
And it's one that often will just hit the nervous system of any founder that's been through it a couple of times. Because man, is it a fraught exercise? What Magic Box argues, is that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. You have brought someone in. And there are three stages to Magic Box work. There is learn the fantasy, there's prove the fantasy, and there's quantify the fantasy.

(00:28:43):
All right, so what the hell do I mean by a fantasy? You're an early-stage startup, and you meet a company that is in your space, in your vertical, what have you, and they're much more advanced than you. It's a large business. Generally speaking, another oversimplification here, large companies are interested in small companies because they're technology. And small companies are interested in large companies because they're distribution. And there's someone at the large company who becomes fascinated with you.

(00:29:12):
What's the fascination? What they see in their head is, "Oh, interesting. If I buy your company, this thing happens." The classic example of this is Instagram. This is the number one example of this. Lenny, do you remember how much revenue they had when they got acquired by now Meta?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):
I think it was zero.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:34):
I think it was zero.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:35):
Okay.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:36):
Do you remember the acquisition price?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:37):
A billion dollars, which was absurd at that point.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:41):
There was no math Facebook could use, historically speaking, that would justify a billion dollars. It had to be a model on the future. This is Magic Box to a T. They had a fantasy that adding Instagram would expand ad revenue. They figured out some way to prove it. I'll explain more on what I mean by proof. And then their quantification was based on the future. And that's the difference between a Magic Box approach and traditional approaches. Traditional approaches are based on the past, Magic Box is on the future.

(00:30:14):
Let me tell a story. In one of our companies in construction tech, their technology was able to suck in video camera data from construction sites for project planning. No one was doing this yet. And the business was doing pretty well. We helped the founders launch the company. We got first product in market. We raised a couple of rounds of capital. The product mostly worked. But we weren't sure it was venture scale as we were going along. And we had some large construction tech companies and real estate companies and development companies leaning into us. And one particular company then said, "Huh, we're really good at construction planning, and we've collected all of this video data that we don't use at all." And the champion on the other side in the product org, he has a fantasy. "Oh, shit. We take your video analytics platform and plug it into what we do, and this is what happens to my business."

(00:31:18):
Now, the person on the other side is a person. And the reason I'm being specific about that, is because you don't sell to a company. Magic Box is about finding the person. You're finding the champion on the other side, the person who has motivated for their own reasons, career, money, reputation, what have you. They see the fantasy. They fall in love. And this person says, "I am in love with this idea. If I can grab security data into my product organization. Now I have to prove the fantasy."

(00:31:53):
What's different about a champion in this kind of process, is they want to find a way to say yes. They're not looking for a way to say no. And this brings us to the four characters you're going to meet along the path of Magic Box. There might be a fifth. You're going to meet your champion, you're going to meet your advocates, you're going to meet your blockers, and you're going to meet your buyer. You might meet Corp Dev along the way.

(00:32:20):
Let me talk about each of those folks. The champion is the one who's fallen in love. They're the ones with the fantasy. They're the ones who are arguing on your behalf. They're the ones fighting for you when you're not in the room. They are texting you, they're telling you things about the business that they're probably not supposed to tell you.

(00:32:33):
The buyer. All they care about is math. It might be a committee, it might be a group, the IC, the EC, the investment group, what have you. They're the ones who actually can sign off on a deal. They care about business case.

(00:32:45):
Advocates... Lenny, do you play chess?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:49):
I have played chess, yes.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:32:50):
You have played chess. So advocates are pawns. They don't matter at all until they matter enormously. These are folks that, like, you are the CEO doing a meeting with your potential buyer, and there are somehow 12 people on the Zoom call, but only two do the talking. The other 10 might be advocates. They're rooting for you, but they will take no political risk. Their value is in giving you intel.

(00:33:16):
Blocker. This is the person who can't say yes, but they can say no. This is OPSEC, this is Procurement, this is Legal. You're going to meet all these characters during the Magic Box dance. Your champion just wants you to get the deal done so in love. So what happens, is they've come up with a fantasy and you as a CEO need to lean into it. This isn't enterprise selling. I'm not trying to sell you this thing that I have. I'm just trying to find ways to say yes.

(00:33:47):
So when, in my story, the person says, "Could we provide you all of our video data that we've collected forever and you now could enhance our ability to predict whether large- scale construction projects are on time"? I don't want the CEO saying anything other than, "We can do that."

(00:34:07):
Now, phase two, I need to prove it. Okay, because I have a champion who wants to say yes, proof can be really easy. And the reason the proof is so important, is not to convince the champion they're in love with the fantasy. They're already convinced. It's because in almost all cases, big company is buying little company and your champion doesn't have unilateral authority. They're going to socialize the deal. They have to get buy-in from who? The aforementioned buyer. They have to be able to survive the aforementioned blockers.

(00:34:43):
So eventually, when they pitch this to whatever committee is in charge, that committee is going to say, "What proof do we have that it works?" And we just want to be able to provide the champion with enough evidence that it works. So in this case, we said to the champion, " Well, give us video data, and we will provide you the evidence that you need." Because we're dealing with a champion who's not a cynic, because champions aren't, we could tell them, "And provide us the data in this way, in this fashion, and here's what we'll send you after. Are we in agreement?" We know we're already going to win the proof, and it's critically important in these dances.

(00:35:27):
Number three, quantify. At this point, we're not up for sale, but we're spending a lot of calories on somebody, and they know it. So we have our CEOs say the following phrase to them: "My board is asking questions. They're wondering why we're spending so many calories on this when it's not really core and we're not selling you our product. I'm convinced of how exciting this could be, together, but I think we need to do some math. So I can explain to my board why this might matter. So let's imagine all this works, because it's going to work, and it's a year from now or five years from now. What changes about your business?" And the champion will tell you, "Retention does this, or deal size goes like this, or market share goes like this." And you'll say to them, "Fantastic. Look, I'm going to build some shitty verse version of the model. You tell me what I got right and what I got wrong, but I have a board meeting in 16 days, and I need to be able to walk them through the justify why I am spending so many calories on this exercise."

(00:36:34):
You build the model, you hand it to them. If they in any way respond to your model, you've won. Because you have now divorced history from future, and you are now playing in future, you are playing the Instagram game in this case. The ending of the story for the company that I was describing, it was a business sub 2 million in revenue. Our prospects of raising series B felt low. We were not yet profitable, and that was an exit that was generational wealth for the co-founders and their families. The CEO went on and spent two-plus years with the now public company that did this acquisition. The technology did get integrated, but it took a long time and they had to do a lot of changes to it, certainly beyond what was envisioned during the diligence process. But all parties are happy. And if we hadn't done it this way and we had just been up for sale, we'd get a dollar for that company.

(00:37:40):
A couple of other side points that are really important here. For any of you founders out there that are thinking about working backwards from an exit, there are two things that I really want to stress. One is the fantasy is beyond just, "What is the business change you can have?" The fantasy is, "Your books are in order." Your fantasy is all of your investors will sign off on the deal and you will have unanimous consent, that the key members of your team are going to stick around, that you're a joy to work with. Please God, founder, do not puncture the fantasy at any time.

(00:38:21):
So whatever is starting to shape in your buyer's mind, get to know it. Live that everybody wins from that game. Second, Corp Dev, they will probably show up in the stands. Corp Dev make deals. They're not deal sponsors, they're not a champion, they're not a buyer. They are an expert negotiator. Their job is to facilitate deals and get deals done. The most important things to understand is that they can be a leverage point to have a deal move with some process and some pace and some urgency. Because either deals have momentum or they die, and Corp Dev can help there.

(00:39:04):
Second, they are way better at negotiating than you. So anytime dealing with a superior negotiator, the only thing you can do to try and even the scales, is move the negotiation async. So founders, repeat after me, I'm talking to you directly now. You'll say to Corp Dev, "You know I'm not alone in this decision. I love what you just said and I'm excited about this opportunity. Once I see it in writing, I can socialize it with advisors, lawyers, co-founders, whoever." But don't negotiate live. You will lose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):
Let me just say that was extremely delightful to listen to. I've never heard like a M&A strategy be this fun. And it makes me want to sell a company. It's like, "Okay, let's do this. I'm hyped." I think you got it all. I have a few questions.

(00:39:56):
Interestingly, the middle part is... It feels a lot like enterprise sales, which a lot of founders are used to. Understand the stakeholders move things forward. Here's your champion, here's your blockers, here's the buyer. Is there anything there you want to say, what's maybe most different from enterprise sales, which I think a lot of founders are maybe used to? Or is it pretty similar?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:40:14):
Yeah, I think three things. One is there are a lot of moments in enterprise sales where we're trying to push for a compelling event. That doesn't work in seduction. The playful metaphor that we'll often use, is you've been dating for a while, this person could be the person, but they're not quite convinced yet that it should be a life together, and you're sitting at dinner. And in enterprise sales, you're eager to get it done. You're eager to move the relationship forward and move in and get engaged, what have you. And so you might be inclined to say, "Hey, either we move this relationship the next step, or there are a whole bunch of people eyeing me, and I'm going to go date someone else."

(00:41:06):
That conversation never goes well, and in Magic Box founders are eager to do the same thing, thinking that competition will improve their deal size, when in fact I think more often than not, that is a negative signal until the very end of the dance. So instead in enterprise selling where I'm pushing, in Magic Box, I'm always trying to entice, I'm never, ever trying to push. So instead I might say things like, "Hey, I'm going to raise my next round in Q1, because I've been intending to do this business independently. Now all I really want to do, is win. I just want my product in as many customers' hands as possible. Whether I do that on my own as I was planning, in partnership with someone, or under someone else's roof, honestly I don't care. But I have a company to run and I'm going to go raise my next round in Q1. And if I do that, probably too expensive for this deal to make sense anymore, and my board will want me to move on anyway."

(00:43:08):
Okay, so I'm thinking about as a founder hearing this, and I feel like what they're probably wondering is that first step of finding that person, starting to build this fantasy. Any advice you could share for a founder that's like, "We probably need to sell this company"? What can they do to start creating these relationships, find this person, create this fantasy in their minds?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:43:28):
Ezra does this really well in the book. Again, it has to be not solicitous. So one of our companies, we had maybe 20 months of capital left, and the two co-founders and our team were convinced, "This isn't a venture business. We thought it might be a venture business. It's not a venture business. It takes too long to do a deal that's not that interesting with each of our enterprise customers." It was disappointing, but at least we were honest about it. "Okay, so who are we going to sell to? Let's go play this game."

(00:44:04):
So we started with categories, categories of buyers. It could be, for this particular example that was in my head, ERP companies could be a buyer, large banks could be a buyer, the big software companies like Microsoft could be a buyer. There were a few different categories. And we said, "Great. Who are the companies within those categories that make sense?" They're acquisitive, they have the balance sheet for it. There's a Corp Dev department, so we know that they actually know what they're talking about here. Ideally, there's an existing relationship with core team or advisors or board members. Make a list.

(00:44:45):
Now, how do we meet them in a way without selling them? So one of the examples in the book, which I love, is small startup wants to meet the luminaries in a space, and they have their PR agency set up a panel where they contact the CEOs of the potential buyers and say, "We're putting together a panel of the world's foremost experts in X. We're going to put four people on the panel, and it's going to be you and famous person number two and famous person number three, and this fourth person," that is a luminary to us. And it's our startup CEO. And suddenly you're at the table as a peer. It's a completely different conversation.

(00:45:32):
The second one, and this is going to sound a little silly, but I am not exaggerating, it works. If you are a CEO founder and you have that title on LinkedIn, it's amazing the responses you'll get. So we made this list and we just started to send connection requests to the CEOs or CPOs or CFOs on our target list, and said something as simple as this, "You're doing something really cool. So are we. You game just for a 30-minute chat? Because I don't know where it'll go, but I think it'll be fun." Keep it that informal. It's peer to peer. I'm not selling you anything.

(00:46:10):
If you can draw a line to some post that they had or some speech that they gave, even better. But we found without fail, there would be math that would show up, one out of four, one out of five, or one out of six, "Yeah, that sounds fun." There's a lot of those CEOs never talk to startups, and that's fascinating to them, especially when presented with the energy of, "I just want to have a fun, intellectual discussion."

(00:46:37):
What you're looking for in that first conversation, and this is what we ask our CEOs to do, is to ask questions like, "What do you care most about in the next year? What's the mandate? What about for your department? What are the things that keep you up at night? What's the break? What's the thing that could actually kill everything, if you had a pre-mortem for the next year?" Those kind of open-ended questions, because what we want our CEO listening for, is the fantasy to see if there's some intersection between what they care about and what we might be able to squint and say we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:07):
It's interesting, because it sounds a lot like there's a jobs-to-be-done framework here, or just like, "What is the job they need done?" What is the pain you're going to solve, and then create a fantasy around how amazing it'll be for them if you can solve that problem.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:47:19):
And ideally they'll say it and you just reflect it back in active listening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):
Chris Voss negotiation style. Okay, so you're the kind of guest, Jonathan, where the whole podcast could be about each one of these topics, and so I know there's so much more to talk about here. I want to move to a different topic, but to leave folks with, one is if they want to explore this methodology more, there's a book you mentioned, called Magic Box Paradigm by Ezra Roizen, right?

(00:47:51):
If companies are in this process, starting to think about it, does it make sense for them to come to you and like, "Hey, help me through this process"? I know you said, "Go to an investment banker." Or does it make sense to like, "Hey, let's bring on Jonathan," or someone from your team to help them?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
It makes sense to like, Hey, let's bring on Jonathan or someone from your team to help them.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:48:03):
We meet two types of founders. Founder one says, fix this part of my business, totally transactional. I want to raise the next round, or I'm hiring people badly or my founders aren't getting along, or I want to sell my company. Well, I need to be honest, that's not interesting to us. That's not our work. Go find someone who is, and I don't mean this disparagingly, but like a screwdriver, like fixes one thing, go fix one thing. Then we meet second type of founder and that founder says, most likely to themselves, 'cause it's the only safe audience. There's some gap between the CEO I am and the one my company needs me to be. There are a set of skills that I'm great at and there are these things where I know if I'm really honest with myself, if I listen to the quiet voice, I'm soft at these things or I'm not good enough at these things or I have some imposter syndrome about these things and if I don't get better at them, danger. That's the one we work with. And it's when they care that much about both the hard skill development and maybe the soft skill development in their path to become a great CEO.

(00:49:10):
How to sell the company. It's one of the skills. We teach this to all of our founders as well as hiring and management and planning. I don't care what the thing is. For every one of our founders, we audit them and say, here's what you're great at, here's what you're shitty at, and here's what you've never done before, and which of these do you want to work on next given where the company is in its cycle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):
Great segue to where I wanted to go with this, which is hiring. So I hear all the time that a founder's core job is fundraising and hiring an amazing team. Basically that's their main goal. Just like hire amazing people. The people you hire make your company, create the culture. You got to get that right. But similar to trying to sell your company, most founders have never really hired lots of people, they've never hired for all these different skill sets they're trying to hire for and I know that you guys spend a lot of time helping founders hire and find amazing people. Can you just share some of the advice you share with founders for how to find and hire amazing people?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:50:06):
Yeah, so we actually think the CEO has three jobs. We agree with the two that you said, but we think there's a third. One is, make sure everyone knows where we're going. The second one, pick the right people for the team. Third one, give those people the tools they need to win. And you can abstract from those what they all mean, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:27):
I love that.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:50:28):
... most founders are really bad at hiring. They fall prey to all sorts of pretty common human biases. The lazy ones, back to laissez-faire, think it's just gambling like, oh cool, they worked at Meta and Salesforce already, so hire them, just gambling. There was work done by and then codified in a beautiful book. I'm going to make sure I get the names right, Geoffrey Smart and Randy Street. They had a consulting firm that dates back to the mid-nineties. Then they wrote a book in 2007 or 2008 called Who: The A Method for Hiring. We have operationalized that book and then expanded on it 'cause there are some parts of it that we found a little dated, but it's really still as applicable today as it ever was.

(00:51:18):
And I think there are three core mistakes that founders make all the time, that can be really easily rectified. The first one is, you should hire people who have already done the thing you need to have done next. And I know that sounds simple, but founders don't think of hiring that way. They start with a job description. We've been taught that for a long time. Start with the job description. It's a fucking mistake. Start with, it's 12 months later, you hired the person, they started today, 12 months have gone by, you're clinking champagne because of how great it's been. What's changed about the business? What does success look like 12 months later? Document it. And then when you interview people, look for people that have already done that stuff.

(00:52:13):
Second, the notion of does the person in front of you have a history of creating raving fans? They talk in the book about this idea of you being pulled or pushed in your career. If you were an outstanding performer in Job A, it is a high likelihood that in job B, someone associated with you in job A is going to pull you into the next thing and then pull you into the next thing and pull you into the next thing and you'll never do a job search 'cause you were great. And if you see a history of that, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, really attractive candidate. Third, core values matter a lot. Culture is not an accident. Culture at scale is the codification of what matters to a business and the ritualization of living those values. It starts with whoever the founders are and then it will emanate across as long as the founders are super consistent. But that also means you need a methodology for evaluating the next human in front of you on whether they actually represent your values. We think of these interview stages in a way similar to the book, we use slightly different language, but we think that there is a culture interview, there is a functional interview, and there is a technical interview, but they're designed to get at these notions of have they actually done this kind of work before? Have they been pulled or pushed in their career and are they your kind of human?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):
Funny on that last detail actually, [inaudible 00:54:03] at Airbnb, there was actually a core values interview team that was formed around studying what the founders Brian, and Joe, and Nate valued specifically and then they codified them to core values at the business and then there's this team that was a very select handpicked team that at every interview loop interviewed the person for their values.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:54:22):
That is a beautiful example of how interviewing for values is independent of title. 'Cause you'll find people in the company at every stage of a company that are the best ambassadors, the best embodiments of those values. Please use them for interviewing and in addition, they love it 'cause they're protecting their castle. They love where they work, they want to keep it that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:45):
So true that team is a real special team and it was really honored to be on that team. So let me summarize what you just shared, which I love. There's so much value here, it just keeps going and going. So when you're hiring, your advice is: look for people, one, that have done it before; two, that have been pulled from job to job by someone else that loves their work and wants them to be with them at this new company. And then three, their values match the values of the founder and the business essentially, right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:55:11):
Yes. And for the recruiters out there, a really simple way to get rid of a lot of the crap that ends up showing up at the top of the funnel is just to ask the simple question even in the cover letter, of your last ex-bosses, how many would get on the phone and say, you're amazing? If there's any equivocation in the answer, great, move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:35):
So a couple of follow-up questions here. One is, this point of hiring people that have done it, obviously this implies don't hire junior up-and-comers as much. Thoughts on just when it makes sense to hire someone more junior that's really ambitious, real smart, you think they can learn the job, thoughts there?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:55:53):
So one of our companies is hiring a team of reasonably junior account execs. We're looking for folks that have been out of school for two years. Now, that means they are highly unlikely to have had three years of quota achievements and a similar... you get the point. Okay, so how do you hire someone who's already done it? We know what success looks like 12 months later. For that role, they've learned how to hunt, they've been able to create pipeline of X and close Y in business, et cetera. What we are looking for then in their history, if they have any sales chops of any kind. They could be selling Girl Scout cookies, or tickets to some event, or they work for a non-profit for while. I don't care, but I want some evidence that they've sold. I want some evidence that they're comfortable getting on the phone or showing up at meetings or showing up at events. So, that they've done it before should be reviewed or thought of creatively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):
Got it.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:57:07):
Now for more senior roles, I want an explicit. We think of, for example, for executives, Lenny, we think there are three types of executives that startups end up hiring over time. We call them the architect, the optimizer, and the scaler. The architect, let's use sales as an example. This is someone who has to build a playbook. So they're going to uncomfortably stay close to the founder, watch and listen, and listen to recordings and pick their brain to pull the magic from the founder of like, oh, here's the dance that she or he goes through to actually close a deal and they write first playbook. And the goal of the codification of that is so you can bring on a first account exec and the next account exec because account execs back to our language earlier in this adult children dynamic are children. You need to give them structure for them to win. That's the architect. The optimizer, this is someone who's now going from a few account execs to maybe 10, 15 and we now have targets we have to hit. The business is now reaching a different level of professionalism and expectation and you have to optimize that earlier playbook to try and find more efficiency and performance out of it.

(00:58:21):
The scaler is saying, okay, now how do I find leverage? How do I have 10X more account execs or how to get other people to sell for me? They're all going to be called VP of sales or chief revenue officer. They're completely different archetypes, and that same person exists in engineering and in product, et cetera. In those cases, I only would want to bring on an architect if they'd been an architect before. If they'd only been an optimizer, they're going to fail because they've never written playbook from scratch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
It touches on a conversation I had recently. It was a live podcast recording with Shreyas Doshi at my summit where he talks about a lot of people are really frustrated at work because they're in the wrong one of those buckets, essentially. Like you enjoy certain type of work and your job is not doing that type of work, whether it's in your case scaling or optimizing. And so, it just reminds that if you're frustrated at work, you're in the wrong job in terms of the type of output they're trying to expect from you.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:59:18):
The story in my head is that talking to me and my colleagues sometimes can feel a little like death by frameworks. We have one for everything and in this example, I think if you're going to be sustainably successful in any kind of job, I don't care what it is, three things have to be true. You have to be good at it, you have to like it, and the market has to give a shit about it. And if one of those is off, you're not staying in that job long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):
Yeah. And this touches on the name of your firm, Enjoy The Work, got to enjoy the work to make it sustainable. Okay, one other thing. So one other follow up question real quick on the hiring and then I want to talk about one other bucket of work. And again, I think each of these could be like an hour, two hour long podcast conversation. I love that there's this recurring theme of working backwards to inform what you do today. So earlier you talked about working backwards from what the outcome you want next for your business, whether it's fundraising or exit or winding down. And for hiring, you have the similar advice, work backwards from what you want this person to achieve in the first year, whether it's drive this sort of growth in the product or drive sales. I guess anything else there of just the power of working backwards versus the typical approach for hiring, you talked about job descriptions.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:00:26):
Hiring is never the goal and it's often the first thing that we'll hear from a founder, "I have to hire this person." One, that is so dangerous for confirmation bias. The hiring manager is always the one most burdened by that particular bias, but it's also hiring is never the goal. We will pull them back to over and over and over again, which of the three milestones matter, right? Fundraise, exit, profitability. What has to change about the business, for example, to get to that fundraise? How do we quantify that change? Some sort of goal setting framework. OKRs, EOs, I don't care. All goal setting frameworks have the same bones. There's some description of it, there's some quantification of it, there's some work that has to be done. There's some accountability rituals with clear owners and clear agreements.

(01:01:18):
So once I actually have the quantification of here's what work needs to be done, I now know what resources I need to be able to pull that work forward and therefore now I know what kind of humans I need, whether I'm hiring or renting. And that should drive the conversation, not the, "Oh God, I need another PM." It's no, here's the set of features that we've said matter most this year. Here's the gap in the resources we have and the resources we need, that's why we're hiring this role. And here's what success would look like 12 months from now or six months from now. So they're tying back to what would change about the business.

(01:01:57):
And this is this recurring theme of our work with our founders. They're so in it Lenny that they rarely have time to sit above what they're working on. This notion of working in the business versus on the business. And so much of our work is to separate them from the day-to-day, which is enormously important, not in any way denigrating it, and I need to know where I'm headed and why, and how I'm going to measure progress along the way. And so, so much of what we're doing with them is to say, I want to hear from you what you think success looks like. I'm going to push back and pressure test a bunch of things. Can we define that in a way? Can we agree on who needs to do the work along the way, and how we're going to keep checking on it to keep feedback loop short? Now we can go back into business and then we'll check again in a week or in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):
I love that. That's actually a great segue to the final bucket I want to spend some time on which is growth and go to market. Another area that many founders have never worked on before. A lot of founders are like, Hey, I have this awesome idea. I'm going to build this awesome product. I know how to do that. I know what market needs. But building a go-to-market motion to get it into people's hands is a whole different skill. We spent a lot of time on this on the podcast, you have a really cool simple framework of just how to think about go-to-market. There's all this like, oh, you need a go-to-market strategy. Talk about how you talk to founders about thinking about what it takes to put together a go-to-market plan and how to make it a repeatable motion versus just I'm just going to go to people and try to sell them.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:03:37):
Our founders, even the most capable of them find this topic pretty overwhelming because it branches into so many areas. So we do try and distill it to something that is in bite-sized chunks. We think of it in four pieces. The first piece is ideal customer profile. Who do we really want to sell to? What are their qualifications? What are the discovery questions we would use to get to those qualifications? What are the kill criteria to know that this is [inaudible 01:04:10] fool's goal, this really isn't the human?

(01:04:13):
Second bucket, loosely called marketing. But within that marketing is also positioning. So what is our uncommon denominator from the enemies? So who are we competing against? Is it actual companies or is it status quo in some sort? What are they great at? What are we great at? What are we great at that they're not? Then how do we represent that in the world? That's branding and artifacts and identity work, et cetera.

(01:04:44):
Next is demand gen, which we'll simplify to say, how do we go find the humans we want? I've long loved the book Traction that Gabriel Weinberg... I'm going to forget unfortunately the co-author's name right now, Jason Mares? Sorry. Where they talk about the 19 channels that all companies have availability to, they're the same ones. Now the book has got a couple of years on it, so there are a couple of new channels that have popped out since, but what we then try and expand the aperture for our founders is rather than just think about meeting your next customer through however you did at your last company, availability bias, instead, which of these might make most sense next? A simple two by two matrix can work here like some experimentation, some brain writing. Love brain writing, not brainstorming. I know you've talked about that on prior pods. And then high impact, low effort. Can we think of the three or four experiments we want to run by channel? Let's go play.

(01:05:48):
And then fourth, sales. And this is the codification of a playbook. How are we having the conversation? How are we doing discovery? How are we handling objections? How are we doing demo? How are we moving to close? If we can get through those four, then we can start to talk about deployment and customer success and upselling and account management, et cetera, et cetera. Those are good problems to have. Oh my god, my install base is so large, I need to manage it. Great, great fricking problem. But we try and break this complexity of going from individually selling to building a machine into just these four buckets. Who am I selling to? What do we want to say about ourselves? How do we reach them? How do we close them?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):
Amazing. I was going to summarize that. You did an excellent job there. Before we follow up on this, you mentioned this term brain writing. What does that mean?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:06:35):
Oh, first time I heard of this was Adam Grant. I don't know if he's the originator of the idea. Brainstorming, you talked about this a bit in your Annie Duke podcast as well of how horribly coercive meetings can be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:55):
For brainstorming, especially.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:06:56):
For brainstorming especially. And so, what many of our founders don't recognize because they just see like, Hey, I'm just sitting around a table with a group of folks I respect, so we can just debate things as peers. No, you can't. You're a founder. Your voice has a megaphone attached to it even if you can't hear it. So you have to turn down the megaphone if you actually want to learn what your people have to say. So brain writing is I'm going to expose an idea and I want everyone to now write and weigh in on there... it could be in a survey, it could be in a shared doc, what have you, my preferences in through some sort of methodology, you are now sharing your opinions, comments, edits, dreams, in an async way that no one else can see until it's all combined, maybe even ideally without authorship identified.

(01:07:50):
Then when the founders weigh in, you don't know, they're just a part of the mass. Let everyone read the thing. I even like the Amazon, take the first 10 minutes of a meeting, let's just go read so we're all fully present and then have a debate. What it allows for is the dampening of the founder effect in meetings.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
You're just so full of golden nuggets. That's just like a random tangent that I think could be really transformative for a lot of teams. So the advice here is just when you're trying to ideate and brainstorm, don't go in a big room and put post- its on a wall and talk throughout ideas and have a discussion. Instead, just everyone individually sits and thinks and shares their thoughts and the founder presents, here's a problem, here's a question we're trying to tackle.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:08:39):
What it also allows for is an evening of the playing field between fast processors and slow processors, introverts and extroverts, because they're all equally potentially talented in your room, but if you do live brainstorming, you have diminished all the folks that prefer to sit and chew on something first.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:02):
That's very much me. That's exactly how I operate. I need to think and process. I'm not on the spot quick thinker person. So 100% fan of this approach. Let me come back to your go-to-market framework. I have the notes pulled up here. So basically if you're a founder or even a product builder and you're trying to think about how do I... people keep telling me I need a go to market plan, I need to grow this thing. How do I think about this? You're basically saying there's these four buckets to think about; who are you selling to? How are you going to motivate them and get them excited to buy your thing? How do you reach them? And then how do you close them?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:09:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):
Luckily I have podcasts and newsletter posts on every single one of these buckets, if folks want to pursue each one of these. I have templates for ICPs, marketing advice, all these things. So that's good news. There's a lot of content for people to read if they want to explore this stuff. Let me ask you, where do you often find the biggest bang for your buck when you come to a founder or if founder comes to you and they're like, I need to figure out, go-to-market motions? Just start from the top and work your way down. Or is there, here's where maybe you want to spend a lot of time.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:10:10):
Early stage founders, and this is certainly more true for the first timers Lenny than the veterans 'cause they learn this problem. The first timers are like twenty-something year olds in a bar and they're being social for the first time in their lives, and anyone that makes eye contact with them is enough for them to say, I want to go on a date with you. That's it. There's no discrimination of any kind, like, oh my god, they like me, I'm in. That's the mistake that hounds first timers. The veterans and those we get our hands on. Instead, we say, let's imagine you could build your perfect customer in a lab, like a Petri dish and you grew them, what do they look like? And if you have any kind of install base, I'll ask the question. I just did this with the founder the other day. They are enterprise whale hunting business. They have four large customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:13):
Wait, actually whale... okay, whale hunting in terms of large wealth person or actual whales?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:11:21):
The extreme of enterprise selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
Okay, okay, got it. I want to see a whale hunting startup. Okay, go on.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:11:29):
I said, so which of your four customers is your favorite? Which one, if I got them on the phone, they would rave about you. They would be salivating openly with a chance to evangelize what you're doing for them. And they was like, oh, that's clear. It's this one of the four. Great. Tell me about them. And what you start to see and pull apart from that is the founder does have an ideal profile. They do have a dream. Now, there are all sorts of risks about is the world too small? Is it not a big enough market if they get too tight, and founders get so caught up in that and it's a mistake because all we're-

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:12:00):
... so caught up in that, and it's a mistake. Because all we're looking for in the beginning is a white-hot center of opportunity, a small population that is an enormous fan that's getting enormous impact. We can worry about adjacencies and expansion later. I like to remind them that Amazon just sold books. We can start with one thing and be great at it. So where the founders often get hung up on for us is that they've moved towards selling without contemplating ideal customer profile, without contemplating qualifications, without contemplating discovery questions that get to that. And most importantly, kill criteria, if this is true do not sign them, even if they want to go out on a date with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
I'm glad you said that because that's exactly what I believe and I hear often on this podcast is how underappreciated picking your customers in early leads are. And if you think about this funnel you described, figure out who you're selling to, how do you motivate them, find them and then sell them, all this trickles down from who are you going after. You will know how to motivate them if you know who you're talking to versus the opposite. If you're talking to everyone-

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:13:11):
It's the most expensive mistake of those four.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:15):
Okay. Is there anything else on go-to-market or growth you think might be helpful just to touch on before we close up our conversation?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:13:25):
The one thing I'll share, this goes back to the ready, fire, aim that we talked about earlier, is that there's implicitly a funnel, mathematical funnel, to what we just described. And founders often make the mistake when planning for the year ahead of I need to be at this revenue to justify this multiple. And then all of the funnel math is a plug, and that's death, as opposed to here's what's been true for the last three months, six months, nine months, 12 months. And then what assumptions can I reasonably make with ways I'm going to influence that funnel going forward, to go build up to where I think I'll be a year from now? And it just lowers the bias that your planning process operates with.

(01:14:15):
But when a founder starts from a place of, "I have to get to 3 million or we're dead," you're already dead. As opposed to what do I really believe I can do to get there, changing top of the funnel, changing conversion rates along the way, changing a deal size or deal length, et cetera based on my recent history, and then have a conversation about the gap between where I think the business reasonably can get with some ambition, and where I think I need to be financially, because that's the more mature conversation and that's the one the ready, fire, aim CEO doesn't have. That's the one most founders have only started to learn to have over the last few years when capital dried up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
I love that. I love just how practical and real talk your advice always ends up being. Speaking of that, I emailed a founder that you work with and asked him, "What should I ask? What should I ask Jonathan when he comes on the podcast?"

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:14:57):
Uh-oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):
And he said something that was really... That's great. It was really unexpected what he said. He said that the biggest lesson he learned from you is to, as a founder, to trust his intuition more throughout the journey of his startup. Can you just talk about that as something you've learned, something you've seen, that maybe founders under appreciate?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:15:31):
It's impossible not to be a startup CEO and not face many existential moments. Is my company going to survive? Did I make a mistake? Will I ever be hired again? Should I sell the company now? Should I break up with a co-founder? Should I fire this critical employee? They happen to all of us. And fear is not a good decision maker. Our lizard brain is a really bad decision maker in those moments.

(01:16:07):
And so what we'll often share with the founder who's facing one of these scenarios, and I know the CEO you're describing and he's facing one of these scenarios, we'll say to them, "Do you know that little voice when you get really still, the quiet one that says you should marry this person, you should take this job, you should start this company? Watch out for that human, they're a bad one." And most of the time, Lenny, when I frame it that way the person across me says, "Yeah, I know that voice." And I'll ask, "How do you hear it?" And they're usually some version of, "I have to get really alone, really still, really quiet, walk on the beach, listen to music, work out, play with my pet."

(01:17:06):
I said that voice is who you are. It's not your brain. Your brain is a tool. It's our hands, it's our feet, just a tool. It's a pattern recognition machine. But who you are, if you can watch your brain, you know what you're thinking, like, oh, look what my brain's doing. That means you're not your brain. It's something else. And that's the little voice, and that little voice is going to be right. And where we get screwed up in life is when we stop listening to that voice, when the mania of our chaos of our lives get in the way of that voice.

(01:17:42):
And so whenever our founders face one of those moments, it's not a framework, it's not a playbook, or even a directed piece of advice from us to say, "You should just go left. I've seen this before. Go left." Nope. I trust founder intuition. If the founder says this business is still going to work, or this co-founder is the wrong person, or yes, it's time to sell, I'm in. We're just here to support them. And we try and be the only person in their life that is fully on their team because we're not on the preferred side of the CAFS table. We're not fiduciary, we're not board members, not a co-founder, none of those things. And so in those moments we'll just say, "Can you get really quiet?"

(01:18:21):
And the founder you're talking about, I have the story in my head, he was facing a breakup moment with his co-founder, and I asked him, because he's good at getting quiet, "What did the voice say to you way back when?" And the voice said to him, "This is the wrong fit. This isn't going to work. He believes in different things than I do, and that's going to go badly." But the lizard brain didn't want to believe that, and so it took another year.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:58):
Wow. I had tingles throughout that entire piece of advice. I love how it's also very applicable to just life, not even just being a founder. It's a good reminder to trust that voice more. It's interesting that this also connects to founder-mode a little bit, and I'm curious how you think about that where a lot of the founder-mode advice is like trust your judgment, don't hire people to delegate things away. Do you see a difference in the core idea of founder-mode and just like, but you should actually trust your intuition more?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:19:35):
Intuition comes from, in my point of view, a deep understanding of self, and the capacity to get quiet and be well resourced, meaning you've slept well and you've eaten well and you have enough love in your world. And I think what founder-mode can confuse is my intuition says I should just do this job for them and fire these three people. That's not intuition, that's reaction, that's a fear response. And when the founder says, "I sat with this, I felt it out, I can see it. I need to terminate my whole go-to-market team and start over. This isn't working, and I have data that supports it, but I know this isn't working." I'm like, "Let's go with that. I'm in. Let's do it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
And I think you described a lot of times people feel this, and it takes a year, two years, three years, many years to actually realize that. And your advice here is try to listen to that more and trust it more. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Well, Jonathan to pivot our energy, is there anything else want to leave listeners with, last piece of advice, anything that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:21:04):
To be a founder is a state of being. It's an attitude, it's courage, it's instinct, it's a capacity to push through, despite all sorts of evidence suggesting you're wasting your time. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be. And so what I would encourage every founder out there that wants to go build something substantial, go work on your craft in addition to working on the business. Be honest with yourself about here's the shit I'm bad at. I don't know how to read a financial statement. My board meetings suck. Half my meetings that I have with my leadership team we all walk out of there saying what did we just accomplish right now? Or I get to the end of my workday and I'm like, I didn't get anything done. Those are all examples of just not taking the craft seriously enough. I'll leave with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):
I love that. And I think I've made the mistake during our conversation of confusing founder and CEO and assuming they're the same thing, and I really appreciate you just again pointing out to folks that that's the big distinction you got to start making is there's the founder and there's the CEO. Often they're same person, but different parts of your brain and different skill sets.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:36):
And I'm now fully off the very awkward soapbox I've been sitting on for a long time, so we can go to lightning round whenever you're ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:44):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lighting round. Jonathan, are you ready?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:48):
I'm ready. I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:49):
First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:54):
My number one business book that I've recommended would be Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. I do think it always comes back to team. The right team can solve all the things. And that book is a beautiful distillation of the most common problematic archetypes that show up in a leadership group. So that's the number one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):
Amazing. Anything else you'd recommend?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:23:19):
The second one, it goes more personal. It's a book called Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer. It was, at least for me, the first introduction to this idea that I am not my brain and that my brain can be a tool that serves me well, and at times doesn't. So that would be number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):
I've started to read that book and then I never finished it, so this is a good reminder to give it another shot. Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:23:50):
I just watched and really enjoyed, because by the way, I have a three-year-old at home, so the amount of content I now consume is reduced tremendously. Well, my wife and I just watched Will & Harper. This is the documentary between Will Ferrell and his very dear friend who just recently transitioned. They road trip across the country together, and it was freaking delightful. It was sweet and endearing and one of the better things I've watched in a while.

(01:24:19):
TV show, Slow Horses, I'm utterly addicted. I'm only midway through season two, but I've been voraciously sleeping less and watching more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:31):
I love both those. I just watched Will & Harper, and completely agree with your sentiment about it. I wasn't planning to watch it. My mother-in-Law started watching. I'm like, wow, this is really fun. It's also funny, meaningful funny.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:24:43):
There's so many moments in it that are really sweet. As an aside, this was '20, I don't know, April 2020, and a group of our very close friends said, "Hey, how are we going to keep in touch?" And so we started what we called Movie Club, and we routinely either pick a TV show or a movie. We all watch separately and every two weeks we get together on Zoom at night, we talk about what we just watched.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):
I love that.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:07):
And some have been great, some have been terrible. But Will & Harper was our most recent.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):
Oh, such a cool tradition. Okay, we'll keep going. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:21):
Two, and one is I'm going to talk my own book, but I still love it. The first one is Aura Frames. These are digital picture frames. They're amazing. The UX for them is incredible, the quality of it, they're pieces of artwork. So grandparents, in-laws, parents, we have multiple in our house, just love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):
Just to clarify, it's a frame that has picked digital photos and you can give it to your mom and show photos of your kid wherever they live. Is that right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:55):
And the combination of the ease of the software and the quality of the imagery is better than anything I've tried, and I've tried a bunch of them. A-U-R-A Frames, and this is not an Enjoy The Work company. This is just one I'm a giant fan of.

(01:26:08):
The second one is an Enjoy The Work company called Augie Studio. A-U-G-I-E Studio. This is Canva for video. It can turn anyone with no engineering skills whatsoever, no code video creation, with full editing tools. So suddenly you can create branded high fidelity, high quality commercial video in minutes, with no effort. It's amazing. It was built by two media tech co-founders that were building this thing pre-ChatGPT, and it's just growing like this, and it's super fun, and the guys are great. So A-U-G-I-E Studio.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:51):
Sounds amazing. Augie Studio, I could use that. That sounds awesome. Two more questions. I feel like this one's going to be a good one. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work on in life?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:27:04):
The first one, and the one that I probably most commonly refer to, is that there is only one life. The quick backstory, and I know it's a lightning round, but I'm guilty of these stories. I went for a walk with a girlfriend of mine a bunch of years ago. And we did this once a month and we would always have a pretty typical ritual of giving each other life updates to begin the walk. And so I started the conversation with, "So there's the family update and then there's my work life and then there's my social life." She's like, "No, no, no, no, no, stop. That's all bullshit. It's one life. Stop assuming that there are these pretend walls between them or among them." I've lived that ever since.

(01:27:42):
So I try and show up. That phrase lets me show up the same way, no matter my setting. If you and I were having a beer or a meal, or if I'm sitting with one of my co-founders or clients, it doesn't matter, I show up the same way everywhere. Part of the way I enjoy the work is by having a real friendship, a real intimacy with everyone at Enjoy The Work, and including our clients as well, I want that level of conversation. I don't want the sterile stuff over here with my work environment versus my personal versus my family. It's just one version of me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:15):
And the phrase is, it's just one life.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:17):
Just one life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):
It's just one life. Final question. So you ran a casino at one point, I believe, and it was like a Harrah's Casino, is that right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:28):
My first career was in the casino business.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:30):
Okay.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:31):
But before I go on, what's the question?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:32):
The question is just is there a fun story, or experience, or lesson from that time in your life that might be fun to share? Maybe a mob involvement, or cheating, or something? I imagine that's a unique life experience.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:48):
I'll tell one of my favorite family stories then briefly. But yes, my family goes back in casino gambling in one form or another, several generations. My great-grandmother ran a illicit poker game. My grandfather ran numbers out of a gas station. My father's been in the casino industry since Atlantic City in the 70s. My sister is a prominent gaming attorney, and I worked in the industry for a dozen years, so this is my family. And Lenny, I didn't know any of this was weird until I was in my mid 20s.

(01:29:18):
I turned 21, and I'm old, yes, I'm going to just hide the year. I'm kidding. Anyway, I turned 21 and we take a family trip to Las Vegas because that was normal for us. My father was doing a lot of work out there, so he got us hotel rooms, etc. I'd never been there before, and I was newly 21 and so my parents said, "You have $300 to gamble with. We're going to be here for five days." This is a vacation. My grandparents are coming in. My uncle and aunt were coming in, and they're encouraging me, "This is all up to you, but try not to lose it all on night number one," which was good advice to give me. I was 21 and I was pretty much a schmuck at the time. But also, part of my experience being there was to interview for a summer internship. I was a college going to be junior.

(01:30:06):
So we go and I immediately go sit at some table and start playing some games. And I turn $300 into a few thousand dollars in the very first evening. And that was exciting and it was crazy and it was wild, et cetera. On the third night, which happens to everyone who goes to Vegas for too long, we're all delirious because all of us are staying up all night and being silly and being stupid. And my parents ask me, by the way, this is pre-cell phones, they ask me, "Hey, can you stay awake? Your uncle and aunt are going to arrive late tonight. They'll call the room. You can come down and just greet them and say hello?" Sure. So I get the phone call like 11: 30 at night. Go on downstairs, they're here. I go downstairs in the casino floor. We're staying at the Las Vegas Hilton. It's since been renamed, but I go downstairs and I can't find them anywhere. I think, okay, well I have cash in my pocket and I'm now awake so I might as well gamble.

(01:30:53):
Shortly thereafter, Lenny, I have an experience that happens one in 369,000 occurrences, and I win $35,421.92. For the trip I ended up winning $40,000 that I turned $300 to, and I was just 21 years old, which has left me with one of my mantras that I've had for the rest of my life, which some people roll their eyes at, but that is gambling does pay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:20):
I love that you remember the exact amount. What games did you end up playing that helped you win so much money?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:31:27):
The primary game that I played was Caribbean Stud Poker, where there's no skill of any kind. You get five cards, the dealer gets five cards, whoever wins wins, and if you have particularly unusual hands you get odds on the hand. And I got dealt 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of spades in five cards.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:44):
I thought you'd say slots or something. I love that you're just sitting there playing poker and went from $300 to $40,000.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:31:51):
It's not even real poker.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:53):
That was a great story. I'm glad I went there. Jonathan, this was incredible. I think we've helped a lot of founders through this conversation. Two final questions. Where can folks find you guys? Who would be a good fit? What should people know about Enjoy the Work? And finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:32:10):
Love that. So let me unpack those three. The first one is enjoythework.com, or just find me on LinkedIn. I'm not hard to find. Send us a note.

(01:32:22):
Who should ping us is very simple. If you're a founder out there, or a CEO out there, and you know in your heart that there's some gap between how you're running the business and how the company's going, and how it could be going, and how you could be running the business, if there's some gap there, we're here to help. Now our expertise, as we talked about in this call, is company building. So if you just have an idea on a napkin or you have a science experiment that you're not sure, we're useless, that's not us. But if you have some breadcrumbs worth following, like the business is starting to work, you're a series A into B and beyond, and you know that there's better, you can see it, that's where we help. Send us a note. Love to chat.

(01:33:06):
How can listeners be useful to us? So we are ferocious readers. All we try and do is study how do the best startups do X? From tiny things, like how do they run all hands meetings or off sites to the big meta topics of what is going to repeatable go-to-market even mean? Or what is financial planning in a way that's useful? Or how do you set goals that won't make you roll your eyes? We consistently learn from the ecosystem of podcasters and authors and journalists, like, go look at this material. So if your listeners have a favorite X on whatever topic in running a startup, send them my way. All we love to do is read and chew on that stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:54):
Awesome. And the best way to send that is either through Enjoy the Work or LinkedIn.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:33:58):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):
Awesome. Jonathan, thank you so much for being here.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:34:02):
Lenny, this was so damn fun. Thanks for listening to my crazy casino stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:07):
I want to hear more, but we got to go. Bye everyone.

# Competing with giants: An inside look at how The Browser Company builds product | Josh Miller (CEO)

## Transcript

Josh Miller (00:00:00):
We want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details. For other people, it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering headcount. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you get it. You give them a very exciting, ambitious product and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Josh Miller. Josh is the CEO and co-founder of a company called The Browser Company, which makes a product called Arc, which has quickly become my default web browser. I fell in love with this product as soon as I started using it and wanted to get a glimpse into how Josh and his team approached the craft of product. There's this cohort of companies like the Browser Company, [inaudible 00:01:09], a few others that are just laser focused on building the best possible user experience, almost above all else. And I wanted to spend some time exploring this trend with Josh. We cover how he thinks about prioritization, team building, storytelling, company values, metrics, shipping, building in public so much more.

(00:01:28):
Josh is such an earnest, genuine and humble human, and it was such a pleasure getting to learn from him. And, just to be clear, I'm not an investor in the Browser Company and I barely knew anything about the company before I chatted with Josh. So, I'm just a fan. And as a special surprise, Arc is normally invite only. But if you're listening to this now, check the show notes for a special link that'll get you right in to use the browser, if you want to play with it yourself. With that, I bring you Josh Miller after a short word from our select sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:57):
Josh, welcome to the podcast.

Josh Miller (00:03:59):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:00):
It's absolutely my pleasure. You are the CEO and co-founder of The Browser Company, which builds a product called Arc. Can you just talk about what is The Browser Company? What is Arc? And then whatever you can share about just like the scale of Arc at this point. That'd be really interesting to hear.

Josh Miller (00:04:15):
Sure. I hope you don't mind me doing this. I'm curious, I hear that you may, may or may not use Arc? How would you describe Arc to somebody?

Lenny (00:04:25):
The simple explanation is it's just the best web browser that I've used. So, to me it's a browser. I know that you have a bigger vision than that, but that's the way I see it as a layperson who hasn't seen the full vision.

Josh Miller (00:04:38):
Awesome. I think we can go home now. That's great. That's awesome.

Lenny (00:04:39):
There we go.

Josh Miller (00:04:39):
No. To be totally honest with you and your listeners, we have a really hard time describing Arc, which is something I'm not proud of. But it is, objectively, a replacement for your default web browser. And people who try it seem to really love it, and most people seem to have a hard time using the internet in the old way. So, that may sound like I'm being coy, but we have work shopped many a one-liners and the words have escaped us so far. So, to be honest, it is on our to-do list to get sharper about that.

(00:05:15):
And then in terms of our scale, since we have a lot of product managers listening, I'll give you the PM answer to that question, which is, we really focus on one key metric as it relates to tracking our growth or how we are doing. We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric. You can't game it. Right? So from retention perspective, it's not just opening it accidentally once a week. You need to open a tab on a day in order to count as an active for a day.

(00:06:01):
But so it tracks retention. It tracks engagement because five days a week is no joke. There are very few apps or pieces of software you actively use five days a week. And then, obviously, it tracks growth, because of we track the count. So that is what we track. And then we also don't obsess over absolute numbers, because if we're successful, if you zoom out and out and out, any point in time will be inconsequential and small. So, what we really look is growth rate week over week. So, relative to last week, what is our growth rate? And for the past eight months or so, we've been growing over 10% every single week. So very, very thrilled with that. Do not think that will continue If anyone is listening. I would be shocked if we continue like that for another eight months. But, yeah. We obsess over how many humans use Arc five out of seven days a week. And we really want that number to grow as fast as possible every single week.

Lenny (00:06:54):
I love that we're already talking about metrics and retention. This is off to a good start.

Josh Miller (00:06:57):
You got to know your audience. Lenny.

Lenny (00:06:59):
We're going to talk about just how public you're about everything. But would you be for sharing your retention actual numbers? The D5 and D7 you just mentioned?

Josh Miller (00:07:07):
Yes. With the asterisk that I didn't prepare for that. So, Rebecca correct me on Twitter after this, if this is wrong. So once again, we don't look at DAU retention. We don't look at weekly active-user retention. We really just look at D5 D7 retention. Depending on the cohort, that's somewhere between low to mid-30s and low 40s. So really, really fantastic. Again, not going to continue. If there is anyone on this call that is going to check this in a year, it will be lower I'm sure. But so far, we're really thrilled with it.

(00:07:37):
And most importantly, in the same way, we don't look at absolute gross growth number, we don't look at retention in this moment. We look at, is it improving cohort by cohort? And so, what I think I am most proud of is that, if you go back a year, by all means our retention curve, we were really proud of it. And I think one of the best in our category of software. But, what I'm really proud of is, 12 months later we've been inching it up and up and up, despite getting further away from the earliest most passionate adopters. So, our retention curve's going up and up a little bit, which is-

Lenny (00:08:11):
All right. All right. If you haven't shared that, that'd be cool to share on Twitter someday. I'm a retained user.

Josh Miller (00:08:15):
I'm going to wait and you can share this clip. We'll share this clip.

Lenny (00:08:18):
Okay. Okay. I love it. We're just ready. We got the marketing strategy coming together. So, I told you this ahead of the chat, but the reason I wanted to have you on this podcast, even though, as folks may know, and as I've told you, I try to actually avoid founders and CEOs on this podcast to give other folks a platform who aren't often invited on podcasts. But the reason I wanted to have you on is, I just feel like Arc is a remarkable product. It blew me away the first time I used it. I don't know if you saw it, I tweeted as soon as I signed up? I had to share how awesome it was. I was like-

Josh Miller (00:08:47):
Of course I saw it. It made my day.

Lenny (00:08:48):
Okay. Okay, great. And, also as an outside observer, it just feels like you're building remarkable culture and team that's really unique. And, so I just want to selfishly learn from how you think about product and team building and all the things that go into it. So yeah.

Josh Miller (00:09:03):
Thanks for saying that, Lenny. What a cool way to kick off an interview.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Absolutely. First question I have along those lines is, you mentioned at some point that your product building philosophy is a reaction to the traditional Silicon Valley way of building product. I'm curious to hear what led you down that road? Why did you feel like you had to react to it? And then how would you just describe your product building philosophy at The Browser Company?

Josh Miller (00:09:27):
I'll share this caveat once and never again in this interview. But I want anyone listening to know, I'm someone who doesn't believe there is a single right way to do things. So, what I'm sharing today is truly just what we have found works for us in this moment for what we are doing. But, I remember when I was earlier in my career, I'd listen to podcasts like this and take it as dogma, because there are these people that had done it and I respected what they'd built. So, if any of this sounds like "better than thou," it's not intended to. This is just what we found works for us and what we care about. [inaudible 00:09:59].

(00:09:58):
Okay. So early in my career started a company also with Hursh, my current co-founder and CTO. We were fortunate enough to have that company acquired or acqui-hired by Facebook and spent a number of years working at Facebook. And remarkable organization, probably the best executing I've ever seen at that period of time. And, by the way, I'd never been a PM before, so I'm not complimenting myself, I was just learning for the first time. But what struck me at Facebook in call it 2014, and I've seen through to this day, is Silicon Valley, at least the most modern version of Silicon Valley, has this obsession with graphs, and has this obsession with numbers and metrics.

(00:10:36):
I mean, you saw me in the previous answer, I'm talking about D5, D7. What's a D5, D7? And, it is an incredibly effective way to achieve certain outcomes, to focus on numbers, because it's very quantitative, it's objective. You can see the graph go up or go down, or stay flat depending on what you want. But what we've found is that optimizing for metrics leaves a lot on the table and it misses a lot. And so, what we do at The Browser Company is we talk about optimizing feelings. How do we want to make someone feel on the other end of our software? Do we want to make them feel joy? Do we want to make them feel fast? Do we want to make them feel organized? Do we want to make them feel focused? What is it the feeling we are trying to evoke in whatever we're doing on a specific project, or a specific feature, or a specific piece of storytelling content?

(00:11:31):
And I can imagine what's going through the heads of your listeners right now, which is probably a number of things. But among others, that sounds really damn romantic. If they're like, "Okay. You optimizing for feelings." But if you allow me, I would posit that actually this modern way of optimizing for numbers and graphs, especially for what we all do every day, which is make things and put in the world, is what's fairly odd. Because, if you just to yourself daydream about, what are your favorite products or product companies and brands, while it may sound cliche for me, Nike. Nike was one of the first companies that at a very deep level resonate with me as a child. Disney? Disney, same thing. Apple? Before I was a professional in an industry, these were the brands and the products that they made that really made me love something that was ostensibly a commercial product I could buy.

(00:12:29):
What do you think Walt Disney was optimizing for when he was crafting Disneyland? What do you think Phil Knight was thinking about when he made that first version of the Nike running shoe? What do you think Steve Jobs was imagining and daydreaming about when thinking about the iPhone or the Macintosh? By all means, numbers are a fantastic way to be honest with yourself about whether or not you are achieving what you aim to do. But at the moment of creation, at the stage as product people, wondering what should we do, and why, and how? We think it's much more important for us to think about the human, the person at the other end, and how we really want to make them feel.

(00:13:10):
I think one tangible example of that is when I was at Facebook, I joined in the midst of Snapchat's ascendancy. And, there was a lot of feelings about how are we doing, should we be worried? And the way that we would have that conversation would be, how many times per week do people share on Facebook? Do they post something? We even had an acronym OBPS. It's like seared into my memory. What is OBPS? And how is it trending over time? Well, I think we should have been asking, and what we at least would ask at The Browser Company and our way of product development is, "Do we think people feel closer to their friends and family?" Or something of that nature?

(00:13:52):
I think that's what Snapchat got so right. They weren't obsessing about something like, "How many people put an image into the composer and hit the plus button. And the number of times per week means success." They were thinking about something much more human and essential. And so, that is what we've [inaudible 00:14:07] The Browser Company. Don't optimize for metrics, don't optimize for graphs. Use that as a way to keep you honest, and use it as a tool in your toolkit. But fundamentally, none of us are here for that. We're there to make people feel something.

Lenny (00:14:19):
As you pointed out, I think a lot of the people are listening are like, "I love that. I wish I could do that. I want to optimize for feelings, but then I got to drive the business forward. I got goals to hit. I want to keep people accountable." I'm curious how you operationalize this approach? How do you actually implement this idea? I imagine you still have goals and metrics and you guys, you talked about retention and things like that.

Josh Miller (00:14:42):
Yeah. Obviously it's difficult to do that in the abstract for another company, and it may not work for every company and every product. But, for example, one of the reasons we found this to be so effective so far is, if you pick the right feeling, it typically tracks pretty closely with the metric you care about. So, for example, we don't have a growth team and we have no semblance of growth projects. However, in many of the new features that we put out into the world, we want people to feel surprise or joy or an emotion like that. Guess what? When people feel that way, they go, "Oh, my God, what was that?" And they start telling their friends and family about it, and they start dropping a screenshot in Slack, et cetera. So, there's one example on the consumer side. I've never built traditional enterprise software selling to CIOs, et cetera. But I can imagine maybe someone in the IT department of a large enterprise wants to feel smart, or wants to feel ahead of the curve or wants to feel secure and ease at what they're doing.

(00:15:54):
I think sometimes we just forget that whoever your buyer is, or whatever your business objective, at the end of the day we're a bunch of people in a bunch of rooms at the other side of these screens. And just thinking about that person, it could be a buyer, it could be a customer. But I think the truth is the answer to the question Lenny is, when I was earlier in my career, I was searching for the answers or the way to do things, the right, the wrong, the binary. I think anyone that's been doing this or anything for a while learns that it's all nuanced. It's a spectrum. It depends. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

(00:16:26):
But I think the true answer, Lenny, is just optimizing for metrics so purely is deeply flawed in my opinion. Optimizing for feelings so purely is flawed as well. And it depends on what you are doing, what the project is and a lot of other things. But I think the reason we come out so strongly is, I do think Silicon Valley has tended so far towards optimizing for graphs and metrics, that if we can reel it back in a little bit, at least as just one company, I think that will be good. But the truth is, it's both. We need to use all the tools we can get, but I think hopefully that's one way that people can operationalize.

Lenny (00:17:05):
I'm curious, just to poke out a little bit, how you actually implement that? So maybe as an example, you recently launched this Peek feature, where you mouse over, I think, a link and it opens up in a little browser that doesn't last. Do you put together a little spec of some sort of, "We're trying to create surprise, and maybe here's a metric we think about it." What's actual day-to-day operational approach to a new feature, in terms of feelings versus metrics?

Josh Miller (00:17:32):
Yeah. The truth is I don't think we've operationalized it as formally as we should one day. And we'll probably need to one day. The lucky thing is we are a very tight group of individuals that have now worked together for a long time. So not so formal as there's a PRD at the top of it, we list out the emotions. It's much more, with that project, get Ben in a room and whoever else is working on it and say, "All right. So here's what we're trying to do for people. Here's the problem we're trying to solve or the way we fit in their day. And in that moment people want to feel very light and airy."

(00:18:05):
So, for the Peek feature [inaudible 00:18:07] he's referencing the use cases. You're on Hacker News and you want to probably in pretty quick succession check out five to seven URLs. And you're not really sure which one you're going to spend time on, but you're going to open a bunch of stuff really quickly. And Peek allows you to effortlessly just peek into it, without leaving Hacker News and context switching to this whole new tab and going back and forth. So in that scenario, the conversation was how do we make it feel really airy and effortless to just whoop, pop it up, pop it back down, lightness, airiness, speed, agility. So again, it's not that we have a, "What is the number one feeling and the number two feeling?" It is much more conversational at this stage, but I am actually really excited. Hopefully we got the privilege one day to have such a large team that we have to figure out a way to do it. So, that's an example of how we think about it.

Lenny (00:18:57):
It's a good segue to a question I wanted to touch on. So, I asked Scott Belsky what I should ask you. He's a big fan of yours. I don't know if he's an investor? But he's just like, "I love Josh." And asked him, "What should I ask Josh?" And one of his questions was about, you guys ship very quickly. You're shipping meaningful features every Friday. And you also close the loop really well with customers when they come ask for something. You're like, "Hey, here. We did it." What is it that you do, and what can people learn from the way you all operate that allows you to ship quickly?

Josh Miller (00:19:26):
Well, first of all, thank you Scott, if you're listening. It's somewhat of an awkward question admittedly, because it's like someone complimenting you about your product. It's always impossible to really take and accept the compliment, because you see all the blemishes. Of course we see all these ways in which we don't ship fast enough and could be doing a better job listening and building with members. But, at risk of sounding a bit cliche, I really think we ship our values. So, we thought a lot about our values as a company. You can read about them online. And I think if you examine those values and then you look at your compliment or Scott's compliment, you can see [inaudible 00:20:05] one-to-one. So the first, and I really think the most important is, we hire people that show up with heartfelt intensity.

(00:20:11):
And, a lot of companies I think obsess over craft details. They'll be a value like, "We obsess over the details." What we say is, we want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details, for other people it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering head count. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you give them a very exciting, ambitious prompt and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work. So, showing up with heartfelt intensity.

(00:20:54):
Our second value is assume you don't know. Assume you don't know. And the value "assume you don't know" is, even if you're a subject matter expert. We have someone in our company that literally built the first version of Chrome and ran it for 16 years. But he more than anyone embodies this beginner's mind of, "I have no idea how this should work or what will happen." And the follow up to that value is, "So we got to get going." It's like dropping in a new city. You just got to walk out the door of your Airbnb turn left and ... Maybe you'll turn right and then you'll hop on the subway, but you just got to get going and see what you find. And so, we have this attitude of, you're showing up with this heartfelt intensity. But you start by saying, "I've no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going to happen." So we've just got to get going. And that biases in a default to action.

(00:21:44):
We have another value of, start by asking, "What could be?", which is pushing ourselves to be as aspirational, ambitious as possible. So the Peek feature that you mentioned, we just didn't want to solve the problem of context switching. We wanted to almost blur the line between native and web software, and make it feel like a sheet of paper. And really pushing ourselves to be as ambitious as we can be, which is the consequence of blowing back around and more deeply motivating the people working on it.

(00:22:13):
So, I mean, I could keep going. We have a value, "You're doing it for the crew when you got to swarm. When you got to swarm," and we have value of, "make them feel something." But I think what it all adds up to is, a team that has a lot of heart, has a lot of intrinsic motivation and a, "It's the first day of my career. I wonder what's going to happen?" attitude. And I think all of those things add up to a culture which is, "Let's get something out there. Let's see what happens."

Lenny (00:22:46):
How did you come up with these? What was the process to come up with company values? Because I know a lot of companies are like, "We should come up with these." How do you do that?

Josh Miller (00:22:54):
The secret is I hate corporate values. I've never resonated with them. And I'm fortunate, we're fortunate enough, to have a lot of really spectacular, experienced leaders in our corner. And I got hammered to the first year, two years on, "Josh, where are your values? How can your team operate without values?" And I always experienced them on the other end as almost corporate propaganda, these cliche fortune cookie, Panda Express-like, "You should care about the detail." It didn't resonate with me. And the thing that clicked was maybe a year and a half, two years into working, I just kept hearing the same things from the team. And I would do things like a year into someone joining, "How's it going? What's going well? What's not?" And I realized that there are some traits that define our team, extremely organically and naturally. No one told people what our values were.

(00:23:51):
Again, because I was this naive, ignorant 31-year-old being like, "Values are a corporate, late-stage capitalism creation," and just very, very hardheaded. And it was really special two years in, hearing from the team why they love The Browser Company, why they think we're doing ... Just the passion there. And then we challenged ourselves to what became a value. Well, if something about the five one-liners on the corporate webpage feels off, start by asking what could be in dream a little bit. And what I realized was, all of the statements people would say about what they loved about The Browser Company, what they thought defined the way we work, they reminded me of how I like to take road trips. I'm a big traveler. I'm a big fan of dropping in somewhere new and just exploring. And so we just had this "Aha!" Moment. Let's, instead of having a corporate landing page with five value titles and subtitles, let's write a manual for how to take a road trip.

(00:24:54):
So we wrote an essay called "Notes on Road Trips" that use this semi-biographical, but mostly fictional, story about a person and their father taking a road trip when they're a teenager, to tell the story of how we do things at The Browser Company. And share these values, but in a way that hopefully won't feel so propagandary and feel a little more, you're reading an essay. So I say that, again, not to say there's anything wrong with traditional values. I'm actually sure I'm going to get an earful for a lot of people that coach me and give me advice that I sounded too indignant on this podcast. But I'm pretty proud of that story because it was a great example of assuming you don't know. We were sure that corporate values were not for us. And then very organically without trying it turned out, "Wait! They run through this company in a pretty profound way. We should put some words around it, because it's happening whether or not we like it, or say it is or not."

Lenny (00:25:49):
That's awesome. I have the page here and it's quite beautiful. And, pulling to it in the show notes just very briefly and tactically, did you just sit down and start writing this thing and then people gave you feedback? How long did this process take? Just for folks that maybe you want to go down this road?

Josh Miller (00:26:03):
Yeah. Warning downside of this process that it takes a lot longer than we thought it would, because we put so much heart into it. So, what it started with was again, in my natural one-year, check-in type conversation, starting to notice these patterns. And then we actually very comprehensively were like, "Okay. Let's sit down and interview everyone at The Browser Company. But no survey. One by one, talking to people, asking questions. And then we pulled out those words. So, actually what's really cool about these values, if my memory serves me, I believe every single one, with the exception of maybe a word or two, was something that someone on our team said. So we interviewed the entire team and then these are meant to be a mirror. The putting it in road trip essay form? That took a long time. That that was a lot of ... Yeah. I don't recommend the way that we did that, but-

Lenny (00:27:02):
How long is long?

Josh Miller (00:27:03):
Probably three months.

Lenny (00:27:06):
Oh. That does not sound that long. Okay.

Josh Miller (00:27:07):
Yeah. Maybe this goes back to Scott's comment that maybe our bar to how quickly we should ship stuff including values is, it's like I don't know. But, yeah. It felt like a long time. And this was not just me. Just for anyone listening, this was not CEO in a corner writing a missive. This was a team effort. There's a woman Abby on our team that did so much work on this project. The words themselves came from our team. So, it has my name I think somewhere on that webpage, but by no means was this me writing this essay in a corner with the fireplace on, or anything like that.

Lenny (00:27:40):
Okay. Awesome. That was really helpful. As you also saw, I asked on Twitter what to ask you, and I got a ton of questions. People have a lot of questions for how y'all do stuff. The most common question turned out was from Ched Khan who had the most likes of all the questions that people asked you. And it was around hiring, that basically you've been able to convince some of the most amazing people in the world to join The Browser Company. Like you just mentioned, you hired the guy that built Chrome, basically, to work on Arc now. What is it that you do that convinces amazing people to join? Because everyone wants to learn from you and copy you, and do that themselves.

Josh Miller (00:28:15):
Thank you for that question and for all the legs. I will admit, this is also a fairly awkward one to ask. I actually just came from an interview with a candidate and they asked me a fairly similar question. And I said, "You know what? You should go ask the people that work here. It's not me. I don't know why they ultimately join." But what I will tell you is, the intentionality, which is another secret, sharing a lot of secrets. This one will probably get me in trouble. I don't care about web browsers. I've never cared about web browsers. I never wanted to build a web browser. If you had told me a decade ago that I'd be working on a desktop first web browser at 32, "I'd say what in my career went horribly wrong?" The origin story of this company was Hursch, who I met when I was 20. We started a company together. Lots of mistakes, a lot of successes, a lot of growing pains and figured out who we are. And a decade later we were still friends, we went to each other's weddings.

(00:29:10):
We'd worked in all these different industries and different-stage companies and we just realized, "You know what? There are a lot of ideas that get us really excited. There are a lot of shapes and sizes." But as we were nostalgic for looking back on the decade prior, it was groups of people and moments in time with those people that were our best memories. And so, what Hursch and I decided, long before the company started was, we want to build a company, but we want to build a company where we feel like we can hire whoever we want. And I don't mean whoever we want in terms of who would dare say no. But we want to work on something where the greatest minds in our industry and adjacent would want to work on that prompt in a hypothetical sense. And then build an organization, build a team where we can work in the way that, after a decade of trying on a bunch of hats and ways of doing things and metrics this and [inaudible 00:30:04], we could do what was right for us.

(00:30:06):
And so, where we went to with a new web browser, let alone a web browser as a new form of computing, which is our true aspiration, to build an internet here. You can look up the internet computer YouTube video on our Browser Company YouTube page. But our ambition's even higher than a web browser. The intention of that is, we just want to go hire our favorite people that we know and don't know and build a team that, we'll never get bored working with this crew, because of how incredible they are and how humble they are. And so, when you think about it like that, I as the CEO as notionally the head of product, I view our product as our team. And I know a lot of companies say that. I actually think they probably all mean it. I don't think anyone's being disingenuous, but we really meet it. It is the genesis of this company.

(00:30:55):
It is not a new web browser. It is, let's build the dream team, our dream team. And let's build a way of working that is really fun for us and really speaks to our values. And let's go find people that resonate with that. And that trickles down to everything we do, whether it's our policy about this or the way we do that. I'll give you one example. Our goal of interviews is to convince people not to join The Browser Company. If I have an interview with someone, I don't pitch them and say, "What do you want to ask me? Anything you want? I'll be super honest, most people shouldn't want to work here." So I think it all starts with us viewing our product as the company, as the team, not Arc itself. And then, I think being self-aware, that that's how I think that's how we think.

(00:31:43):
But again, flying back things that I've heard, we have been fortunate. We've hired a lot of really remarkable people, especially on paper and especially off. I mean, all around. I'll just give a couple examples to share one thing that I've heard. A few recent hires, we hired someone named Darren who, as I mentioned, he co-created the first prototype of Chrome and then ran it for 16 years. I think hundreds if not thousands of people reported to him. He joined the Browser Company as an IC. We just hired a woman named Tara. She was on the original Paper by 53 team, one of my most inspiring products at the beginning of my career. Most recently she was actually, I believe, Senior SVP of product at Vimeo and a senior director of engineering. She joined our engineering team as an IC. We just hired someone named Peter Vidani. When I was 20 building consumer social software, he was the coolest, most impressive person. He was the first designer at Tumblr. Ran the design team at Tumblr for seven years and the most recently was SVP of design at Slack. Joined the team as an IC designer.

(00:32:48):
And though that sounds like I'm bragging, the thing that was really interesting and perplexing to us was, these are people that have made a lot of money, that have had really fancy titles, that have worked on transformative projects. Why are they joining this team? And I think something that people show up to The Browser Company with is, in addition to heartfelt intensity, this aspiration that their work at The Browser Company will come to define their careers. And that's coming from people that have done really remarkable things, by all accounts. And I think more than anything, we've realized that, in order for people like that to join and to show up with that, there are a number of things you have to promise and provide them, that make folks like that gravitate with the intention of doing their work of their career, ranging from an incredible and ambitious aspiration, really empowerment to act on the prompts that they're given on behalf of the team in the way that they see fit, and truly trusting and empowering them.

(00:33:54):
A very kind culture. I think if you've been doing this for a decade plus, your intolerance for bullshit is very, very low. And so, by no means do I think we're perfect. I don't think everyone shows up The Browser Company saying, "If I'm not on the equivalent of the early iPhone team, I'm going to be bummed." But I think generally speaking, Hursh and I, and everyone that was on the early team showed up with this aspiration of making The Browser Company the product. And I think that's carried forward to this tumbleweed of people saying, "[inaudible 00:34:23]. That's where I'm going to finally do the equivalent of building the iPhone." And we all know we probably won't, but there is that, "I want to give it one more shot. I want to go for it." And that just tumbleweeds, I think, at some point.

Lenny (00:34:37):
That tumbleweed is, I think a big part of it is, once you get amazing people, more amazing people want to join. So I think that's very much helpful. Something else this resonates a lot with is, just the mission of a company is such a powerful tool for pulling people in, the best people. I've seen that a lot with founders. If they have a meaningful mission, it's so much easier to hire, versus not. And clearly you're really good at sharing that vision and mission. And then you also have a really interesting mission and vision. I think there's also, you're just a charismatic founder and that helps a lot too. And you're a great storyteller.

Josh Miller (00:35:08):
Well, the other thing I want to add Lenny is, again putting myself in the listener, I imagine a lot of what I just said probably sounded a little bit ... Could come off, if you don't know me and you don't, as a little bombastic or a little again romantic. Very tactically, I'll give you something that was just who we are, but I think has helped contribute to this tumbleweed. From the very first person we hired, we celebrated them publicly. The fact that they joined. And in a very heartfelt way, telling you about them as a person and what they did. Long before we had anyone that anyone would've heard of before working at The Browser Company, just because it was earnest, we were really proud. Again, if you think of our original mandate as building the companies, the product, when our first designer joins, we want to tell everyone about it. That's a product launch. That is the product launch.

(00:35:57):
And then, whenever we ship something, we go out of our way to celebrate the people that worked on it publicly. I think there's a CEO-hero worship sometimes in Silicon Valley. I do very little at the company. Or sorry. I do very little as it relates to the thing people fall in love with Arc. I do a lot for The Browser Company, but I don't make Arc. I didn't make Peek. And again, that's just who we are, which is, "Alexandre. She killed me! Look at how cool this is!" because it's earnest and it's honest to who we are. And then I think it creates this reinforcing cycle of you're someone that's done something incredible, which is, "I'm going to be celebrated. They truly want me here. I'm going to be recognized for the work that I do.

(00:36:39):
It's not going to just accrue to this like CEO figurehead who everyone thinks is some genius visionary. And so again, by no means are we perfect. By no means do I think we get it right all the time. But, because it's such an authentic expression of who we are and what we were trying to do, I think we do little micro implementations like that, that ladder up to that principle I got so excited about but are as simple as someone tweets about some animation. They're like, "Woo! This was fun." Tag Sherry. Sherry made that, Sherry's incredible. And you don't see that that much in Silicon Valley. You see corporate blog posts and the CEOs more than anyone else. That's probably why you don't have CEOs on the podcast, because you don't want ... You know this Lenny. That is why that's your policy. You don't want to hear from the CEOs. They're not the ones building the product. You want to hear from the people actually doing it. That's why I love this podcast.

Lenny (00:37:26):
That's right. That's right. Thank you. I'd say just hearing everything you're saying, The Browser Company sounds like an incredible place to work. I could see why people want to go work. It's pretty simple. You touched on being public and sharing everything that's going on. And that's another area I wanted to spend a little time on. You guys are very transparent about what's going on and inside the company. You bring cameras into the board meetings. I watched a half-hour meeting you had with your head of design talking about a project that's behind scheduling. You're trying to figure out how do we get this out the door. You just share actual things you all are doing within the company, publicly. And I'm curious just, why did you start doing that? What have you seen as a good or bad that has come from that? Is there anything you've shared that maybe you regret like "Oh, maybe we shouldn't have put that out there." What's been your experience with that?

Josh Miller (00:38:17):
Why don't I start with the regret. It's not yet a regret, but the thing that I wonder ... Because this is very much ... I may have hopefully spoken with a lot of earnest passion to some of the questions before. This is one that I would really characterize as a prototype. We really have a prototype-driven culture. And this is one that I'd put high on the list of, "Maybe we'll regret this later." And specifically what I hope is that, I'm uncomfortable putting myself too central in our story. But, naturally, when you're doing storytelling publicly, there's a gravitational pull for the CEO and the founders to be at the center of that. And so, sometimes even this morning, we had our best-performing YouTube video ever. The first one that really broke out of people that already follow us. And it's a reaction video in classic YouTube form to MKBHD talking about our product for the first time.

(00:39:13):
And I honestly watched it right before this again, and I was like, "What the fuck am I doing? What are we doing? Why am I trying to become a YouTuber?" So, to be totally honest, I don't regret anything yet. But I wonder if we could take this too far? So if anyone's listening, if you see us starting to take this too far, especially as it relates to me, we want to hear about it, because that's keeping me up. But I do think the intentions are pure and earnest, which are ... And another thing that defines people that have joined The Browser Company, in addition to wanting to do the work that defines their careers, is I would characterize it as a little bit of hopelessness, maybe feeling jaded, questioning this industry that they've worked on or products that they've worked on and wanting to rediscover. But, at the end of the day, we are a group of idealists, of optimists, wanting to rediscover what we fell in love with when we were kids, whether it's the part of our craft or the potential of technology, the internet and software.

(00:40:19):
And, as part of that, I would view Arc and the Browser Company as an experiment in we can do it. Better is possible. And as we were thinking about better as possible, rediscovering what we love and believe in deep down and trying to express it in the world, one of it related to trust. I remember when I was a teenager using the internet for the first time and early on to college, just the hopefulness of what was possible, and the belief that these people building these tools, they were like heroes to me. Not just the leaders, but the teams, the companies, the brands. And somewhere along the way, I'm not blaming a single company, I'm not even saying that anyone did anything wrong, but culturally ... I was a sociology major. Culturally, we have lost trust in tech companies and in tech brands.

(00:41:10):
And so, building in public showing you our meetings, uncomfortably so, is an act in, "If we were them, why should they trust us? Why should anyone trust us?" We have your most sensitive personal data. We have your most sensitive professional data. Why should you trust us if we've had our trust broken again and again? And I think our hypothesis in this prototype, in this experiment is, we can have the best privacy policy in the world, but at the end of the day, again, it's just people behind the screen. And so, even if I think about ... I haven't done interviews like this, because I worry that if you don't know me, I come off the wrong way.

(00:41:51):
A lot of people tend to. I've noticed a lot of friends in my life that I know them behind the scenes, but the way that people perceive them publicly here don't know them. They interpret it the other way, because there's not that trust. And so our bet is that if you get to know us, Nash, Dina, me Hursch, and you really feel like you get to know us as person and all of our imperfections, we're average looking, we're average to all that stuff. Then when you see that we're asking for a permission, you might trust it is because we want to make you feel a certain way that's better. And if not ... I'll say someone tweeted something yesterday, who apparently we didn't earn the trust yet and they haven't gone to know us. And their interpretation of what we were doing was the worst possible interpretation you could [inaudible 00:42:40]. And, at first honestly, I felt a bit of anger, like, "Who was this person on a Thursday just saying we're doing X and Y?" And then I realized, "You know what? I'd have the same feeling because of the experiences I've had with technology in the past five to 10 years."

(00:42:53):
And so, the intention with these the building and public experiments are radical trust building. Not radical transparency, we can't share everything, but radical trust building. You get to know us as humans and I worry that we'll regret that, and that it could potentially turn into, "Oh, they're trying to be internet celebrities that they're so important, they should share everything because ... Thank you, them, for gracing us with their opinions." It's not the intention and it feels worth taking that risk. But that's the intentionality behind it.

Lenny (00:43:24):
That is a really interesting insight. It makes a lot of sense for a browser to find that so important, to build that trust.

Josh Miller (00:43:31):
I haven't done podcast interviews, I haven't done this. I really like you. I really like the feeling of your conversations, the intentions behind them, the warmth, even your intro music is a friendly jig. So, I mean, it's a great example, where I think it's one of the most wonderful things about the podcasting medium is I've had you in my ear for a year and the people on your show and you feel a sense of trust in you and your intentions here. And your intentions both in this interview, in terms of what you're trying to do for listeners. To some extent your show, and the warmth that you bring to it and the perception I have as a human being ... We've never met. We've maybe DM'd briefly, maybe five messages exchanged. But I feel like I know you and that makes me trust you. And so, in many ways this podcast, at a meta level's an inspiration for it.

Lenny (00:44:23):
I feel the same way in reverse. You made this point about being worried about being two front and center for your company. I have the same exact feeling. Even though my newsletter's called "Lenny's Newsletter," I only named it that because that was the default recommendation when I was signing up for Substack. I didn't want to be this, "I know it all. Come to me. Welcome to my know-it-all place." I really dislike that. And that's why I created this community that lives along the side, where people can help each other, because I'm not going to have all answers. And so, I've had to lead into that. "All right, people." They want a person to help them understand what's going on, learn about ... And in your videos you do a great job highlighting other people. I was watching your board meeting video and it's like, "Here's all team members coming along. Here they come. How are you doing?" So, anyway. All that to say, you're doing a great job finding the balance.

Josh Miller (00:45:14):
Oh, thank you. You as well.

Lenny (00:45:15):
I appreciate it. You talked about storytelling, and you mentioned that you have a whole bunch of odd teams at The Browser Company. One of them is a storytelling team. And that actually explains, I think, how you're so good at making these really amazing videos, because making great videos is hard. Can you just talk about some of these odd teams that you have, that probably other companies don't?

Josh Miller (00:45:34):
One of the other things that, hopefully, you're picking up in this interview, so far, is we are a very prototype-driven culture. It goes back to the "assume you don't know" ethos. We try a lot of experiments, and we try them related to product features related to how we work together, related to the stories we tell. So, this isn't a category of, "I'm not sure it's going to work, but we're trying it," and it seems to be working so far, at least for us. What Lenny's referencing is, we have a handful of teams. I'll pick two just as an examples. We have a membership team and we have a storytelling team. And though you probably recognize or are obviously familiar with those terms, those aren't historically startup orgs, or startup disciplines and teams. And let me tell you about the intention behind both.

(00:46:16):
Membership. Membership was, when I was at Facebook, the most impressive thing to me about how Facebook built product was their user research team. Shout out to Lowie and Jane. I don't know why you'd be listening to this podcast, but you deeply inspired me when we were at Facebook together. They had the most incredible team of user researchers. And it always felt odd to me. And this isn't Lowie and Jane's fault. Actually, in fact, they suffered from this. That user research almost felt like a service organization, relative to product engineering design. There'd be a PM. The PM would get assigned a researcher and the PM got to decide how to use the researcher, and ask them what to do and ask them questions. But seeing the potential for when you really get to know the people that you are building for, that you're serving, at a really deep way, it is extraordinary. How do you build product any other way?

(00:47:09):
And so, we took that to the extreme at The Browser Company, which we said, "Let's not think of it as customer support, customer service, customer success, user research. Those are just business terms. Those are just industry terms." At the end of the day, what we're saying is if there is a human being, from the moment they touch our software or our products for the first time, to, if they have it last, we need to have a deep, genuine, ongoing relationship with them.

(00:47:36):
And on day one, that may be air quote, "customer success." "How do I use this thing?" On day 37, that might be, "I have a bug. Do you mind helping me fix it?" And on day 58, that may be, "Hey, we're shipping the mobile app soon. What do you want from mobile? What do you want on your phone?" Other companies view that as different orgs and disciplines. We view that as, there are a bunch of people at the other end of this that we are serving from the moment they touch our product the first time. Let's own that relationship full stack and think about it holistically. And so that's the membership team.

(00:48:07):
On the storytelling side, very similar, different type of person. Again, we're a humanistic the company. So, the theme here is the people on the company, the people at the other end. So if the membership team takes people from the moment they touch our product for the first time to the last, the storytelling team is about people we don't have the privilege of serving yet. They don't use Arc, they don't know what Arc is. That could be an investor, air quote, "investor relations." That could be members of the press, air quote, "PR." That could be just people out in the world, air quote, "marketing" and one-day sales. But at the end of the day, it's telling our story to people. It's telling our story to people and thinking about that holistically in full stack.

(00:48:47):
So that's how we think about teams is, we start with first principles asking, what are we really trying to do here? And what is the most direct way to manifest that, even if it's not how other people do it? In practice, one of the benefits of that is I do think it leads to certain pieces of content. For example, that people go, "Oh, wow! I've never seen that before." But again, I think anyone's capable of this. I think we have an extraordinarily talented storytelling team and membership team, but I really think it's as simple as the intentionality of what is the team? What are their incentives? What are the disciplines on the team? Even hiring a video editor, for example, as a small company. But the video editor, not having make a TikTok account go viral. But think about it more holistically in terms of the people.

(00:49:33):
So, again, there's a lot that breaks down. There's a lot that's not going well about it. I have no idea how the scales, the 500 people ... Yeah. So this is not me saying this experiment is ultimately going to be a huge success, or right for everyone or even us at different times. But that was the intentionality of the membership team, the storytelling team and others. And even product management. We don't have PMs at the company. My title at Facebook was Product Manager. I love product management. But, we view it not as a team. We view it as a leader, a role on a project, on an effort.

(00:50:07):
And depending on the projects, different types of people should be a PM. So, we have a performance-related project going on where, of course, an infrastructure engineer should be that air quote, "PM." We have a product project, where actually I think someone from membership should be the PM, because ultimately, yes, we're building software product, but it is really about serving our members in a specific way, so we should have someone for membership be a PM. Again, as you can imagine, as is going through the heads of everyone listening, "That must break down in 18 ways?" Oh, it definitely does. And so I'm not promising one day it won't change. But again, continuous through the company is, assume you don't know. Start by asking what could be, and let's just try some things and see what happens.

Lenny (00:50:48):
Start with what could be. I love that value. This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, this sheet tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you, instead of working for you? Why does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process, from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear's designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about Linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large, established companies such as Versel Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using Linear as magical visit linear.app/lenny to try Linear for free with your team and get 25% off when you upgrade. That's linear.app/lenny.

(00:52:00):
So, I was going to ask you actually, you talked about why you don't have PMs. Do you think you'll hire PMs in the future, having a PM background? Do you think you'll get there or do you think you'll try to stick to this? People do the PM role, depending on the project?

Josh Miller (00:52:12):
Yeah. We've increasingly hiring people that at other companies may have a PM title. I'd say we have two to three right now, that could have a PM title at another company. I don't think we will have a pm organization, or a PM role, because again, we believe depending on ... If you unpack the verbs that a PM does, I think those are verbs that anyone that we hire could do. And it really depends on what is the project? And what are we trying to do? I think the thing that will be unwavering is we like to hire mutts. And I haven't yet figured out a term that comes off as more endearing, because it's meant to be very endearing, but ... For example, there's a woman in a company named Rebecca.

(00:52:58):
Rebecca was a data scientist we use at Cora. She got her PhD in MIT in I think behavioral psychology or something. I'm probably going to misquote that. But, got some crazy degree at MIT, and then was a software engineer at Stripe. And I'm talking about Rebecca through her resume. There's so much about Rebecca. She plays effectively a PM role right now. She is effectively PMing our effectively our multi-player team. But what was so awesome about meeting Rebecca is her and other people at this company have the mindset of, "I make things, and I will do what I need to do to make what I want to make. Whenever that verb is, whenever that discipline is." And that requires people that are multidisciplinary in practice and multidisciplinary in approach to their work. It's not that we don't hire PMs, but we want to hire people who have a multidisciplinary approach and view things as, "I like to make things. Tell me how I contribute to making it." And sometimes they may play the verbs of a PM and sometimes it may be something else.

Lenny (00:54:07):
This can be a really interesting story to follow. I've seen this journey a few times at different companies. What I find is a lot of times people that are good at other things like engineering or design, for a while, they're like, "Yep. We don't need PMs. I'll do the PM job." And then eventually they're like, "This sucks. I hate doing this stuff. I want to design. Leave me alone. I don't want to sit on a [inaudible 00:54:29] all day. I don't want to be in meetings." So eventually, it turns out, they're like, "Okay. Let's find someone to do this thing that loves it." And so that's one thing that happens.

(00:54:36):
The other thing I find is, I'm sure you've seen this, a lot of people are wary of PMs. They come in and they're like, "Here's what we're doing," and they're just adults process complexity. What I find is those are just bad PMs. If you have an awesome PM, everything just gets better. Everyone's happier, things move faster. So I think companies often get to that stage. And then also there's just career development stuff, eventually as you scale. It's like "What happened to my career path," and they're like, "All right. Well, we got to go on one road or another." It's hard to stay in this hybrid role. But I super respect the first principal's approach of let's just-

Josh Miller (00:55:08):
And, for what's worth, Lenny. I think you're almost, definitely right. And I think it will almost definitely happen with us. And again, this goes back to the "assume you don't know." The "assume you don't know," is try a prototype and then assume it's not going to work. So, even in my own experience, I remember getting to know Evan from Snapchat just enough to know how he talked about PMs at Snap. And it was, "We're never going to hire PMs at Snap. Everyone's a designer." And, I have no relationship with him anymore, but you can look, there are a lot of PMs at Snapchat.

(00:55:37):
So I know from my own experience with people that I respect from a product perspective that were indignant, they would never hire PMs, their organizations now have PMs. And that's probably for a really good reason. I would tell say also on our team, if any of our designers are listening, they'll tell you these, whatever you want to call it, "These verbs are taking up a lot of my time, and I do not have as much time to think and dream and design and do user research." And so, we're already feeling it breaking into our company.

(00:56:04):
I think the intentionality, whatever comes next, whatever it is, is leaders of the project should be picked for the projects, not because they're in a certain org at our company. And, if we ever hire people to do the PM role, we want them to think of themselves as people who make things and have lots of different disciplines and tools in their toolkit, not just the PM discipline. And, of course, even that could be wrong, and maybe in a year we cave. I got it totally wrong. We got it totally wrong. So, we'll see. But I would also, that that of all the things I shared on this podcast so far, this is probably the one I'll come crawling back to your podcast in a couple years, being, "Lenny, you were right. It all blew up!"

Lenny (00:56:47):
But it's a fun experiment and Snap is a good example. Stripes another, where they waited a long time to hire their first PMs. And I think it's because their designers or engineers were just incredibly good at that element. And it was also very design-forward or very edge-forward, so they didn't need as much PM skill initially.

Josh Miller (00:57:03):
If I had to predict, I would predict that if we found that we were missing this discipline as a team, I think we would evolve Rebecca's team, which is technically the data team, and do something closer to a technical PM or data plus [inaudible 00:57:19] Again, it's all live, but the thought has even crossed our minds recently, that we may be wrong, and what org might we create if we need folks that have more of a background of [inaudible 00:57:29] like this.

Lenny (00:57:30):
I'm excited for the video of this discussion that might happen. It's also interesting, your PM that you mentioned, Rebecca is very data oriented. And then, the initial discussion we had around focus on feelings and that sort of thing. So, that's cool that you have this really interesting balance of people that are very data focused and then this, "Okay. But let's not obsess with that. What are the feelings we're trying to create?"

Josh Miller (00:57:50):
Yeah. Because again, the point of optimizing for feelings is not hire people who make feelings. It's like Rebecca's title is Data Lead. She runs our data team. But, Rebecca's one of the most humanistic people I know. You meet her and you feel the warmth that you feel when you talk to you, and you ask her what she does outside of work. And so, it's not that data doesn't have a role. Actually I'd say, for better or worse, data is part of our practice. It's more about what's that top-level intentionality? What are we trying to do here? But, yeah. We have a lot of people that, data is either a noun they've had in their resume or it's been a part of their practice a lot in the past.

Lenny (00:58:29):
Awesome. One very tactical question with the storytelling team makes me think about Airbnb's video team. A lot of people are joking internally for years and years that the videos Airbnb put out in the early days accounts for half their market cap, because they're so good. And you're just like, "Oh, my God, I want to go on an Airbnb." They just make you feel so much and they're soul made. So, what is the makeup of your storytelling team? Because I imagine some companies maybe listening, like maybe we should do something like this on our team.

Josh Miller (00:58:57):
We have a three-person storytelling team. It's run by a woman named Nash. There is a gentleman named Ellis, who is a ... Background, started as a reporter at The Verge. Maybe there was a publication before that. But I met him when he was a reporter at The Verge covering social media. And then he ran marketing strategy for Snapchat for seven years. And then we have a person named Josh Lee, who I actually met as an intern. He was an intern at Facebook as a designer, that an intern for me at the White House when I worked at the White House, and then decided that he was over product design and over design, and totally just jumped and be like, "I'm going to be a filmmaker," and has been making really fascinating indie films for a few years now. And he's our video editor on the team.

(00:59:44):
And it's so interesting. Nash's background, she had a brief stint at NBC. But again, you get to know her and she writes poems after hours and her dream is to write a fictional book. I mean, anyone that knows Nash, especially [inaudible 01:00:00] is just a force. A force. And the three of them, what's so interesting about them, which also relates to our design team ... One of the things I also found at Facebook is there was a tendency toward homogeneity. As you know, there's a stereotype of a Facebook PM for example, or a Google PM, the contrast between them and the way they work. And one of the things we also have purposely done on the storytelling team and otherwise, let's hire radically different archetypes. Ellis cannot be more different than Nash. Nash cannot be more different than Josh. There's some shared values, there's some shared beliefs, but they're very different.

(01:00:35):
Ditto on the design team. Our design team? They are all over the place in terms of who they are, what they've done, their sensibilities, their aspirations. And whether it's the storytelling team or the design team, that can be hard sometimes, just to be honest. It's a lot easier to say, "Hey, we're the Acme Co storytelling team, we're Acme Co design team. We hire designers like this and storytellers that." We hire people all over the place. We have an extremely diverse team, but in all senses of the word. But again, the no PM thing, it's not without flaws. I can see why a lot of large companies over time tend are like, "It's the Facebook way or no way," or "You're not good for here."

Lenny (01:01:14):
Yeah. It's actually I think, exact makeup of Airbnb video team. I forget what they were called. They didn't have a cool name, the storytelling team I think. But it was a videographer, an editor and then their producer, basically.

Josh Miller (01:01:26):
Yeah. I mean, I remember going to Airbnb's offices early in my career and seeing the storyboards lining the walls and just being like, "I want to work here." So, I'm actually not familiar with the ... I mean, I'm familiar with Airbnb's videos and brand marketing, fucking fantastic, excuse my language. But, yeah. I remember just walking around that office being like, "Oh, my goodness! Are they making a movie or something? I want to [inaudible 01:01:53] here."

Lenny (01:01:54):
Funny you say that. And for folks that want to find that, we'll link to it in show notes. But if you Google "Snow White Airbnb," you'll actually see these storyboards. They basically hired a Pixar storyboard artist to draw out key frames of the journey of a host and a guest. And that became a central element of the strategy of, let's make each of these moments as amazing as possible. And it was based on the movie Snow White. You can read about it.

Josh Miller (01:02:15):
For what it's worth, this is a great moment to share. All of the beliefs that I've shared here on behalf of our team, these aren't things that we just originally came up with. They're moments like when I went to Airbnb's office early in my career and saw these Snow White storyboards lining the walls. That had an impact on me. Even the idea that you would think in terms of that moment, you could actually see the lineage to, well, how do you want that person to feel when they open that door for the first time? So, I think it's just a great moment to shout out that we've accumulated a lot of doses of inspiration, like that day at Airbnb, that trickle down to us talking about optimizing for feelings. But that didn't come in a vacuum. That's our expression of what we've seen in the industry. This is building on the backs of so many people and companies that we've been fortunate to see.

Lenny (01:03:03):
And now the trickling is happening from your lessons and experience and your unique approach.

Josh Miller (01:03:07):
I hope. There's a documentary that I highly recommend called General Magic. And it's one of the best pieces of media I've seen related to technology industry. And it's really interesting. I think there are two types of people to just be very ... There are people that watch that and view it as, "Wow! What a missed opportunity," or almost like a sad story. And I view it as, "If only we could be so lucky to assemble a group of people like that." And the thing about that documentary, for anyone that hasn't listened to it is, essentially was the iPhone before the iPhone, with the most legendary group of technologists working there. And it totally failed, completely failed by all traditional business definitions.

(01:03:50):
But, what stuck with me from the documentary, how proud and nostalgic and passionate those individuals were in reminiscing about their time there. And then, what they all went on to create. And the fact that even today on this podcast, I'm sitting here talking about General Magic. So, I mean, to your point of hopefully Browser Company will have ripple effects. That to me is the ultimate goal, for me personally, at a very emotional level. If we could only be so lucky. That, to me, seems like success in many ways.

Lenny (01:04:24):
Yeah. What's cool is you're getting a lot of footage that will be very useful for a future documentary on the history of The Browser Company.

Josh Miller (01:04:30):
[inaudible 01:04:30] I didn't think about it like that, for better or worse.

Lenny (01:04:32):
One last thought, I was going to mention it in terms of the storytelling movie-making elements of Airbnb. Fun fact, there was a period where product managers were actually called producers, because one of the founders was like, "We don't want to manage product, we want to produce beautiful experiences," like a movie producer. And so that was a year and a half maybe of Airbnb's history, where product managers were producers. The problem is, we got a lot of job applicants from Emmy-winning producers and they're like, "oh, I want to work at Airbnb."

Josh Miller (01:05:01):
I know this podcast is about very tactical advice. So, one tactical piece of advice I'll give is, whether or not you like the idea of the storytelling team or something else, a byproduct of some of these experiments that we've found works really well is when you give something a new name, it sheds a lot of preconceived notions of what the thing should be. We found that even with product. So if you say you're building a browser history feature, then the benefit is everyone knows what you're talking about. And the downside is, everyone knows what you're talking about. And you show up with these preconceived notions of what it has to be. And so, if you go back again to revalue ask what could be ... In many ways the point of calling the team, the storytelling team or the membership team, or not having PMs as an organization ... All of this stuff isn't meant to be novelty for novelty's sake. It's meant to almost be a rhetorical tactic, to make people think truly first principles about what are we trying to do here?

(01:06:00):
And again, if at the end, producers are called PMs, that's fine. But I assume when it was called a producer, a much more intentionality was given to you communicating and talking and discussing, what does a producer do? What's their relationship with design? Because no one knew what the heck a producer was. And so, ultimately, that may have been failure in other ways. But that's one of the things we found tactically to be really helpful is, whether it's a product feature or a team, or whatever, give it a made up name just to really get to the root of what you're trying to do there. Or not borrow too much from wherever you worked before, whatever you've seen, popular media or whatever.

Lenny (01:06:36):
I love that. And it's very undo ... Like, you've got to undo it. It was-

Josh Miller (01:06:41):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:06:42):
It's a two-way door. And I like just the vision, the value you have of just prototyping things and whatever. It didn't work. Let's go back to what everyone else is doing. You mentioned great product and there was something I definitely wanted to chat a bit about, which is just, there's this group of companies who are just focused on, "Let's just build the most amazing product experience." And I feel like The Browser Company is at the forefront in a lot of this. But it's like you guys, Linear, Raycast is this product, Cron. There's probably a few more and I'd love to actually hear if there's others that I'm not thinking about. That are just obsessed with the user experience and less focused on drive metrics, drive revenue.

(01:07:24):
And I'm curious, just where do you think this goes? What's your take on this trend? Why isn't every company thinking this way? Or is this just like, "We don't know if this is a good idea in the end?" So what's your take on this cohort of just like, "We're just going to build the best possible product and hope it all works out,"?

Josh Miller (01:07:41):
Yeah. Well, I'll say first, I love those products, or many of those products you mentioned. There's some I haven't really used. But, for example, our company runs on Linear, and has run on Linear since day one. So, I'm a big fan of that. So, the way that we think about it is ... So, I actually spent two years at a venture capital firm as an investor, called Thrive Capital. They've invested in Slack and GitHub and a lot of really transformative companies. But I was an investor there. I was a venture capitalist. It even feels weird to say that. And I learned a lot. A lot. A lot. A lot from that experience. It has made me, I think, a better CEO and a better product leader. And one of the things I learned is different ideas, product ideas, business ideas, company ideas come with different attributes and things that will matter to their success.

(01:08:34):
And so, when thinking about starting The Browser Company and picking this category of software, Hursch and I were incredibly intentional about what that would mean for what would need to matter for our company. And so, if you think about the web browser category, traditionally ... I'm not saying forward facing, I'm not saying it is what we are doing. But, if you were to look backwards and take The Browser Company out of it, and look at the web browser category, you'd notice a few things. The first is, it's actually one of the most consumer pieces of software out there. People forget that. That's the opportunity to us. If you ask someone in the street, "What's your web browser? What do you think?" They either won't know or they won't care, "[inaudible 01:09:15]. I don't know."

(01:09:16):
But what pieces of software do your parents, do your little nieces and nephews and you use? What's at the center of that Venn diagram? Your parents hopefully don't use TikTok and Instagram, or probably don't. Your nieces and nephews, I hope don't have a reason for email at the tender age of 16, or a calendar. And a web browser's one of the few things in the middle. So it's an incredibly universal piece of software consumer, unlike very few other things outside of a smartphone and messaging, and maybe video calling in 2023 and a web browser. So, it's very consumer, very universal.

(01:09:52):
The second attribute is, it's a commodity. I'm not saying that Arc is a commodity or we want it to be, but objectively web browsers are interchangeable. They all do the same thing. Increasingly, they're literally just carbon copies of the exact same code chromium, with little tweaks, little tweaks around the edges. So, they're all the same. It's a commodity market. And they're unbelievably lucrative. Browsers print cash. There is a reason why they're owned primarily by Google, Apple and Microsoft. They're incredibly high margin, they're incredibly lucrative. Low marginal costs. The cost of revenue is incredibly low, et cetera, et cetera.

(01:10:30):
So we have a product that everyone in the world uses, where they're all identical, essentially, interchangeable commodities. And if you can get people to use it, you're going to print money. So, the attributes of that business and that product category mean, you have to win on how much do people love your product and feel an emotional connection to it, and choose your brand, your product over the other, almost not rationally, but emotionally. And so, if you tie that back to everything I've said before, bingo! That is what we want to work on. That's what we want. We want to create emotional connection with people. We're creating that emotional connection with as many people as possible and delighting them with surprises and animations, is the way you win. It's not romantic, it is practical. In many ways it's capitalistic. This is how we win this market if you want to think about it that way.

(01:11:30):
So, the reason I hesitate to answer your question directly is, I don't think that applies to every category of software. And to be totally honest, I don't know enough about the ticketing space or the calendaring space or the whatever other space to know, honestly, off the cuff, if that approach is good for those industries. As a human being, at the other end, I'm really grateful that they picked some reason to do it, whether or not it is part of their business strategy or not. It's a really wonderful trend as a human at the other end that cares about feelings. But I would say, we actually think about it not as a, "We're focusing on the user experience over revenue or growth." We, in fact, picked a category of software we're focusing on brand and user experience is how you get growth and revenue.

(01:12:14):
And, because we knew that this is who we are, and if we were building cybersecurity software that you sell to government agencies, they are not going to give a shit about rounded edges, or what color the button is, or how surprised you feel with every member update. So, we didn't build cybersecurity software to sell to the government. So, I hope that more people build things at the craft bar of something like Linear, but that's how we think about it, is less of a "this versus that," and more "could we pick something we're going to work on, where that's how you win."

Lenny (01:12:48):
I think that's a really powerful insight, that for consumer software especially, and for commoditized consumer software especially, experience is a differentiator. You need to give people a reason to even try it, and then end up sticking with it when there's awesome alternatives. And so, just an obsession with the experience is a really smart strategy. If you get that right, people use it and continue to use it and you win.

Josh Miller (01:13:13):
I've seen this with a lot of ... And COVID is, I'm sure everyone listening, has a lot of the remote-work collaboration tools. A lot of them obsess, to their credit, over really interesting design details and product feature concepts that were imaginative and brought people together in new ways. And then the latency of the video of the audio audio was horrible, because they relied on some third-party API that was significantly worse than Zoom. And so, that's a great example where in that market, that category software, you better nail latency. I think a great example of this ... One of my favorite products these days, but past years is Tuple. It's ostensibly a paired programming tool that just lives in your menu bar. I'm not paired program with anyone. It is the fastest way to talk to someone at your company. And they have an unbelievably simple user experience.

(01:14:00):
The designer, based in Lyon, France, is incredible. It's a beautifully designed product. And it is the best audio quality I have ever experienced in a communication tool. Better than Zoom. So, that exact same product with all their craft details, sand latency, not going to do it. But also Tuple wouldn't have beat a lot of the other competitors for me if it wasn't unbelievably beautiful and easy and simple to use as well. So again, I think it's like, what are the attributes you need to win and picking a market that the ones that you want to excel at and work on, are key to that.

Lenny (01:14:34):
And also how much better you need to be. Like, if there's a 20% better than Chrome product, people are just going, "That's fine. I don't need to learn something new and everyone's using something else. I'm just going to have all these problems." So, you got to be significantly better. And that's a high bar for consumer products. Final question I wanted to touch on. You talked about the big vision for Arc and The Browser Company. And you mentioned this idea of the internet computer. And this is another question Scott Belsky suggested. By the way, Scott is the CPO of Adobe and just an awesome product-thinker person. And he just wanted to make sure that we touch on this, because I think there's a big idea here that maybe people don't realize. So, if you could just give us a brief overview of, what is just the actual vision and plan for The Browser Company and Arc, long term as a final question?

Josh Miller (01:15:19):
Yeah. So, we call it The Browser Company of New York almost as a misdirection, because as you know from the intro, we view Arc as a replacement for your default web browser, but we're hoping it will be much more. And so, to start at the highest level and bring it down to reality, one of the things that I've done many times in my career already is underestimate pretty foundational changes in how we use technology. I've appreciated them but underestimated them. Great example is mobile. I think me and Hursh's first company would've been much more successful if we really appreciated the tidal wave that was mobile. And I think one of those macro trends we're underestimating right now is the shift to cloud computing. The shift to the internet, which may sound weird because every big public company mentions Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. You hear about cloud, cloud, cloud and cloud. But again, that's this business term.

(01:16:13):
What I mean by the shift to cloud computing is, everything in our technology, in our computing lives is moving to the internet. It has been moving, but it's going to move even more. And what I mean by that is, your applications are almost all today web-based, internet-based applications. And they will all be soon. There's very, very few pieces of truly local-only software or even local-first software left. All of our files are moving to the internet, if they're not all already there. So if you really think about your files today, and again you ignore the word "files," the stuff you need for work in your personal life. They're not sitting on your desktop, they're all URLs. It may be an air quote "PDF," but that PDF is probably out on Dropbox somewhere and you're accessing it as a URL.

(01:17:03):
Your photos may seem like they're on your iPhone. They're not on your iPhone, they're on some iCloud server somewhere. When you get a new iPhone, they'll be right there. The manifestation of that actually is, if you smash your device that you're listening to this on right now, whether it's a phone or computer, other than being sad that you lost the resale value and there's a chore of replacing it and a cost of replacing it, you would not lose any of your stuff. So, imagine in five years our entire computing lives are not on our devices, on our computers, on our phones. They're out there somewhere. They're out in the internet, they're out in the cloud, which begs the question ... I remember when I was 10 and I got my first computer. It was a see-through iMac. And I wonder ... My son is two. When he's 10, what will his computer be?

(01:17:52):
And I mean computer not in the technical ... Again, going back to words and the words that we use. I don't mean computer in the literal sense of my MacBook Air, but computer in the human sense of, what you need from your computer, your stuff, your applications and tools that people ... Where is that going to be? Where is his computer going to be? I think it's obvious at this point that we're going to have airflow computers everywhere. We already do. My car has CarPlay, my TV is a computer, my laptop is a computer. I think that's going to be even more true in five years, where hardware is commoditizing. And it will commoditize even more. They're becoming empty shells that don't have anything on it. They're just vessels. They're just interfaces to viewing our real computer, which is out there on the internet somewhere. And so, our view is that what we are building at The Browser Company is an internet computer, is a air quote "computer," where the move to the internet and move to the cloud accelerates and continues the tsunami as much as we think it will.

(01:18:57):
And the way we represent that is, we say we want to be to the web browser, what the iPhone was to the cell phone. Yes. The iPhone replaced your cell phone, but it really was something much more. And so, we want Arc to be the iPhone for the internet, and that yes, it replaces your default browser. But whether or not we call it the internet computer or something else, it really is that interface, this new type of computer. If you play that one step forward, then what we're building today is, we're building our equivalent of multi-touch gestures and the first party-notes app. But, on any new computer, any computer or computing device, the developer platform itself is much more interesting and lucrative and world changing than the first-party computer itself. And so, we have no doubt that in the next decade, if we're successful, if we still exist, Arc as a development platform is going to be much more central to what we're doing, building on top of these internet computers, ours and others than anything else.

(01:20:00):
So to bring that down from reality. If you think about it, the internet, the web, is really the best development platform out there in many ways. It is accessible on every single device. It doesn't matter who makes it or the shape and size. It is free to access for individuals. You don't need money to access it. It's free for developers. You don't have to pay a license to use it. There's no 30% tax on what you make. And it's democratic. The best frameworks can win. And so, in many ways, if you were to say, "Hey, in this future we want to see, what is the platform that we should be developing on top of, what has the best attributes?" The web has that. And that's why you're seeing today. Why do you think Figma is in the web browser?

(01:20:41):
Why do you think Figma's blog post was "Meet us in the Web Browser"? Because as the development platform, developers cross platform in one click. There's no tax. Everyone should want to and wants to make for the web. The challenge, though, is there's an experience gap. Native software feels better for whatever reason. And the problem is the people that control our interfaces to this development platform that is the web, that is the internet, have incentives to keep it from being as good as local software, from truly native, immersive software. Apple? They don't want you making web apps or applications for the web. They want you making them for the Mac and the iPhone so they can taxi you when you do it through the app store. And also surprisingly, Google doesn't want you making stuff, more native and immersive for the air quote "Web," because they want it to be indexed by their search engine.

(01:21:37):
So, there's a reason that the Chrome extension platform is one of the most underutilized opportunities. They view it as a loss leader. They built chrome extensions just so they could have parity with Firefox. They don't want you making extensions, because you have some immersive extension experience that's not something that you could index in Google. And that's taking away from doing searches. And so, I think we look at this and say, everything is heading to the internet, which means we need interfaces to the internet that are truly more robust than a browser, that are more of a computer. And if we do that, then the most interesting opportunity on top of that is actually the things other people were built on top of this development platform. And if you look at this development platform, which exists today, the worldwide web, the open internet, what is missing is an interface and a set of capabilities and APIs to make web-based experiences as immersive and rich and powerful as native experiences, which require that interface to the internet to provide those.

(01:22:34):
And our interfacers to the internet today are the web browser companies. They have perverse business model incentives as big public companies that have lost the soul of the founders, that they don't want to do that. They don't want to do that. So it doesn't mean we're going to do it. And in fact one of them may win. And I actually think that this is something [inaudible 01:22:51]. We're trying to sell anyone in our vision. We feel fully confident there are going to be many types of internet computers and Arc may or may not be one of them. But we feel very confident that that is the future and the development platform on top of the web and the internet, and these new interfaces will be the most exciting opportunity.

Lenny (01:23:09):
My next question was going to be how do you make money with a browser, which people get for free, really well? And now it makes a lot more sense where y'all are going. And so, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Josh Miller (01:23:26):
Ready.

Lenny (01:23:27):
Okay. So, ready? What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Josh Miller (01:23:34):
Harold and the Purple Crayon, Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, which is a book about Robert Irwin. That's my number one PM book. So, if you're asking from the perspective of the disciplines of people listening, that book is absolutely fantastic. And then God Saved Texas by Lawrence Wright, who's one of my favorite authors, who if you're interested in road trips, politics, food, culture. So, three very different types of books.

Lenny (01:23:58):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Josh Miller (01:24:01):
The first TV show episode I've cried from in recent memories, episode three of The Last of Us. I thought I was watching a zombie violence thing and I just was sitting there bawling. So that one. And then I've been re-watching all of the Adam Curtis documentaries on YouTube. I'm a huge Adam Curtis fan.

Lenny (01:24:20):
I have not heard of Adam Curtis. I will have to go check that out.

Josh Miller (01:24:23):
Hyper-normalization is my favorite. And I would view his work as less non-fictional documentaries and more video art.

Lenny (01:24:32):
There's been a meme of everyone saying White Lotus is the show to watch. And I feel like it's about to transition to Last of Us. And so we will see how that goes.

Josh Miller (01:24:40):
Can I get it first? Was I the first guest to say it?

Lenny (01:24:43):
I think you might be actually. I forget, but I think you might be.

Josh Miller (01:24:45):
All right. Well, I'll say episode three, specifically.

Lenny (01:24:47):
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. People love that one. But every episode's awesome. Next question. Favorite interview question you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?

Josh Miller (01:24:56):
What would you like to ask me? That seems like a non-answer, but my interviews at Browser Company are all, "Ask me anything," and I find what people ask, and how they follow up, is as revealing about who they are and what they care about than anything I could ask them.

Lenny (01:25:12):
What is it that you look for in an answer that tells you, okay, this is a good candidate?

Josh Miller (01:25:17):
Authenticity, probably more than anything else. Do they really believe what they're saying?

Lenny (01:25:21):
Awesome. What are some SASS products that your company uses and loves, other than ... ? I don't know if you consider our SASS, but probably not. So, yeah.

Josh Miller (01:25:29):
I want to plug Tuple. I think I'm going to put everything on Tuple, relative to ... We run on Notion, we love Notion, we love Linear. But I'd say the closet hit that I just cannot believe is not a hundred times larger company is Tuple. It is ostensibly a pair programming tool, but don't go in with that mindset. Go in with, "I need to talk to a colleague right now," or "a couple of colleagues right now, to do some work together," and it is absolutely fantastic.

Lenny (01:25:58):
I love it. I love these products I've never heard of that are super cool. We will link to that. Next question. What's something relatively minor you've changed in how you build product, that has had a significant impact in your team's ability to ship and execute?

Josh Miller (01:26:11):
This past January, a couple months ago, we have started removing me from a lot of the product development process, which seems to be really healthy. So, that has been the big shift this year.

Lenny (01:26:22):
That's a big transition. I went through that at Airbnb and it's great. It's great for everyone. Final question. Best pro-tip for using Arc, that people may not be aware of?

Josh Miller (01:26:32):
Try your best to not think of it as a browser. And have a beginner's mind about how it works and how you might use the internet.

Lenny (01:26:40):
Whoa! Big idea.

Josh Miller (01:26:42):
Yeah. Big takeaway from this conversation, we got to get much better at describing what the heck we built. And why it's good for you. So, I'm not proud of my first or last answer, but it is what it is.

Lenny (01:26:54):
And, actually, I mentioned this in the intro and if you listen to this already, you probably heard it already, but we're going to link ... In the show notes, we'll have a link to actually get into Arc, because right now it's wait-listed and we have this link that will get you straight into Arc. And so go check it out. Josh, you've shown up with heartfelt intensity. I feel like I want to go apply for a job at The Browser Company now. But you're not hiring product managers, so I'm not going to do that. Just kidding. Thank you so much for being here, for being so genuine and insightful and warm. And thank you.

Josh Miller (01:27:29):
Thank you so much, Lenny. I really enjoyed this.

# The UX Research reckoning is here | Judd Antin (Airbnb, Meta)

## Transcript

Judd Antin (00:00:00):
User-centered performance refers to customer obsession or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. It's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. If your listeners are like, "I don't do that." I'm like, "Think about it for a second. This is extremely common." Every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, "Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions," that's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. One of my big mantras was, "We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong." Many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate, and that's user-centered performance.

Lenny (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Judd Anton. Judd helped build the user research practice at Facebook. He was a longtime head of research at Airbnb, and his direct reports have gone on to lead research teams at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, Fair, and other amazing companies. These days, Judd spends his time consulting, helping companies with organizational challenges, product strategy, design, research, hiring, onboarding, and crisis management. In our conversation, we unpack a conclusion that Jud has come to recently about how the user research field is going through a reckoning and what needs to change both within the user research field and how companies leverage user research going forward. 

(00:01:37):
Judd shares what the user research field has gotten wrong over the last decade, how PMs and designers rely on user research too often, and to answer the wrong questions, where user research will continue to provide significant value, and how to best leverage your researchers, why it's important for researchers to think about the business goals more versus just what the users need, what to look for when you're hiring a user researcher, how PMs can be better partners to researchers, and also a phenomenon that I love that Judd describes and often witnesses, that he calls user-centered performance, where everyone acts like they care about the user, but they're just doing it for show and already know what they want to do. This episode has a lot of spicy takes and will probably upset some people, but Judd is sharing some real talk, here, that I think we all need to hear. With that, I bring you Judd Antin after a short word from our sponsors. 

(00:02:27):

Judd Antin (00:04:22):
Lenny, thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:24):
It's my pleasure. So we actually worked together at Airbnb for many years. And as I was preparing for this, I realized how many of the people that you managed went on to do amazing things. So I'm just going to read a list of people that worked for you and what they do now. We had Matt Gallivan, who now leads research at Slack. We have Janna Bray, who leads research at Notion, Celeste Ridlen, who leads research at Robinhood. Rebecca Grey, who leads research at Fair, Hannah Pileggi, who I think was leading research at Duolingo, Louise Beryl, who leads research at Figma, and then Noam, who was leading research at Wealthfront. I think he moved on to something else. What a fricking crazy alumni community and group from this one team that you hired and incubated.

Judd Antin (00:05:11):
No, I've never looked at that list, but I'll tell you, I have been so privileged to work with all these amazing humans. I can't take credit for it. They're just outstanding people. And I'm glad the diaspora is out there, because these people, rock stars.

Lenny (00:05:23):
Okay. The main reason that I wanted to do a podcast episode with you is that you wrote this piece that was titled The User Research Reckoning is Here, which I understand caused quite a stir in the research community and I think adjacent communities. And let me just read one of your takeaways at the top of your post to give people a sense of what it was about. You wrote, "The user research discipline over the last 15 years is dying. The reckoning is here. The discipline can still survive and thrive, but we'd better adapt, and quick." Before we get into the meat of the piece, could you share a bit about just the reaction to this piece and maybe if it was a surprise and what you expected would happen when you put this out?

Judd Antin (00:06:06):
Yeah, I was definitely surprised. I wrote it because I wanted to start a conversation about something I was thinking about. I didn't really know who would read it. And in the end it turned out a lot of people read it. I learned that using the word reckoning may have been a mistake because it inspires a lot of drama in a conversation that I wanted to be really productive and positive. Overall, I would say, though, that the response was very positive. It seemed to resonate with a lot of people who reached out to me. I spent a lot of time talking to teams, to designers, to researchers, but there were also a ton of critiques. 

(00:06:43):
I would say some of it was like people thought I was throwing research or researchers under the bus, like, "It's researchers' fault. We're doing it wrong." Which I don't believe at all. And that I wasn't taking responsibility as a research leader or a design leader myself. And the most interesting one I would say was the anti-capitalist crew, because one of my points that we'll talk about is that I think researchers need to be more profit focused. And there are a lot of people out there who, I think they think that's not cool or not research's job, and I'm like, "Well, what are we doing then, if we're not helping businesses succeed?" But that was the most surprising critique, for sure.

Lenny (00:07:23):
I've worked with some of those people who are just like, "Why are we growing? Why do we focus so much on growth? Why do we need to grow this business?"

Judd Antin (00:07:29):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:07:29):
So I get that. 

Judd Antin (00:07:30):
Maybe it's the wrong industry for them.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Yeah. I'm not a fan of that. Okay. Let's actually dig into the meat of your message, and the big takeaway, and the conclusion of what you're finding is happening in user research. And I know a lot of this comes from a lot of user researchers have been laid off at a lot of companies. It was one of the hardest hit teams. And so I think a lot of this comes from that. So yeah, so let's just start big and then see where it goes.

Judd Antin (00:07:53):
So yeah, everybody who's paying attention has noticed that there have been a bunch of layoffs. And I think back in the summer I was thinking, "Listen, this seems to be hitting UX and UX research particularly hard. Is there something going on? Is there a bigger picture?" The reason I use the word reckoning is because to me that's like, "Hey, a moment to take stock." And triggered by the fact that a lot of wonderful humans may have lost their jobs, and many more are afraid of losing their jobs. And so if it's a sign, the fact that research has been hit so hard, it's a sign of what? And so the thesis of my article is really, it's a sign that maybe the system is a little more broken than we think and that research is not driving the value or impact that it should or could. And that's for a bunch of reasons, I think. Some of it is stuff that research can do better, and a lot of it is how research is integrated and positioned in companies. 

(00:08:46):
And at the root of all that, I think, is that we're just doing too much of what I would consider the wrong type of research. And what I mean by the wrong type of research is I have this framework, and it's in the article, macro, middle range, and micro research, at least three ways to talk about it. And it's pretty simple, the intuition of what those are. So macro research is big picture, strategic, business focused, forward-looking innovation, look at the market, look at competitors, long-term research to understand where the product should go next, stuff like that. 

(00:09:20):
And then you have micro research, which a lot of really technical usability falls into this, all the beautiful stuff that researchers do to enable a really high quality, excellent, pixel perfect thing to go out the door, laser-focused research to understand AB test results, stuff like that. And then you have this middle range, which is this blobular place where the research questions are middle altitude and a lot of the core, let's say user understanding questions fall here. And a lot of what research is doing is research in that space. It's, "Let's take a group of people and ask some questions about how they think, feel, behave, how they're using a product or not using a product." And it's just this devastating mix of really interesting to many, including researchers, and not impactful enough for the business. That's the core thesis. Researchers do it because it's interesting, but honestly, and a thing we should talk about, Lenny, is researchers also do it because it's the kind of work we most often get asked to do. 

Lenny (00:10:22):
Yeah. That's exactly what I was thinking. As a PM, that's what I want to get answers to, is like, "How should we think about this one product?" And I totally get this.

Judd Antin (00:10:31):
Yeah. The questions turn out to be really interesting and there are many cases at many companies where it's super impactful. But the problem with those types of questions is they tend to, they trigger all the worst stuff that researchers experience. So they yield results which are interesting, but sometimes hard to operationalize. They trigger the post hoc bias, really, really, really well where a lot of people can say confidently like, "Oh, that was obvious. We knew that already." And they fulfill this need for us to feel and be customer obsessed, user-centered, without changing anything. So doing too much of that research to me is a symptom of a broken system, and where companies are really different from each other. I heard from so many after this article and they're like, "Well, my company and my industry is like this or not like this." 

(00:11:24):
But in tech, we spent the last many years hiring, hiring, hiring researchers, but maybe, I'm sure most of your listeners are familiar with the idea of a ZIRP. Maybe it was a zero interest base phenomenon, where it was okay when the money was easy, to hire researchers, even though we were not setting them up properly. We're were going to set them up to fail. We set them up as a service function. We didn't know what research was for. We didn't know how to really drive impact with it. And that's where the reckoning comes from. It's like that era is over. Research, I think, is more crucial than ever. Good, great researchers are more impactful than ever. But it's in a new space. We're in a new space now.

Lenny (00:12:05):
I want to make sure people understand this framework. And specifically, how would you best describe the difference between this middle range research and macro research?

Judd Antin (00:12:16):
Middle range research is usually focused on a more specific set of research questions or a constituency. So if macro is like, "Let's understand the overall competitive landscape. Let's do a concept car type project where we really look ahead. Let's get involved with strategic planning," which is a wonderful thing for researchers to do, do TAM studies, other things like that, that stuff lives in the macro space. 

(00:12:42):
The middle range space is like, what's a good example? "We want to know how Airbnb hosts feel about their payment options." That's a really interesting, reasonable question. And we can go out and do research on that, but it's not that specific. It's not really targeted at a business problem yet. It could be. Maybe that's a result of the research, but it yields these middle range insights in which we've learned things like, "Well, hosts want flexibility about their payment options." I'm making this up. And that's a good example where it's like, "It's not that that's not an interesting set of questions, it's just not quite pointed enough." And it's not framed in the language of the funnel, or the business strategy, or the OKRs. It's not quite enough aligned enough to that. It's too blobular in that middle level and it ends up not driving impact.

Lenny (00:13:38):
I think it also leads to a lot of the things as you described, people don't like about research. It delays everything. You have to wait for the research to be done to have an answer, to make a clear decision. It also creates this issue that people complain about, that PMs and product teams don't want to just make a decision on their own. They're like, "I will get this additional data point and make sure research tells us this is the right answer instead of just trusting there." God, I guess maybe along those lines, this might be going off a little track, but what's your advice there for, say, product managers or PMs or product teams to not necessarily rely on research for that middle research?

Judd Antin (00:14:14):
I think the reason why so many PMs ask for those middle range questions is because they haven't really gotten deep with their researcher in a way which can leverage it for maximum impact. So if the question is like, "Hey, Judd, you just pointed out a bunch of problems, can you be more solutions oriented?" Well, the solution is simple but not easy to me. It's that we need to restructure the way we make products in a way which integrates research much more fully. It looks like consistent relationships in which researchers, and the work, and the insights they provide are a part of the process from beginning to end.

(00:14:51):
And I think, Lenny, you as a PM, that's how you worked. I remember you, I know who you worked with. You worked with great researchers. But honestly, most product processes are not that way. And so that's when research is a service function. It gets called in right at the end. It's reactive in the sense that a researcher in the room listening and participating in the conversation could have a ton of impact on framing exactly the right question that will drive maximum business impact, maximum product improvement at that moment, and then go do it quick, and get back, and we're onto the next. But they weren't there, the relationship wasn't there. They're not engaged in the project from the beginning. And that's the number one root of the problem. As long as research is a service discipline, I think we're going to be stuck in this spot.

Lenny (00:15:37):
When people might be hearing this, on the one hand, it's research has been not as helpful to teams as they thought, and researchers have been spending time on the wrong thing. On the other hand, your advice is integrate research from the beginning, make them more involved throughout. And I think that might confuse people. How should people think about, like, "Research is actually more important? You should integrate them more deeply."

Judd Antin (00:15:59):
There's a vicious cycle that's been happening, is from where I sit, and this is what I hear from many, many researchers and research leaders, which is a lot of companies hired a lot of researchers with great intentions, didn't quite know how to integrate them. And UX research is a newer discipline, so maybe that's not surprising. We're still learning how to use it. "Cool, let's evolve." But a lot of companies hired these people, but they hired them into kind of like a service discipline, very reactive, not in the room, not integrated in the way I said. 

(00:16:30):
And so they had less input on the questions to ask, or they're included, but only at the end. And then they're unable to build those direct relationships, to be there in the room to actually drive the questions and insert insights. Because a good researcher is like the repository of insights you need for growth, but they're not there. They don't participate in the decision. So they end up doing research. They have jobs to do, so they do research that is too reactive, it doesn't matter, and then it's less impactful. Executives conclude that therefore researchers are not as impactful and then they get sidelined or laid off and the cycle continues. 

(00:17:07):
So I think the short circuit is the constant engagement. If you take a great researcher and you insert them consistently in a product process, I feel confident that researcher will drive a product improvement, metrics impact, growth, all the things that you want to see as a PM and a product leader. It's just that's the exception, not the norm these days.

Lenny (00:17:31):
This may be a hard question to answer, but when people hear, "If you have a great researcher, here's how you approach it." What are signals that your researchers is great versus not great? What are some things people could look for to tell them, like, "Oh, maybe I have the wrong researcher on my team."

Judd Antin (00:17:44):
The best researchers I think are first of all, multi method. The first iteration of user research was primarily a qualitative discipline. But a strong opinion that I have is that is largely one of those models that needs to evolve. It's not that qualitative user research is no longer important. It's that the best researchers have five tools. I think they have five tools. And those five tools are number one, what we would call formative or generative user experience research. So looking ahead, innovation focused, really open-ended, maybe more ethnographic, "Let's go out into the field and talk to host and guests on Airbnb. Let's see people using our product in the field," stuff like that. So that's formative. 

(00:18:27):
The second type is evaluative, so more like usability testing. The third tool is a basic rigorous survey design. It's the best scaled way to get responses from communities small and large. You can get a lot out of really well crafted surveys. But to do that, you have to have the fourth tool, which is applied statistics, the best research, know a little bit of stats. You can't interact in a world of AB testing without knowing basic statistics. 

(00:18:56):
And then in the old version of this, the fifth tool was SQL, because I think good researchers need to be able to run their own queries. These days, so much of that is dashboarded, that the fifth tool may now be prompt engineering, which is a thing we could talk about, but I think maybe that's the fifth tool is somewhere, is it technical skills that fall in between querying your own data, understanding it very well in companies that are awash with data and then interacting with generative AI.

Lenny (00:19:24):
Amazing. That's such a cool list. Okay, so just to playback, formative, generative, innovative skills to think bigger and come up with new ideas, usability.

Judd Antin (00:19:35):
Yep.

Lenny (00:19:35):
Yeah, usability. How did you describe it? I have a different word, here. Evaluate? Evaluative?

Judd Antin (00:19:41):
Evaluative, right.

Lenny (00:19:41):
Okay.

Judd Antin (00:19:41):
So we're evaluating products and doing more. Really that's the micro level of research. 

Lenny (00:19:47):
Survey design, being really rigorous about it, applied statistics, and then SQL/dashboard/prompt engineering. 

Judd Antin (00:19:53):
Right. 

Lenny (00:19:54):
Maybe just one last question along this thread, also a big question, but any advice for how to evaluate these skills/interview for them? I know this is its own deep topic, but any advice for someone trying to find this person?

Judd Antin (00:20:05):
I've interviewed hundreds or thousands of researchers, and the way I usually approach that is you want a researcher who's got a Swiss army knife, because if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. And so if you give in the context of an interview, let's say, a researcher, a pretty juicy, open-ended research question, and you want to see how they handle it, and a good answer is usually multi-method. We're not going to handle it in any one way. We're going to say, "Well, here's a couple of ways we could deal with this. Here's how we could do this in a day, or a week, or a month." We usually don't have a month, but sometimes big research projects go on for that long. "And here are the different sets of methods that we can use." 

(00:20:44):
So see where they go. It's actually pretty simple. Most researchers are deeper in one than the other, and sometimes you can make up for those five tools with the team. So you have experts who are t-shaped, but maybe deeper in one or several of those ways. But when I built a team at Meta and at Airbnb, that was my goal, is individually as researchers build up those tools and then as a team build deep expertise that would fill all the gaps.

Lenny (00:21:10):
Coming back to the main premise of your post, one of your big takeaways is, "Researchers need to be much more business oriented, thinking about what helps the business versus the user." Which I think to a lot of researchers will feel really weird. Can you just talk about your takeaways there?

Judd Antin (00:21:25):
So much of user experience practice, not just research, but design too, is focused on empathy and very user-centered. This is beautiful. I'm not saying that we should abandon that. I think what I'm saying is there's an overlapping event, where you have the user and profit or the business. And what researchers need to do is be way more explicit about finding that overlap. So one thing, when researchers ask for advice, they're like, "Well, what should I do to be more business or profit focused?" I say something like, "Did you read the last quarterly report, If it's a public company? Did you listen to the shareholder call?" And they're probably like, "No, it's full of a bunch of language I didn't quite get." 

(00:22:12):
And I'm like, "Yep." So there you go. That's the language you need to learn. Scour your Google Drive folder, your internal folder and look for all of the documents that are about this quarter, or this halves, or next half strategy. What are the OKRs? Understand the metrics and the conversion funnel, know it back and forward, because then what you're doing is you're proposing, if you're in the active conversation, you're saying, 'Cool, I hear you asking that research question. I've identified this is exactly the spot in the funnel where I think we need to do work. There's an opportunity here. Or that competitor is eating our lunch with this group of users. I know that because I read the competitive report and I understand it deeply.'" So those are skills that some researchers have and a lot are building these days, but historically, last 15 years, it hasn't been a thing we've been as focused on, and I think that's an evolution that needs to happen.

Lenny (00:23:06):
I think a lot of PMs listening to this are going to be like, "Hallelujah." This is exactly what I've been trying to convince people of. It's what I've been trying to convince my researchers of, and design often falls into this.

Judd Antin (00:23:17):
But Lenny, the opposite is true, too, because you got to take the average PM who lives in that land, all day, every day, and what they do is not in the Venn. I think those are people who are also performing customer centricity and performing user-centeredness a lot, when they're really not interested. And so this is not about researcher. This takes two sides. Fixing this broken system takes everyone, researchers, PMs, designers, everyone at a company, but also the way that organization is structured, and integrating itself in a different way. Everybody's got to come to the table.

Lenny (00:23:55):
Such a good point. And you have this actual term that you call user-centered performance, where it's the performance of being user-centered. Can you talk about that and then just what advice you'd give to PMs that, hearing this, are like, "Yes, I love everything you're saying," and then not realizing maybe they're too far in that extreme?

Judd Antin (00:24:11):
User-centered performance is a term I made up, because it's fun to make up terms. And it refers to customer obsession or a user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. So it's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. And if your listeners are like, "I don't do that." I'm like, "Think about it for a second." Because this is extremely common. It shows up in explicit ways and implicit ways. 

(00:24:52):
So explicitly, I would say every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, "Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions?" That's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. That PM is not interested in being wrong at all. It's too late in the game for that. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. So any check the box style research is a wild example of user-centered performance. 

(00:25:22):
I would argue every researcher has probably had to do executive listening sessions because a lot of PMs, founders, product people, but designers, too, they want to get close to the customer. And so, like, "Can I do some focus groups? I want to be there. I want to ask them questions." This is 97% performance. It's well-intentioned, but it isn't focused on learning. It isn't going to drive better outcomes or more impact. 

(00:25:49):
And then there's all these implicit ways that people engage in that kind of user performance, too. A lot of it comes down to cognitive biases, confirmation bias, ego. One of my big mantras was, "We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong." That is the mindset you should use when you're approaching insights and research. "I want to be wrong. I want you to do research that shows we were off base in the following ways. Tell me exactly how and why in a way that allows me to fix it quickly." But many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate. And that's user-centered performance.

Lenny (00:26:29):
Oh, man. I think a lot of people are hearing this and feeling exposed.

Judd Antin (00:26:33):
Exposed.

Lenny (00:26:35):
I feel like you're like this Deep Throat person coming from sharing these things people don't want to talk about at the office.

Judd Antin (00:26:35):
I know.

Lenny (00:26:42):
There's this quote in your post I'm going to read. "Product managers love to ask for middle range research that they can use to justify decisions they're reluctant to make on their own. User designers love to ask for middle range research because it fits their model of what proper design process should look like. Executives love to ask for middle range because they don't really understand what research is for, and helps them do performative user-centeredness. In the end, they will decide based on their own opinions."

Judd Antin (00:27:07):
There is an important place for intuition in product development, of course. The best designers, researchers, product people develop strong intuition for the product. But you got to understand, intuition is where all of those biases lie. It's where all your blind spots are. And what great insights people do, what great researchers do when you're next to them all the time, is they'll expose you. I don't have to be the Deep Throat, because you have somebody who's professional job is ... Keeping you honest is probably the wrong way to put it, but as somebody whose capabilities are about expanding your horizons, making it so that your intuition is constantly improving, you don't have to rely on it when your intuition and the evidence sort of collide in a way that either affirms or falsifies the product decision you made. Now something really good is happening. 

(00:28:00):
And the other thing that is inherent in that quote is I, at Airbnb, wore many hats over the years. I was head of research two different times. I was head of design for guest products. And my last job was I was head of the design studio, so UX research, UX design, writing, localization, they all reported up to me. So I've seen this from many disciplinary angles in the UX field. And researchers aren't the only ones who are guilty of this. I would say design has a ton of performance. And it comes from the fact that we have figured out user-centered design, this process, or design thinking, which IDEO popularized. Like, "That's what we're supposed to do, right? Bezos told us that we, as PMs, had to be customer obsessed. So that's what we're supposed to do."

(00:28:48):
It's a really common and damaging thing when we don't genuinely have that growth learning mindset, and it's easy to sideline researchers. We don't need them in that situation. We've got our guts. Isn't the gut where a great PM, a great founder needs to have that gut? And they do, but they need to be open to the fact that your gut, is limited, and biased, and narrow, and wrong sometimes.

Lenny (00:29:13):
The two sides of this is trust your gut opinion, "I don't need research, I don't need data. I have opinions, and my own experience, and I'm going to use the product, and let's just go with what feels right to me." Versus pure data-driven research driven for designers that are maybe listening for product managers. Do you have any advice for just where to fall on that spectrum and just how to best leverage research to inform that opinion?

Judd Antin (00:29:36):
Yeah, I taught a class at UC Berkeley this semester on leadership, and we talk about that a lot, because great leaders develop intuition. It's the pattern matching part of experience, where you develop heuristics which allow you to make good judgments even if you can't quite explain where that judgment came from. That's what the gut is. But it's also, like I said, where bias comes from, where all the cognitive biases, there's a list of 151 of them on Wikipedia, I won't name them, but all those thorny things that lead us astray, the behavioral economists and social psychologists study, those live in the gut. And so the advice is when you are looking to check your gut, you have to do that thing. A lot of your listeners have probably read Thinking Fast and Slow, System 1, System 2. Right? 

Lenny (00:30:29):
I have it here, right under my laptop, actually, holding up my laptop screen. 

Judd Antin (00:30:32):
That's so appropriate, Lenny. So the secret is not that sexy. It's System 2. So you engage that slow, methodical process in which you do analytic thinking as a means of checking your gut. Slow in the grand scheme of things. Slow meaning not a split second decision, not like months of analysis. That's not what I mean. 

(00:30:54):
The other thing you can do, and there's really great research on this, is you bring in the wisdom of the crowd. So the wisdom of the crowd is a phrase a lot of people are familiar with, and it works in a specific situation. The wisdom of the crowd works when the people involved with the decision are bringing diverse sources of information and judgment to the table. Obviously, if everybody has the same sources of information, then it doesn't matter how many people are out there. So if you want to check your gut, get a bunch of different guts together, get a bunch of different people in the room who can bring evidence and intuition to bear, and have an open, direct end kind conversation in which we might disagree. You know who's great at that? Researchers

Lenny (00:31:38):
Leading those discussions essentially, and getting a bunch of people's opinions.

Judd Antin (00:31:41):
Yeah, this is the structural solution I'm talking about, Lenny, is like, "I never asked for research teams to have their own separate OKRs." I said two things, "Number one, what's the teams? Shouldn't the PMs, the engineers, the designers and the research, everybody should have the same set of metrics for success because either we're doing it together or we're not." And then I said, "My metric for success is when they won't have that meeting without you." That's my metric for success. If they cannot have that decision making meeting without the researcher there, that means you've developed influence, strong, trusting relationships, you're an active participant in the process, not just somebody who provides input into someone else's process. And that is when researchers can have huge impact.

Lenny (00:32:29):
I think of the PM role in a similar way, even though people won't have these meetings with PMs, because they're often at the center of lot of the stuff, but you want to be a PM that people want on their team. There's a lot of teams that are like, "We don't want and PMs, we don't need product managers. They just get in the way." And I find that that's only the case when the product manager's not great, and not really good at their job, because most great PMs just make everyone's life easier.

Judd Antin (00:32:50):
They do. The grease, I-

Lenny (00:32:51):
The grease.

Judd Antin (00:32:53):
... love it.

Lenny (00:32:54):
You mentioned also, before we started recording, that the biggest challenge for user researchers is in their relationship with their product manager. Can you speak to that and what you've seen there?

Judd Antin (00:33:04):
I'm wary of overgeneralizing, but I can tell you that from my experience and from what I hear, the product research or product insights relationship is one of the most challenged. And I think it comes from the fact that fundamentally, many researchers are just not included in the process that PMs are running. And then, actually, I did some asking around before this podcast, and so I thought, "There are some tropes that researchers have about PMs that are worth PMs knowing, just like four or five of them, the things that researchers know PMs say, which drive us nuts because they're not true." 

(00:33:51):
So the first one is that research just slows us down. Research is too slow. This is bullshit. A great research team can do research in a day, a week, or a month. It just depends on what you want to get out of it, like, "How much detail do you need? How many people do we need to talk to? What is the depth or breadth? Do we need to go to seven different countries to talk about our constituencies in Latin America?" Well, that's not going to happen overnight, but we don't often need that. The other way to look at that is that is it slower to get it wrong and fix it than to take a hot second to do the work to get it right the first time? So that's BS. Good research doesn't slow us down, it speeds us up.

Lenny (00:34:36):
And also just along those lines, a big part of your premise is you don't need to do as much research as people are doing, like this middle research that a lot of the time is put into. 

Judd Antin (00:34:45):
Yeah. Research can go super fast. I think especially, so the macro level research, I hope what it is tied to things like annual planning processes. We did a thing at Airbnb several years that we called, it was like Insights 2019, Insights 2020. They were concept car projects. And we spent quite a long time synthesizing the entire year's worth of insights from every place we could get them and then developing with designers and engineers like a concept car for five years in the future. So that's a long process. 

(00:35:16):
But the micro level, there's so much business value to be derived there, so much business value, and it can go so fast, Lenny, it can go so fast. You can have results in 48 hours on these things. We did a thing at Airbnb. There's a famous story which I'll only tell in the abstract, because I don't want to out anything, but we call it the multimillion dollar button. And basically we did research which revealed that people weren't going down the purchase funnel because they were afraid. The calls to actions on the button was making them afraid that it would initiate a purchase when really it was just taking the next step. 

(00:35:58):
We changed the text on the button with help from our amazing content design, our UX writing team. We basically changed seven characters and made Airbnb millions of dollars, because what we found out was really simple. It was just like, "Hey, this button feels scary. The CTA on the button feels scary." So that's a great example of how micro ... And that happened in like 48 hours, we would discover that insight, or overnight, basically. And we were like, "Hm, maybe we should test some other CTAs." We did the conversion, we added like 1%, which is really, really hard to do. So that's a quick example of how that type of quick research can drive a huge amount of business value.

Lenny (00:36:39):

(00:37:29):
So just to make this even clearer, I think this middle research zone is the stuff that does slow people down, I imagine. It's like, "What are the challenges hosts have with payments on Airbnb?" What you're basically saying is, "Spend your time doing the micro stuff like usability research and then the bigger stuff that's part of overall planning. That's part of the planning cycle. It's not like every project you're working on, you need to have a whole research project on."

Judd Antin (00:37:55):
Exactly. The micro research should be much more common. A lot of researchers think that that's scut work, that usability is something junior researchers do. I completely disagree. I think we need to get back there as an industry and be like, "When you make a product easier to use, when you discover problems with functionality, business metrics we care about will go up." I've seen it happen. But that's not just work for interns and new grads, that's for sure. 

(00:38:24):
And then the planning process, absolutely. If we're integrated from beginning to end, we can help. And the thing about that middle range, I think you're right. That's the stuff that makes the stereotype that research is slow, and a lot of times it's also because it's just not pointed enough. The researcher can also say in that moment, "I have studied the business plan. I know exactly where, I've seen the metrics trend, I have an idea about exactly where that's going to go." We still need to do that middle range research. The question is valuable, but it's now very pointed and the time is worth it.

Lenny (00:38:58):
Amazing. Okay, I want to cure the rest of these tropes.

Judd Antin (00:39:01):
Okay, research is too slow is the first one. The second one, I can do my own research. Why do I need researchers? And that's true, as product people, I hope you are engaging with customers and listening well. But no offense, garbage in, garbage out. The thing is, anyone can talk to a user. That does not constitute research or insights work because one user can be powerful, but one user can be idiosyncratic. And a researcher knows how to get to the heart of that really quick. They know how to take that conversation, and understand, and situate it in a way which means like, "Sure, democratize research. That's happening. There are tools out there that will let anybody get customer feedback, voice a customer type stuff." But a researcher is there to help you turn garbage into something that's not garbage and avoid the bias that can come from you just reaching out to your cousin's family and then doing whatever they thought you should do to the product. So that's the second trope. 

(00:40:08):
The third one is AB test everything. And AB tests are great, but one of my most painful things to do is to sit in a room full of PMs and data scientists who have just seen the results of an experiment that flipped a stat sig, and then they're like, "Cool, I was significantly down over this course of time for these users." And then they just start speculating about why that is, because the AB test rarely tells you why it changed in the way it did. And then this endless flywheel of AB testing goes and I'm like, "Hey, you don't have to guess. I know somebody who can get you an answer or at least evidence that addresses the question of why did we see the test result we did in a very short amount of time? Or you could use your customers as Guinea pigs, and throw more experiments at them over and over, and spend a long time on it, and come to the same place in the end."

Lenny (00:41:03):
I think a similar critique that PMs often have is AB testing is conclusive scientifically, statistically, user research is just talking to a bunch of people. Why would I trust that? What is your best way to help PMs realize that this is actually very valuable data and you should listen to it? It's not just, you know, a story here and there. 

Judd Antin (00:41:26):
Yeah. No, I think they're both right. AB testing is as close as we can get to making causal claims about products. Research is usually not oriented towards making causal claims or it should not be, but those causal claims rarely tell you how and why things happen. And if you want to not make that mistake again in the future, you need to know how and why. If you want to build a better product in a way that doesn't just answer this narrow question that an AB test answered, you need to know how and why. And so you need both. Beautiful partnerships between data scientists and research and insights people are, I think what we're going to see in that next evolution. And if you set that virtuous cycle up, if you set up the engagement where those people are involved from the beginning, you don't make those mistakes. You get the causal relationship, which is valuable for one reason and the hows and whys, which are valuable for other reasons. 

Lenny (00:42:19):
Awesome. Okay. I think there's two more tropes you had. 

Judd Antin (00:42:23):
One of them is a simple one, which is like everyone loves to quote that it turns out a totally apocryphal Henry Ford quote about, "If I'd asked my users." It turns out to the best of our knowledge, he did not say that. And-

Lenny (00:42:35):
Really? What?

Judd Antin (00:42:36):
Yeah, I know. Isn't that sad? 

Lenny (00:42:36):
I didn't know that.

Judd Antin (00:42:38):
I know. Sorry to burst your bubble, Lenny. 

Lenny (00:42:40):
Oh, wow. 

Judd Antin (00:42:41):
Who was-

Lenny (00:42:41):
Does anyone say anything? I feel like every quote is-

Judd Antin (00:42:44):
Is apocryphal, now? I know. 

Lenny (00:42:46):
Yeah. What is reality? Geez, can we? Well, let's just- 

Judd Antin (00:42:49):
Okay, maybe he said that. He certainly believed that. That's what the historians say. But the reason that makes researchers so angry is because that's not research. That's not what researchers do. A researcher who's going to ask customers what they want is a bad researcher. You need a different researcher. I've never done that in my career. No one on my team has ever run a study that's like that. So that just makes researchers mad.

(00:43:16):
And then the last one is about post-hoc bias. It's, "We knew this already. That was obvious." And I think a lot about this book, which I would recommend to your listeners. The author is a sociologist at UPenn named Duncan Watts, and the title is Everything is Obvious If You Already Know the Answer. And it's about hindsight bias. He makes the argument that we rely too much on intuition, heuristics, and pattern matching in a way that is inappropriate to our experience. And it's like it leads us astray. It's like a form of self gaslighting. And it happens because we end up selectively remembering things and then constructing narratives around them in a way which makes us feel like we already knew that, when we in fact did not.

(00:44:05):
And he talks about this other, one of those cognitive biases called the narrative fallacy, which is the idea that people love to make convenient, simple stories about the past. If I asked you about your career, Lenny, and how you got to be this amazing podcast host, you'd be like, "Well, let me tell you about this series of events." And we do that. It's part of how we make sense of our lives and the information around us, but it would probably be a lie in the sense that we all twist the evidence we have to fit the narrative we want to be true, because it's simple, and lovely, and makes us happy.

Lenny (00:44:36):
This is going to sound self-serving, but I find I'm the opposite. I'm like, "I have no idea how this all came about. Here's some things that happened, and somehow I ended up here." But maybe I'm being very modest and try to not give myself any credit.

Judd Antin (00:44:49):
That's beautiful.

Lenny (00:44:50):
Thank you for these tropes, by the way. This was fun. I didn't know you were going to do that. So that's a fun, little collection we've got, here. 

Judd Antin (00:44:54):
Thanks.

Lenny (00:44:56):
I wanted to ask about, there's this tweet by Patrick Collison that I've brought up a couple of times on this podcast, that I think is really interesting. And his tweet is this, "In my opinion, the best product will stem from a very strong mental model of the domain and user. User research can help you get such a model and validate it along the way. But it's important to view the syllogism of UXR as model of user research, to improving your mental model of the user, to what product you should build versus user research tells you what product to build." Does that resonate in any way thoughts on that way of thinking about user research?

Judd Antin (00:45:34):
Yeah, there's a double-edged sword we talk about a lot in the research community, which is about making recommendations for design. So the best research doesn't leave it at that. It tells you, and it's like the what, the so what, and then the then what. But the problem with that is some researchers go too far in the other direction, where they're like, "We ran this study, it yielded these insights, and therefore this is what we should build." And everyone else on the team is like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Glad to hear your thoughts on the matter, but there's a lot going on here. Maybe we should talk about it." And that makes perfect sense. That's a failure of communication. 

(00:46:19):
And I think that speaks to the thing that Patrick is saying, is like, "Good research can sometimes tell us exactly what the problem is and exactly how to fix it." An example of that is the multimillion dollar button I told you about. But in a lot of the bigger picture questions, especially the macro ones and maybe also the really pointed middle range ones, the point isn't really, "This is exactly what we should do and this is exactly what we should build." It is, "Let us develop a framework which is based on actual evidence, and then together as a team figure out how we want to experiment our way to a successful product."

Lenny (00:46:53):
To close the loop on this specific thread, what is your advice to teams, researchers to help move out of this reckoning, and to move forward, and help the field, both from a user researcher perspective and also from just a company that maybe laid off a bunch of user researchers or is trying to decide what to do with their researchers?

Judd Antin (00:47:14):
Thank you for asking. I think I said to you earlier, and I feel some pressure as maybe the first conversation that you've had specifically about research on this podcast.

Lenny (00:47:23):
Yeah, I think so. 

Judd Antin (00:47:25):
And I want to help. I believe so much in this discipline of research and insights, and I think when I said, "The UX research discipline of the last 15 years is dying," I didn't mean that I think research is dying, far from it. I think that there's a version of it, which we're now moving past and into a new version. We're going through an evolution, as many do. And so the question for me is like, "How can researchers, and the companies, and the other people with whom they work create a new version, a different version, an evolution, which is hugely impactful for the business?" 

(00:47:57):
And so the advice I'd give to researchers about that is develop diverse research skills. Remembering the five or five and a half tool list that I mentioned earlier, really go deep on that business knowledge, so speaking the language of product, and business, and metrics, and understanding exactly how to use your insights like a scalpel, building those strong relationships, which is not a thing that researchers can do by themselves. It requires two-way engagements, and also in a way which allows researchers to do fewer things better. 

(00:48:30):
So most researchers that I know are working on teams where they're like, "I'm the only researcher, and I have seven PMs and 20 designers, and I'm trying to do 10 projects." And no one's going to do a good job that way. So researchers have to learn with their partners about how to say no and focus on the most important things. But that's only half of it, right? That's the research side. 

(00:48:51):
I have two thoughts about what companies should be doing. The first one, it's a little bit of an aside, but not really. One thing I learned by through the responses to the article was everybody came out of the woodworks from the variety of insights disciplines that are out there. Because I come from a tradition of user experience research or user research, but there are many insights disciplines in many industries, and they all wanted to claim one type of research or another, and say, "Oh, well, we overhear in consumer insights or market research have been doing that well for years." And there are many insights disciplines. And generally I think creating silos is stupid. 

(00:49:33):
Actually, I'm curious what you think, because here's the number one thing I heard when I joined Airbnb and you were there, is I did it a quick listening tour where I talked to a bunch of product people. And they all said the same thing. They were like, "Listen, we have all these different people throwing insights over the transom. And it's great. We want to hear from the data scientists, from the product specialists, from the customer service people, and the voice of the customer, whatever, all that stuff. But they're all coming over the side and we don't know what to make of it. It's too much."

(00:50:03):
And that, as much as anything, is an argument for companies to stop siloing research disciplines. So when I joined Airbnb, I set out to create an integrated insights function where it's like, "Let's do UX research, let's talk about the market and competitors when we have to. Let's integrate smartly with data science functions. Let's integrate all the stuff we're getting from customer service feedback." We brought over what was then the NPS program and said, "Hey, if we're getting customer feedback there, let's all just use it all to fuel this one insights machine." So that's the first piece of advice I'd give companies.

(00:50:38):
And the second one, without being a broken record, is to think differently about the broken cycle. So integrate researchers into a unified, lean process. So if the researcher is not there from beginning to end, if there are not strong relationships between product people and design people at every level, engineering people at every level, and somebody who's their insights partner, we're going to fall back into this problem where we're just a service discipline, we're not extracting the maximum value, it comes too late, we don't know what questions to ask, we're ignorant about what research can do. And so creating that integrated, lean process where a researcher is arm in arm from the beginning, is the most important advice I'd give.

Lenny (00:51:19):
That last piece may be the answer to this next question, but the question is how can product managers be better partners to user researchers/get more leverage out of user researchers?

Judd Antin (00:51:31):
I think that is in many ways the answer, making sure that they are creating a process for the product, for their products, that it integrates user researchers and insights from beginning to end. Also, being willing to partner with the research on the roofless prioritization. I used to say that, "A full plate for a researcher was probably three things, two big projects and a small project, like a side project. More than that, your researcher is probably not doing a very good job. And a project may take 48 hours. That's okay. But so they need your help to prioritize, they need you to participate. Great PMs will take the time to be with researchers to go into the field, even to travel." Did you ever do that, Lenny?

Lenny (00:52:15):
I did. I went with Louise, who introduced, we came up with this, basically told me to chat with you about this topic. 

Judd Antin (00:52:23):
Thanks, Louise.

Lenny (00:52:24):
Thanks, Louise. We did a whole tour to Paris, our whole team, or the leads of our team went to Paris to do a bunch of focus groups and a bunch of user research behind actual mirrors. I've never done that before that trip, and it was amazing. We learned a ton.

Judd Antin (00:52:38):
Can I tell you a quick story about behind the mirror? 

Lenny (00:52:40):
Please.

Judd Antin (00:52:41):
This is back from when I was at Facebook. And there was the high times there, it was like 2012, '13, and newsfeed is really taking off, ads are going into newsfeed. And I was a leader of a team that was working among other things on how to address post quality. Like, "How do we think about what's a good post and how do we get feedback about it?" And so there was a team of engineers that thought, "One thing that you can do on Facebook is hide a post." So they were like, "This is easy. Let's look at the posts that are hidden the most and use that as the signal of what's a good post on Facebook?" Seems reasonable. And something tripped me on this one. And so I did two things.

(00:53:26):
So the first thing I did is I looked at the distribution of hiding by user, and found out that it's power law distributed, like everything on the internet. There are a few people on Facebook who hide a ton, and then most people don't hide at all. And so then what we did was, we call these super hiders, we called them super hiders. And so we said, "Let's find super hiders around the office, and we'll get a super hider in, and we'll do a really traditional user interview." We just wanted to see. So literally the first person who walked in, I remember, because this was a person who had those fingernails that are so long, you don't know how they can do touchscreens, but they did. They were amazing at it. And it was one of those rooms with the glass. And I insisted that the ENG directors, the product people, and they were willing, whatever.

(00:54:20):
So everybody's behind the glass, and I'm there with them, and the excellent researcher is in the room, and they come in, and we're just doing a traditional think aloud study. And so they go, "Hey, can you open up your Facebook app? We would just love to see what your experience is like." So they open up Facebook, and were looking, and they look at the first story, and they hide it. They go to the second story and they hide it. And this went on for a while. 

(00:54:43):
And she's definitely using Facebook, but every time she'd finish with a story, she'd hide it. And the people in the back room were starting to chatter. And they're like, "Wait, what? What is happening right now?" And like the good researcher that this person was, they let it continue, and they're like, "Whoa, can you tell me what you're thinking right now?" Come to find out that she was like, "Well, I hid that story because I'd seen it already." The model she was going for was inbox zero, which was sad, because it was infinitely scrolling. She would never get there. 

(00:55:16):
And the reason I liked that story is because the people in the back room had their minds blown. It was not that we assumed that was common behavior, like this person could have been unique, but it was enough, because those people were there, experiencing the research, that N of one allowed them to burst their own bubble and realize, "Okay, we can't think so naïvely about hides as a signal anymore." And we came up with a better solution.

Lenny (00:55:47):
That is an awesome story and such a good example of you don't need statistical significance to get massive insights. One example just gives you a, "Wow, this might be exactly what's happening. Let's go validate that." Versus, like, "We are confident, 100%, this is what happened." I love that. It reminds me actually in the mirror study that I was talking about in Paris, there's a Facebook element to it, too. We were trying to convince hosts how to feel more comfortable accepting guests who are booking instantly. And one of our theories was if they were connected on Facebook, they would be more comfortable letting someone book instantly. 

Judd Antin (00:55:47):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:21):
And we're just like, "Hey, what if you were to connect Facebook and see if they're friends?" And everybody in Paris was very afraid of connecting and giving Facebook any data, way ahead of what the US hosts were feeling. 

Judd Antin (00:56:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:34):
So it just made it very clear nobody wants to actually give Facebook any data. So it was very anti-Facebook at that point.

Judd Antin (00:56:40):
Yeah, that's so interesting. Germany and France were always our bellwethers for what the rest of the world would be thinking with data privacy concerns.

Lenny (00:56:49):
Oh, man. Okay, a couple more things. A lot of this started with a lot of layoffs within user research. And I think between the lines, there's a sense of teams don't need as many researchers as they hired during the ZIRP era. I think a question in everyone's mind is just like, "How many researchers do we need? What is a good ratio?" I imagine there's not a simple answer, here, but just what's your general advice to companies of how many researchers is it right?

Judd Antin (00:57:15):
This is a thing I've thought a lot about, especially in my role as the head of the design studio, that was my fundamental question. It's like, "You have all these writers, designers, researchers, how do you structure them, how many, and where, and who works on what?" And the organizing principle for me was always relationships. You know you have enough when the people who need to have a concept research partner have them. And I would much rather create pain in that situation than spread someone too thinly. So my advice was always like, "Don't try to create a researcher to cover this entire product space. Pair a researcher up with somebody who's going to involve them in a consistent, engaged process, and let them go to work, and see the impact they're going to have, but protect their time. And then other people are like, "Wait a second, that person's doing great work. I want some of that."

(00:58:02):
And creating that pain for them, because it's a pain of loss, is the number one way to grow headcount. That's how I always approached getting more headcount, was not arguing abstractly for why research is important, but by asking partners who wish they had it, to do the arguing for me. And so you're right, there isn't a clean answer for like, "Hey, this is the right ratio," because it really depends on the nature of the product. Like, "Is it a early stage product? Is it a late stage product? Are we talking about a startup or a late stage company?" But I would argue there's always room for a researcher. Lenny, I'll tell you, and I used this in a keynote talk I gave lately. You published recently a list of, I think it was about 20 B2B companies and their first 10 employees. Do you remember doing that?

Lenny (00:58:51):
Absolutely.

Judd Antin (00:58:52):
Do you remember how many researchers are anywhere on that list? I'll give you a hint.

Lenny (00:58:57):
Not too many.

Judd Antin (00:58:57):
It's between zero and two. It's one. There's one researcher on that list, anywhere. Anywhere. And that's messed up to me. Now, look, it's just these 20 companies, and each is in their own space, so I'm not going to overgeneralize. But a researcher can drive incredible value no matter what stage a company is at, because a good researcher makes you go faster, not slower, and they drive impact because they answer questions which are impossible to answer in any other way. That's true if you're a startup. It's true if you're a late stage company. Now, if it's your first 10 employees, one researcher is going to go a long way. As you grow, making sure that you're matching up researchers so that they have strong partners in the key parts of the business is the best way to figure out if you have enough.

Lenny (00:59:45):
Interesting. So your advice is, as you're starting a company, your pitch is that you'll have a lot more leverage and move faster hiring a researcher versus generally an engineers, but you'd be trading off, essentially. That's what most of the hires end up being.

Judd Antin (00:59:58):
I am reluctant to overgeneralize, and I would say I know many founders who are in startup mode are like, "I know what I need to build. The problem is that I need people who can help me execute." And I think that's right. And so everything's a trade off. But remember, imagine that you could have that Swiss army knife at your disposal. Maybe you've got an MVP out the door, and you're looking to make your first major iteration, or like many startups, you need to pivot. This is where it's like, "Hey, you don't have to do that alone." We deify startup founders who pivot appropriately, but I think that is what we would might call moral luck, where we deify the ones who got it right, and even though they made exactly the same decisions as the one who got them wrong. 

(01:00:46):
And the fact of the matter is, if you have an insights person with you who has that Swiss army knife of tools, you're not in it alone. You don't have to guess. Ultimately, it will still come down to a tough decision that you and founders have to make, but you can have evidence that bears on that decision, which you wouldn't be able to get any other way.

Lenny (01:01:05):
To close out on this, and I have just a couple more questions on this thread, I think one of your big messages to researchers is, "You can be empowered. It's up to you to do the right sort of research and to move your career in the right direction, not become a researcher people don't need." And there's this quote that you have at the top of your post, where a lot of the reaction, or I guess the way you put it is, "I know what you're thinking, they just don't get it. We're so misunderstood. Our plight is to deliver insights that users use to drive business value while we're forgotten, never driving the roadmap, no seat at the table, consistently miscast, only to be laid off in the end." And what I'm hearing from you is like, "You can change that. You can push back on doing research that isn't actually contributing." But let me ask you, what's your lasting, I don't know, advice you would leave researchers with to be successful?

Judd Antin (01:01:56):
Yeah, it's tough to be operating in a broken system, and so I feel that response, where you feel kind of powerless, but I think that's not likely to lead us past this moment to the next evolution of research. So that's where it's like I don't blame any researcher at all for being in the spot they're in. It's been a tough go. However, crying about our lot is not going to get us anywhere. So I think the point of the article for me, and this is advice I give companies all the time when I do consulting with them, is like, "Hey, we can set this up in a different way, which responds to the current environment in a way which will drive a huge amount of impact." Now, that takes companies making the right choices. It also takes researchers owning up and developing skills, pushing back, understanding what research can have the most value, developing the skills, and the knowledge, and language around the business, becoming more influential, being excellent communicators.

(01:02:55):
It's one of the things I would evaluate the most in hiring, especially research leaders, because I needed them to show and teach by example, is like isn't just rigorous research. It's like if a tree fell in the forest and no one was there to hear it, you need to communicate it effectively, and you need to do it in a way that's appropriate to the audience. Because If I'm talking to you, Lenny, it's different than I'm talking to Brian Chesky at Airbnb. And so I got to be able to give that presentation effectively, and get right to the heart of it, and speak the right language. And so if you're a researcher, it's not hopeless. Actually the discipline, the future is so bright, and we can help it along by continuing to develop these different skills as companies build a model that's more inclusive.

Lenny (01:03:38):
Awesome. Okay. I have one just random, tangential question about NPS. You have strong opinions about NPS, and I just wanted to hear your perspective on the value of NPS, your experience with NPS. 

Judd Antin (01:03:50):
Yeah. I do have a strong opinion about NPS. I like to say, "NPS is the best example of the marketing industry marketing itself." And the problem is this threatens many people's livelihoods, because there's an entire industry of consultants and software providers that want you to believe NPS is a useful and accurate metric. The problem is, the consensus in the survey science community is that NPS makes all the mistakes. So it's a garbage in, garbage out problem. So the likelihood to recommend question is bad for a whole variety of reasons. So it's bad because it's a zero to 11 scale. It's bad because it's usually unlabeled. So we label the polls, but that's not the gold standard for research. It's bad because it's 11 items. 

(01:04:37):
And there's a couple of problems with that. Number one, we find that precision goes down after five items on average, maybe seven. Number two, especially on mobile, if you're taking this survey, what percentage of those options are below the fold? We are not going to get accurate survey data. And so from a survey perspective, it's really bad. There's also this intuition, which is like, "How likely are you to recommend Windows 11 to your friends and family?" I am not a person who goes around recommending operating systems. The question is fundamentally flawed. 

(01:05:11):
The argument is that that question is a good indicator of loyalty, but there's a really simple solution, Lenny. Customer satisfaction, a simple CSAT metric, is better. It has better data properties, it is more precise, it is more correlated to business outcomes. I wanted to prove this. This is something that survey scientists know and marketers don't want you to know. And so we did the work with Mike Murakami, who led survey science at Airbnb, and he's still there, great researcher. And we basically redid all that work to find out if all that stuff was true just for Airbnb. And it is. It's simple. Don't ask NPS, ask customer satisfaction

Lenny (01:05:50):
And the customer satisfaction question, what's the actual question for people to make sure?

Judd Antin (01:05:54):
Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience with Airbnb? Or it could be some version of that, which is like, "Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience with customer service when you had a problem?" So there could be a more specific version of that question, but those questions have better properties. And a lot of people say, "Well, hey, everybody's using NPS. So at least it gives me a benchmark because I can compare my NPS to industry NPS." The problem with that is the research shows that NPS is idiosyncratic, so it goes up and downs in ways that we don't understand, and there's a lot of inconsistency in how it's asked, that creates variations in the data, which means it's not apples to apples, so you can't even compare your NPS meaningfully to somebody else's.

Lenny (01:06:37):
I love these hot takes. I'm curious to see who comes out of the woodwork, too, when-

Judd Antin (01:06:41):
People are going to be so mad, Lenny.

Lenny (01:06:42):
I love that. I think, yeah, I've heard this many times and people don't talk about it. Okay. Is there anything else you want to share or leave people with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Judd Antin (01:06:54):
Can I? Yeah, I want to add one thing if I could, because this has come up on your podcast a few times recently, which is about the idea of people doing their own product walkthroughs. So should a PM just rely on their own dog fooding of the product and their own walkthrough to figure out how to fix it? And a couple of times recently this has come up, and I think the consensus seems to be, "Yes, this is a good thing." And I have a contrarian opinion there, too, which is that I think it is really important for everyone to dog food their own products. The problem is related to relying on your intuition about those products, which is the thing most PMs have trouble with is realizing, "You are nothing like the user. You are nothing like them in ways that will bias the way you think about what's good and bad in your product in ways that you can't necessarily recognize. Some things with a product, some problems with a product, you need a pulse to recognize."

(01:07:57):
And most good PMs that I know have a pulse and so cool. But a lot of them require context of use, priorities, constraints that you just don't have and you can't imagine purely on the basis of your own usage. So what I think that means is that you should definitely dog food your own product. Doing product walkthroughs to identify lists of potential issues is a great thing to do. Prioritizing that list, figuring out which ones are more or less a problem, and for whom is an area where you should be extremely wary of relying on your own opinion, expertise, or intuition when you are dog fooding your own product.

Lenny (01:08:39):
Thank you for sharing that. It's definitely come up a bunch on this podcast, so I think that's an important lesson for people to take away. Anything else before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Judd Antin (01:08:49):
I appreciate you, Lenny. Thanks for having me on. 

Lenny (01:08:51):
I appreciate you, Judd. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Judd Antin (01:08:56):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:08:57):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Judd Antin (01:09:02):
I recently read a business book by Barbara Kellerman called Bad Leadership. And what I love about it is that we spend a lot of time talking about good leaders, and she really dives into the worst leaders and what makes them bad leaders in a way that I think is really valuable for everybody. 

(01:09:19):
I'd also recommend, I read a lot of fiction, so two recommendations, there. One, a recent Pulitzer Prize winner, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver. It's an outstanding read that also is really sad, and moving, and illustrative, especially if you want to understand rural poverty. And then completely other side of the fiction spectrum, if you're interested in science fiction, which I am, read the Murderbot Diaries, it's about a sarcastic killer robot. And who doesn't love them?

Lenny (01:09:48):
I love these fiction recommendations. I feel like we need more of these on the podcast, so thank you. 

Judd Antin (01:09:52):
Yeah. Everybody goes to business books.

Lenny (01:09:53):
Yeah, absolutely. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Judd Antin (01:09:59):
We recently watched The Last of Us and it blew our mind. I watched it after I played the video game after long last, if you are a person who plays video games and you haven't played The Last of Us, play it. If you don't know, the show is based on the video game, not the other way around.

Lenny (01:10:14):
Do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Judd Antin (01:10:19):
Think of a topic that you had to explain lately that was the most complex, and then explain it to me like I'm five. And there are a lot of ways to vary that question, but the reason I like it is because I think, and I've asked this question to VP and C-suite candidates in multiple disciplines, and sometimes it's related to a conversation, like I might ask them to explain something complicated about quantum computing, or music theory, or it could be a complex business decision, but I want to see if somebody can break a complex problem down in a really simple way, and give me an intuition for it in a short amount of time. I think that is a differentiator between good and great for many people.

Lenny (01:11:02):
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?

Judd Antin (01:11:06):
Yeah, this is a really weird one, but my whole family started indoor rock climbing recently, and there's a challenge you have when you top rope, which is that you're looking up all the time. So they make these glasses, which are called belay glasses, and they have an angled mirror embedded in the lens, so that you can look straight ahead, and the view you see is up towards the person who you're belaying. And I just thought that product is so perfect for that. That's a niche problem and there isn't a better way to solve it.

Lenny (01:11:37):
Do you have a favorite motto that you often come back to, that you share with friends either in work or in life that you find useful?

Judd Antin (01:11:44):
Yeah. This is going to seem like pandering, Lenny, but I don't know if you remember a conversation that you and I had, it must've been eight years ago. I remember where we were sitting. And it was about stoicism. Do you remember this? Anyway, we had this conversation.

Lenny (01:11:59):
I don't, but I was into stoicism for a while.

Judd Antin (01:12:01):
I know you were, because we talked about it. And so the motto comes from stoicism, which is basically, "Focus on the things you can control and ignore the rest." And a lot of people think of this as the serenity prayer or the serenity saying, that was a 20th century invention, but Epictetus was writing about this BC, and I think about it all the time. So much of the stress, and pain, and worry that we have in life comes from things we can't control. So I try to let those things go.

Lenny (01:12:34):
Amazing. I learned that lesson from 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and just the importance of thinking about these circles of you can control, you can influence, and you have no control over, and there's no reason to think about those other things.

Judd Antin (01:12:46):
Absolutely.

Lenny (01:12:47):
Judd, this was everything I hoped it would be. We got into some really good stuff. I'm excited to hear how people react. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to learn about what you're up to, actually share what you're up to these days, and how people can find you, and then also how can listeners be useful to you? 

Judd Antin (01:13:01):
Yeah. Thanks for asking those questions. People can find me at juddantin.com. That's the best way to find out what I'm up to. These days, I'm a consultant. I help people with UX strategy, org design, and crisis management. Somehow I love dealing with other people's dumpster fires, and I've found that I'm constitutionally good at it somehow. So juddantin.com is the place to find out. I also write. I write a medium post that you can find at onebigthought.com. And you'll find a lot of the topics we talked about today, including the original post that started this at onebigthought.com. If there's one thing I could ask your listeners to do is to get next to your researcher. I just think if you build those relationships and involve a researcher and insights person early and often, beautiful things will happen for you and for the business. So that's the thing everyone can do for me.

Lenny (01:13:56):
I love that. I've always done that. I loved my researchers that I've worked with, many of them reporting to you, and so beautiful takeaway. Judd, thank you so much for being here.

Judd Antin (01:14:07):
Lenny, thank you. It's been a pleasure.

## Transcript

Jules Walter (00:00:00):
If you give me feedback, I'll be like, "Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful," because people are like, "Oh, he actually likes the feedback." Now, inside my heart might be melting. I'm like, "Oh, I thought I got better at this." You know what I mean? 

Lenny (00:00:14):
Yeah. 

Jules Walter (00:00:14):
But externally, I'm like, "Hey, thank you," and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.

Lenny (00:00:26):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Jules Walter. Jules is a product leader at YouTube. Before that, he spent four and a half years at Slack, where he was their first growth PM and then went on to lead their monetization teams and also their mobile team. He's also the co-founder and a board member of the Black Product Managers Network and CodePath, both of which are nonprofits that aim to increase diversity within tech. Jules and I have collaborated on a number of projects over the years, including a killer guest post on building product sense that continues to be one of the most shared and beloved posts in my newsletter. 

(00:01:04):
In our conversation, we focus on what skills matter most in advancing a PM's career, and more importantly, all the ways Jules has found to build those skills. We also go deep on mentorship, how to find a mentor, what to look for in a mentor, how to get someone to agree to be a mentor, and a lot more. I super enjoyed this conversation, which I'm sure you can tell. Jules is such a gem of a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Jules Walter after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:36):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful, and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod.

(00:03:49):
Jules, welcome to the podcast.

Jules Walter (00:03:52):
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm really excited.

Lenny (00:03:54):
I am even more excited. This chat has been a long time coming. I've been hoping to get you on this podcast ever since this podcast even launched. And then in the meantime, while we've been waiting to schedule it, a number of guests have mentioned how useful you've been to them in their career, and so I'm just really excited to finally have you on.

Jules Walter (00:04:11):
Yeah, same here.

Lenny (00:04:12):
Let's just start with a quick overview of your background. Could you share some of the wonderful places you've worked, some of the wonderful projects you've worked on, and then just a bit about what you're working on today?

Jules Walter (00:04:25):
Yeah, happy to. Some quick background, grew up in Haiti, studied computer science in college, went to business school. My first career was actually not in tech; it was in medical devices. I was a GM for a company based out of France and also overseeing West Africa business for them. After doing that, I moved back to the US, launched my own startup, which didn't work out, and then I moved to the Bay Area roughly eight years ago. In the Bay Area I wanted to become a PM, which was really hard to get into. At first, I joined a startup, series a company, became head of product for them, and then join Slack as the first PM on their growth team. Then from their, help scale the growth team at Slack. When I joined revenue was around 50 million; when I left roughly four years ago was 10x that. And then after Slack I recently joined YouTube Google about two years ago. At Google I'm a product lead at YouTube, where I'm driving a product called Primetime Channels, which actually recently launched in November in the US. And in that product, we're bringing streaming services to YouTube so that users can watch their favorite movies, shows, and sports content.

Lenny (00:05:35):
Amazing. The reason that I think we pushed this schedule of this podcast recording out is because you've been working on that product for many months and I'm glad to hear that it's finally launched. How did the launch go?

Jules Walter (00:05:45):
So far so good. It's really exciting to take a product from nothing to something. 

Lenny (00:05:49):
Especially at a company like Google.

Jules Walter (00:05:51):
Yeah. And then over time we are adding more exciting content onto the product. We just recently you announced that we're adding NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023 to primetime channels and also to YouTube TV. It's been a really exciting project.

Lenny (00:06:05):
That's awesome. I bet there's a lot of stories there, but I know you can't talk too much about what's happening at Google, so we'll move on. I like the point that you made about joining a startup, like you were trying to get into product management and you joined a startup as their first PM. I think you mentioned that's how you got into the PM path or I guess... Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's an interesting example of one of the paths into product management: joining a startup, getting into product there.

Jules Walter (00:06:27):
Not as their first PM, but I joined as one of their first PMs. Yeah. 

Lenny (00:06:31):
As one of their first PMs? 

Jules Walter (00:06:32):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:06:33):
That's something I hear often is just one of the paths to product management is join a startup, start doing product, and then you're a PM. And then you have a PM title on your resume and you can now join other companies. Is that something you found or anything you can take away from that experience?

Jules Walter (00:06:46):
Yeah. It's really, really hard to get into product and there isn't a really set path to do that. What I've seen is the path that we just talked about, join a startup and then from there go into different companies. And then the other path that is typical is being at a company and then switching product management, especially if you develop domain expertise and there's a need for a PM. So, that's even more frequent. Of course there's also acquisitions that sort of thing, but making that initial transition is really hard.

Lenny (00:07:19):
I didn't realize you were the first growth PM at Slack. That is a big role. How did that work out? How did you become the first growth PM at Slack? Was that the first time you're doing growth? What's the story there?

Jules Walter (00:07:30):
I joined Slack early 2016 and the role that was available at the time was growth. I did not know anything about growth, but I was like, "Hey, this is my way in at such a great company." So, that's what I joined to do. And then what I did there was really take a learning mindset and lean on mentors, and we can talk about that to really learn the practice of growth and applied for Slack.

Lenny (00:08:00):
Cool. We're definitely going to talk about some of those things. Just thinking about that experience and that ride at Slack, what's like maybe the most tangible memory or most, I don't know, interesting story of just riding that rocket ship of Slack growth as one of their early PMs?

Jules Walter (00:08:14):
There's many, many stories. My experience was I got in, didn't know much about growth, and then through mentorship, in particular, one mentor, Bangaly Kaba, sort of learned how to apply growth frameworks to my work. And then when I did that within six months, I was able to ship changes in the new user experience, especially on mobile. That moved the needle by a lot, like double-digit percentages within your [inaudible 00:08:38]. And we're talking about top line metrics like activation. It was just interesting being able to have such impact very quickly at a company, and then the company itself went through all these milestones. I mentioned I joined 50 million, the next thing it's a hundred, and it keep doubling, going through a public offering. So, there's just so many stories that are unique to hyper growth.

Lenny (00:09:01):
You also didn't mention in your background all these kind of extracurricular activities that you have. I've always been impressed with how much time you put into things that are kind of just volunteer projects on the side. Can you talk about some of the stuff that you do outside of your actual day job?

Jules Walter (00:09:15):
Outside of my work at YouTube now and also my family and young kids, I'm also involved with two nonprofits that I co-founded. Both of them are actually about improving diversity in tech, which is something I'm really passionate about. The first one is called CodePath and it's improving diversity for software engineers, and the second one is Black PMs focused on product management. With CodePath specifically, what we do is we train over 5,000 students every year at universities, typically the university with strong underrepresented populations, and we help them find internships and jobs at top tech companies. And then with Black PMs, we have a community of over a thousand PMs and aspiring PMs and then we help them find community and also grow their skills. Both of them are nonprofits that I wasn't actually setting out to build them. It's more like I had the need myself or I wish I had those sort of support when I was earlier in my career. And then I started helping folks and then one thing led to the other, especially my co-founders, and then these became big.

Lenny (00:10:22):
Sounds like a classic startup story, solve your own problem and turns into a larger and larger thing. I think I try to work with Black PMs as much as I can, and I know that you recently had a conference, which is so cool. I don't know, it was a really big conference that you organized. I don't know how you all had time for all that, but anything you can share about this conference and is there another one coming?

Jules Walter (00:10:42):
Now we have a really good team at Black PMs. The CEO, Brittany Bankston and the team, Benin Saffo and others, have helped put together that amazing conference that I was able to attend. It's amazing that it's hard for underrepresented community to see themselves in podcasts, at conferences, at speakers, that sort of thing. So, it gave that opportunity and it also enables us to realize that you're not alone. Because part of why I created Black PMs with my co-founders is... Actually, I'll tell you the story. 

(00:11:17):
I think it was around 2016, I was at a barbecue. I met another Black PM, Maryanna Quigless. I didn't know her and I was like, "Oh, you're a Black PM at Facebook. How many of you are there at the company?" And we're joking and we're like, "Hey, I bet we can list all the Black PMs we know." And we had basically roughly 15 between the two of us and we're like, "Hey, let's bring them all together in a room and to have a community." From there, started helping each other and that grew from 15 to now over a thousand.

Lenny (00:11:45):
Wow. Amazing. It's really inspiring, the work that you do. I don't know how you find time for all this. I love that you found ways to kind of delegate this and have other people run the program now.

Jules Walter (00:11:55):
Yeah. Now, I'm mostly on the board of these organizations. We have really solid teams for both Black PMs and CodePath, and the teams are just really amazing.

Lenny (00:12:03):
This touches on the stuff that I want to spend most of our time on our chat, which is around mentorship and just generally becoming a stronger product manager through all the ways you can become a stronger product manager. You mentioned you had a lot of great mentors. I've heard from other people, you've been a great mentor to them and you've also just been really successful at a number of really world-class companies. What I want to chat about is just, what have you found to be the most important skills to develop as a PM as you advance in your career, and then how to actually build those skills partly with mentorship, partly other ways? Maybe just to start, what have you found to be the most important skills in your career that have most helped you advance in your career and other PMs around you?

Jules Walter (00:12:50):
In terms of skills, I think of it in terms of two buckets. One are IQ skills, intellectual skills, like what sometimes people call hard skills. And then the other things are the EQ skills, oftentimes called soft skills. What I've seen in my career is that early on, I leaned more into the hard skills, the IQ stuff. That was what was most helpful to me. And then later on, I spent more time getting better at the EQ skills. The reality with PMs is that within each of these buckets, there's so many skills and then you can feel overwhelmed, so my advice is really just start skill by skill. What I did specifically is I joined Slack, I was in ICPM. When you join a new company, especially if you're earlier in the mid-career, you really want to get good at things like execution, IQ skills, execution, product sense, strategy. So, those were critical for me, especially my first year at Slack. 

(00:13:51):
The other skill that I'll also call out, which nobody talks about for some reason, is interview skills, because so much of what gives you a chance to become better as a PM is working at a great company. How you get that job beyond networking is actually becoming good at interviewing. If you think about my career, getting into Slack changed my trajectory and I was able to do that because I got slightly somewhat good enough at interviewing. I barely got the job and then I was really good at execution and got better at these other things, product sense, strategy, et cetera. In that phase, the things that I was working on, as I mentioned earlier, were things like improving user activation. So, it relies on those skills: identifying the opportunities, running experiments, executing quickly, and so on. That's the first set of skills.

Lenny (00:14:49):
Before we move on, and the second set is EQ, right? Is that where you're going? 

Jules Walter (00:14:51):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:14:52):
Cool. Maybe just one quick thread I want to pull on is this interviewing skill. That's really interesting. Your point here is you're not... And I think you're going to get to this of just how to get better at these skills. You mentioned one of the best ways is to be surrounded by amazing people who can help you get better at these skills, but you won't get there if you can't actually get into a company like Slack. Is there something you've found to be useful in building these interview skills? When you say interview, it's being interviewed, not interviewing other people, like passing these interview tests. 

Jules Walter (00:15:22):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:15:22):
Yeah. I guess what have you found has been most helpful in helping you become a better interviewee?

Jules Walter (00:15:28):
When people tell me, "Hey, I'm going to a interview at this company." First question I ask is, "How many mock interviews have you done?" And the answer typically is zero. It's, "Oh, I read a bunch of stuff. I practiced in my head." But I'm like, "How many actual mock interviews have you done?" And I would recommend people to do dozens of those mock interviews. Now, the other thing about practice is it's always better if you deliberate practice. If you mock interview with somebody who's actually good at interviewing, then you'll get better faster. But even if you don't do that, just going from zero mocks to practicing in your head to actually doing mocks with peers and others is going to get you to another level. And then the other thing I'll say is interviewing can be quite traumatic and difficult for a lot of people, even me. I mean before I got this job, I interviewed at Google, I don't know how many times, over the last decade or two.

Lenny (00:16:22):
Wait. You're saying you're interviewed at Google many times and you didn't get in then you kept looking for new opportunities?

Jules Walter (00:16:27):
Yeah. I graduated from MIT and I think even since internship times in '07, I'd interviewed for roles at Google and I didn't get those roles or Meta or various other companies. It's because I wasn't good at interviewing and I didn't know people at those companies. By the way, most things you do, people give you some feedback so you can get better at it, but interviewing you never get any feedback. That's the thing people don't talk about, but it's actually an important skill or a barrier to underrepresented folks.

Lenny (00:17:01):
To actually get feedback?

Jules Walter (00:17:02):
Yeah. You won't get feedback after an interview at any company.

Lenny (00:17:05):
That's a really good insight of just people see you join a YouTube and are like, "Oh, yeah, of course he's going to get into YouTube." But you're saying that you actually tried to interview and get into Google many times and it took a number of attempts and advancing your career a little bit before you actually... So, don't feel so discouraged if it doesn't work out. 

Jules Walter (00:17:23):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:17:24):
In terms of this mock, that's a really important point of just actually doing the interviews, like practicing, practicing, practicing. Not just reading questions but actually testing and practicing interview. If you were interviewed at a big company, there's a lot of videos out there of like, "Here's the questions they ask. Here's what they look for." And you're saying find people that work at the company and do these sorts of interviews with them. For companies that are smaller that maybe don't... It's not as obvious what they're going to ask you. Do you have any advice on how to find someone to do a mock interview with or how or what to actually be talking through?

Jules Walter (00:17:56):
Yeah, it's hard at smaller companies. However, I think interviewing even at bigger companies will help you [inaudible 00:18:04]. A lot of the times the bigger companies have more rigorous processes. So if you can do well there, then it is a bit easier elsewhere. But the key is really that practice part, which people overlook.

Lenny (00:18:18):
Cool. Well, maybe one last question there and we'll move on. Do you have any favorite resources or just advice of where to go find the questions to mock interview with and then who do you look forward to do these interviews with, like just find someone at the company or one of these larger companies that you respect to mock interview with?

Jules Walter (00:18:34):
I mentor a bunch of people who talk about various communities that exist out there. I can follow up on those, but there are large communities of people prepping for these companies. The key is really just being a part of a community and doing the mocks. And then the last thing I'll say on this is interviewing is hard and especially, I think, hard for underrepresented folks because it's high pressure. It's high stress, high ambiguity-

Lenny (00:19:02):
So much stress.

Jules Walter (00:19:03):
... coming into a company. I've gone into companies like an interview and then the whole panel, nobody looks like me. I walk into the cafeteria, nobody looks like me. And then you are interviewing and you have all this self-talk about, "Hey, do I even want to work there? Will I belong," while you're trying to solve complex problems. So, that's also the other part companies don't think about. What I do, like folks at Black PMs that I coach, is really help them find groups of people, like small groups. Let's say three of us, et cetera, three to five, and then you practice with that group who are going through the process. And because you like the people, then it makes it a bit more fun and it also can help you prep for your own nerves in those interviews.

Lenny (00:19:48):
What I'm hearing is, and I know we hear this all the time, if you're, say, a Black product manager, it's so much harder to not just get in because there's potentially bias at the company, but you're just psychologically not feeling as comfortable because nobody looks like you. You're worried that they're going to have bias against you. Is that what you find?

Jules Walter (00:20:07):
Yeah, that has been my experience and it's also what I hear from a lot of people I mentor.

Lenny (00:20:13):
Your advice there, and this is helpful to anyone also, is just practice even more because that's probably the best way to get over that as much as you can.

Jules Walter (00:20:21):
Yeah. You want to basically practice so much that even at your worst, you're good enough. I've always felt like most interviews, I literally did my worst. It's just that it was good enough to pass. You're so stressed out, you don't relate to the person, et cetera.

Lenny (00:20:38):
Got it. Okay. Let's go back to the question I asked that I pushed us away from. We were talking about what skills as a PM you want to be focusing on that mostly will help you in your career, and we started with IQ. I wrote a couple notes, so there's the concrete skills, execution, products and strategy, interviewing, and then there's a second bucket of EQ.

Jules Walter (00:20:57):
So, the IQ I already talked about. Those are the skills that help me at, especially in my first year at Slack, drive big good experiments, design good product experiences, and then drive results. But then what happened is as I get promoted, managed people and then start having larger scope, then there's a lot of ambiguity and stress that comes in with that increase in scope. And that's where the EQ stuff shows up a lot, specifically things like communications, because it's no longer my team. It's like cross-functional partners, other teams, executives, so you have to communicate all the time to different people. And then the other thing is things like leadership. Now, I'm driving initiatives that involve multiple teams, basic company level OKRs, and then the other thing too is beyond leadership, which is managing your team as well. How do you be a good manager? How do you deal with the ambiguity, stress? How do you influence various people? 

(00:21:58):
These are the EQ skills. What I've seen is, number one, it's much harder to learn these skills than the IQ stuff. The IQ is very intellectual. Sometimes, you just need a mental model, practice a bit. The EQ, I'm still learning these things. It's just like every... I'm trying to get better. Then the other thing beyond it being hard to learn is that the EQ stuff... What you need to focus on is specific to you, so you learn it. You probably work on something different than what I would work on versus if we're both trying to be better at strategy or execution, there's a lot more overlap. So, there's a lot of self-awareness that you need to have to know even what to work on and then you need to continuously practice it.

Lenny (00:22:44):
What did you find was the most important EQ skill for your career that helped you in this journey?

Jules Walter (00:22:50):
I don't know if there is one that single-handedly was the most important. I had to develop on many of these things. I can tell you, for example, communication is something that is helpful, especially as I become more senior. What happened for me is, early in my career, it was more about clarity and then conciseness. Then later it became more about how do you tell a story, and then also how do you communicate in an empathetic way. Specifically, you're telling the same story or presentation but to different audiences, and each time you have to adjust it because the CEO will care about this part, the CFO will care about this other part, and so on. I think that's one area where I spend a lot of time. And then the other thing also that has been helpful is the self-awareness part that I mentioned, where through mentorship, especially mentors who were very honest and help me see my blind spots, I was able to see my own patterns.

(00:23:54):
When I'm under stress, for example, I tend to withdraw and not see anything. So, then you might think I'm disengaged. By the way, in an interview context you might be like, "Oh, does this person even want to work here?" Then once you know these patterns you know, "Okay, I'm stressed right now, but I need to say something so that people see that I'm actually interested in this problem; I'm just thinking through it. Well, let me verbalize my thought process." So, that's me as an example. For you, it might be the opposite. The self-awareness piece has been really helpful and it's something I continue to work on.

Lenny (00:24:26):
That's an interesting point that it's important to understand how you react and to figure out what's unique about you that you want to be working on, especially within EQ. For this example you gave about how stress impacts you, how did you actually discover that? Was that this mentor just pointing out, "Hey, Jules, I've noticed this happens," or is there anything else there that maybe folks would find useful?

Jules Walter (00:24:47):
Generally, you need someone to put a mirror in front of you irritably. Sometimes, it's like you hire a coach, I talk to, and they see patterns. I've done group coaching too. In this case specifically, he was a mentor. His name is Lawrence Ripsher. He was head of product at Pinterest and became a mentor and now a close friend. One day I was preparing for... I think I need to do a representation and he was like, "Hey, I've noticed that when you are thinking, you're just quiet. Let me tell you what's going on in my own head when I see that." And then he was like, "Hey, I'm telling myself that he's not interested in what we're doing." And I'm like, "Really? That's the least thing." And then I realized that's a pattern I have. Over time, through him and others, I've also observed other patterns.

Lenny (00:25:38):
I missed this, but was he a manager or just a mentor you had within the company?

Jules Walter (00:25:42):
We didn't work at the same company. When I was at Slack, he was head of product at Pinterest. We met at a dinner and then from there, over time, he became a mentor and then we started meeting. When I would hit difficult situations, sometimes I would call him and ask for advice, and then through those interactions he's helped me identify some of my blind spots.

Lenny (00:26:08):
Okay, awesome. We're definitely going to talk about mentorship and how to work with a mentor, but let's kind of wrap up this EQ piece. You mentioned within EQ, skills to think about working on communication, leadership, and management. Is there anything else and then is there an example of one of these skills and how, I don't know, it helped you in your career or held you back until you figure out how to work on this?

Jules Walter (00:26:30):
High level, I think those buckets are pretty broad: comms, leadership, management. Within each of them, there are various skills like setting vision, strategy, listening to learn, those sort of things. It's actually the type of things that Matt Mochary talked about when he came to speak at your podcast. I mentioned communications was one thing, right? What happened was, when I was at Slack, I was pretty good at writing, which by the way I was terrible at long time ago. It took me years, maybe decade, to get better at. But then when it was time to present... I was fine at presenting, but then if you ask me questions, things would crumble. That even happened to me once at an interview, where I did well presenting and then they asked me a question and then I just gave an answer that wasn't good. 

(00:27:22):
Then the self-awareness part helped me figure out what was going on. For me specifically, I realized whenever people ask me questions, if I didn't know the answer, I would have all this negative self-talk and I basically... You'd ask me a question and of course it could be something like, "Why are we doing it this way?" And it might come from a place of curiosity, you're just like, "Hey, I don't know. Can you tell me why you have more context," right? But in my head I would hear, "I don't agree with this." And that would be my self-talk. "Oh, this person doesn't agree with this," instead of being present and trying to understand where are they coming from and maybe asking follow-ups like, "Hey, thanks for asking the question. Is your concern more about, I don't know, scalability of this approach or is it more that you don't think it's effective even if it's not scalable?" 

(00:28:10):
You know what I mean? For someone else, it might be the easiest thing, but for me it took me months and months to, first of all, figure out that I had this pattern. And then once I figured out the pattern, it took also a while to now actually act on it so that now I'm comfortable. If you ask me a question, sometimes I don't know and I'll say, "Hey, let me get back to you." Sometimes I don't know and I'll say, "Hey, I don't know, but here's what I'm thinking." This little thing that may seem so obvious to you took me a while and different people have different versions of these blockers.

Lenny (00:28:45):

(00:29:54):
I love these stories and this is a good segue to start talking a bit about not just what skills to focus on, but how to actually get better at these things and identify these patterns in yourself. There's like a bunch of skills we just named, so let's also talk about where you think you start as you're starting off as a PM, which skills to focus on first, second, third. Let me just ask this broad question. We've talked about all these different skills PM should have. What have you found to be most effective broadly at building these skills in your career?

Jules Walter (00:30:24):
I will share my approach. It might not work for everyone and later when we talk about strengths and weaknesses. You might see why that works for me. What I do specifically is when I'm trying to learn something new, I try to think about what is an outcome that I could drive. And if I drive this outcome, it will be proof that I'm better at this thing. If we go back to this story of when I joined Slack, I didn't know anything, literally anything about growth. And I was telling myself, "I hope they don't fire me." But then the outcome I wanted is, within six months, I wanted to ship enough experiments that were successful, that drove activation by, let's say, X percent. So, that's very concrete. 

(00:31:06):
Then once I have this outcome, I work backwards to figure out how am I going to do that. One of the things we can talk about later when we talk about strength is that, for me, I'm really good at asking questions. What I do then is I start asking questions like, "Okay, I'm trying to drive activation for Slack. What are some frameworks that I should use to drive activation? What are best practices? What are examples?" I have a sense of the kind of question that, if I were to answer them, I'd be able to drive the outcome. And then what I do is I read a little bit, not a lot about the topic, just to make sure I'm asking the right question. Then I refine my questions and then I find the best people in the field and I just go talk to them. That's where we'll talk later about the mentorship part. 

(00:31:54):
In the case of activation, I was like, "Okay, what's the company that defined growth?" At the time, Facebook. "Who are the people that I can reach out to that do growth at Facebook?" And one of them was Bangaly Kaba and also Adriel Frederick who spoke at your podcast. I had met both of them at a random event. Then I'm like, "I need to find a way to have a chat with these folks and to help answer those questions with them." So, that's what I did with Bangaly in particular and also Adriel to a certain extent. I then learned, "Okay, here are frameworks to use for growth." For example, understand, identify, execute. Spend a lot more of your time understanding why people aren't staying on Slack versus anything else, so then I had pointers. 

(00:32:40):
Once I have the pointers, then I try to go through the thing. I'm like, "Okay, now let me..." I call the user researcher, "Hey, can we do a research on people who are signing up on Slack?" Data analysts, let's look at the data. What correlates with activation?" Those sort of things. Then after I go through a look, where I actually see results, whether they're good or bad, I go back to the mentor and I'm like, "Hey, I did this. It was actually successful. Thanks a lot." Now, I'm thinking about this other problem." I keep going and that's how I rinse and repeat, and over time I drive the outcome and I also know I'm getting better at this thing by working with the experts.

Lenny (00:33:18):
There's a few interesting takeaways there. One, is that you kind of create a forcing function for yourself to learn a thing. It's like, "Hey, I'm going to learn this thing. Let's create a goal that my ass is on the line to hit and then that's going to force me to go figure this out." And then two, it's interesting how often you come back to mentors and other people around you helping you out, which is a really good reminder. You don't have to figure things out for yourself; there's people out there that know these things and they're happy to help. A question I want to ask and I'll save this, because I we're going to talk about mentorship specifically a little bit later, just like how to find these people. Not everyone has access to Bangaly and Adriel, and I'm curious just how you found these folks, how you recommend other people find folks like that. But that's an awesome example. One tactic you're talking about here is just work backwards from a forcing function you've created for yourself to learn a thing. And in this case, what was it you were trying to learn? You were trying to learn growth, is that right?

Jules Walter (00:34:11):
Yeah, I was trying to learn growth and I wanted to do it in a context of activation, like new onboarding. And then later I also wanted to learn growth but in a different context, which was monetization. How do you drive revenue growth, not just get more users? And then later it was things like, "How do I learn how to create a growth org? How do I structure my team? How do I set work streams that add up to a coherent strategy?" And you just keep going

Lenny (00:34:42):
In those examples, did you do the same thing, you found people to talk to? 

Jules Walter (00:34:46):
Yeah. Yeah. It's the same approach. Sometimes what happens is I have a few mentors that I just keep going to over the years and it's just a top exchange and sometimes I sort of get new mentors who are experts at these new topics. It's a combination of those two things for me. And the thing is you obviously can learn without this approach, but this approach makes you, at least for me, makes me learn so much faster.

Lenny (00:35:14):
That's probably one of the most interesting things I've learned about mentors, and you're touching on this, that people want to help. They're happy to help if people come ask, unless they're just dumb questions or they're just overwhelmed. People are generally very happy to help. People are always worried like, "Why would they spend any time trying to help me with this random thing?" It's really the opposite; they're happy to help.

Jules Walter (00:35:34):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:35:35):
Coming back to the EQ and IQ buckets, are there other examples of ways you've learned to improve, say, strategy, execution, product sense, things like that?

Jules Walter (00:35:46):
Whether you have a mentor or not, there's other things you kind of have to do. For me, for example, one thing I do is I try to identify what's the best practice for something. For example, let's say strategy. There was a phase where I got feedback, "Hey you need to be better at strategy." Then I'm like, "Okay. Well, can you help me understand what are people at this company that was awhile back, where you think have done a great job at strategy or what are examples of artifacts?" Then I get these artifacts and I reverse engineering them. I try to think, "Okay, what are the top questions, the answer? Maybe I'm not answering all these questions. How do they do it?" And you start seeing the patterns like, "This person did it in a memo, this person did it in a deck." So, it's not about the format, but what is it about? Then this person had a lot of data, this person is quantitative, qualitative. So, that's a big part of what I do as well. It's true for all these things. 

(00:36:47):
For execution, it would be things like me attending another PMs meeting. "Oh, I heard this person is amazing at executing. Let me just see how they're on a meeting." And then you're like, "Whoa, things we didn't notice." Or somebody is great at communicating and I'm like, "Okay. Well, did you send this email? It's great. Let me save it." I'd have docs where I saved templates of things, and a lot of the reason, I think, people don't learn through osmosis that way is because one is you're not at a company where you can see great artifacts sometimes. That's why I mentioned if you can get a better company, do that. The other thing, too, is even if you see the greatness around you, some people don't try to break it down, to understand: "Why is this one great and not that one?" So, I actually do spend a lot of time every week reflecting like, "Oh, I saw these docs that were great or I saw this presentation this person gave." I sometimes crash presentation audits PMs give to executives, just to see how they handle questions or these sort of things. A lot of it is just spending time observing as well.

Lenny (00:37:54):
I love this advice, it's so powerful. Just like, "Who is amazing at this skill? And let me just go watch them and learn from them."

Jules Walter (00:38:01):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:38:02):
Something that you touched on here is, and I talk about this a bunch, that one of the benefits of working at a large company like Google, like Slack, is that you have access to a ton of real examples of strategy documents and vision documents and roadmaps and things like that, that once you're out of a company, like me, nobody shares these things publicly because they're sensitive. One of the best benefits of working at a large company is they have access to real life strategy documents, vision documents, things like that, so you should really savor that and collect them and, to your point, just study them. And I love your advice of just working backwards from like, "Okay, here's a strategy that work. What is it about the strategy that I can use when I'm building my strategy? What questions are they answering? How are they structuring it?" Things like that. That's awesome.

Jules Walter (00:38:48):
Similar to the mentor point, people are actually happy to talk to you. They're even flattered because no one else asked them. "Well, hey, I read your doc. Can we talk about it?"

Lenny (00:38:54):
Right. Whoever gets the... What PM ever gets someone coming to them? "I love your strategy doc. Tell me all about it. I'd love to talk about that."

Jules Walter (00:39:06):
Yeah. And then the other thing I'll say, too, is a lot of learning happens through the iterations and not by seeing the final product. We all see these products, like the iPhone and name your favorite product, but you don't know what versions they tried and sort of eliminated. And that's the benefit you also get at a company that has great product management. I actually sometimes tell the PM like, "Hey, don't just show me the one you just did. When are you going to do your next strategy? Can I join you then? I just want to sit and watch you write down the outline and just understand your thought process," or "I want to see when you're going to write your next exec update and understand how are you..." And you see them go through these iteration and you see them do things like get feedback that you didn't know they were getting all this feedback from. So, seeing the backstage is also really helpful.

Lenny (00:39:58):
It's interesting. Just as you're talking, I'm reflecting on how many benefits there are to working at a world class company. You are surrounded by really smart people who you can talk to and ask for advice and watch how they operate. You have access to really incredible documents and artifacts that you can learn from. Also, just the logo on your resume is really powerful for future job opportunities, which then comes back to the interview skills that you talked about and how important it is to be good at that to get into a company like that.

Jules Walter (00:40:24):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:40:25):
Interesting. Okay. What about on EQ? Any examples of how you learned some of those skills that you talked about communication or leadership or management or anything along those lines?

Jules Walter (00:40:36):
Yeah. On the communications side, I read some stuff like Minto's Pyramid Principles. Extremely helpful and I know you had an article on that. 

Lenny (00:40:44):
Mm-hmm.

Jules Walter (00:40:45):
I mentioned also that whenever I see a great email exec update or whatever, I literally save it in a special folder.

Lenny (00:40:54):
I love that.

Jules Walter (00:40:55):
Also, by the way, I always ask for feedback more than I think many people and I try to see patterns in feedback. For me, one thing I've observed is I tend to write long sentences, coming from a Haitian-French background, but then I see that because I've seen enough feedback that are about it so I see the patterns. Or as I mentioned earlier, I used to not be clear like, "Are you saying this solution or that solution?" It's better sometimes to be wrong but clear than the other way around. That's on the comms side. And then the other things, it's mostly, for me, through mentorship, people like Lawrence helping me be real with myself. I've had a coach for a while and I also do group coaching, which I really love. Right now I'm doing group coaching with a company called Pathways to Leadership.

(00:41:48):
These sort of things have helped me infer what my strengths and weaknesses are and then work on them. And then one thing I'll say also about the EQ: it was the most frustrating learning for me. For the IQ stuff, within six months, sometimes three months, I can see clear progress when you see enough documents. You see five, six of them, you start seeing 80% of the patterns. But then with the EQ stuff, it's things I've been working on for years. I am better at them, but I still feel like I'm continuing to work on those things. And a lot of it is like lifting weights or building muscles; you have to do it every day or every week. And then if you stop doing it, over time you atrophy again. That's something that people need to acknowledge, too. Give yourself time and then also learn these skills one at a time ideally.

Lenny (00:42:45):
Oh, interesting. Can you talk a bit more about that learning skills one at a time? Is your approach just like, "Here's the thing, I'm working on this the next six months. I'm going to focus on that."

Jules Walter (00:42:53):
Yeah. My approach is typically I'll say, "I'm giving myself, I don't know, three months, six months." It depends on what [inaudible 00:43:00] I want to see in my behavior for these things and then I just go all in on that skill. Let's say I wanted to learn strategy, I'll be like, "Okay, I'm giving myself, let's say, six months." Every week, I'm going to do something related to learning strategy. It's going to be maybe I read the strategy for another feature product at my company and you just divide, right? Let's just say there's 10 features or 20, it doesn't matter. You just do one a week, so 20 weeks. You see what I'm saying? And then the other thing is, every week I'm also going to practice it towards my outcome. I'm going to spend, I don't know, three hours a week, maybe one hour a day, just thinking through my own product strategy. And I do that for six months. You do it enough that you get over the hump and then actually develop the skill. Now, the other approach you could take is... What most people do is they read an article on your newsletter or some other place and then like, "Oh, great. I learned an insight." And then you go back to usual.

Lenny (00:44:00):
And it's not like at the end of these six months, you're done. I'm strategy expert, I am good on strategy. To your point, it's building this muscle that will never be fully built. It just will get stronger. And every time you invest time learning something, it gets stronger.

Jules Walter (00:44:15):
Yeah, exactly. It's not that within six months you are clearly better. Now, you can invest another six months to get to the next level. Or you could say, "Now I'm going to switch focus to another skill and get that one to a similar level."

Lenny (00:44:28):
Is there a skill you're working on right now?

Jules Walter (00:44:30):
Always working on something. One I can call out is listening. One thing about the EQ stuff, too, by the way is you hear these words, and depending on how familiar you are, you understand or don't understand what it actually means. When I say listening, I'm good at seeking information to solve a problem. If you come to me and you're like, "Hey, Jules, I have this problem," I will know what to listen for and what to ask you. "Hey, Lenny, can you tell me A, B?" And then I'll help you solve the problem. However, there's also different listening patterns, one of which is you just create space for someone. It's not like you're seeking a particular information, just give them space to tell you what they want to tell you. And then the other side of it, too, is you help that person feel heard, "Hey, I feel like you actually understand me and you've heard what I'm saying." So, that's the part I am working on.

Lenny (00:45:25):
You mentioned the Matt Mochary episode. I imagine you've been listening to that, because that has a lot of great advice.

Jules Walter (00:45:29):
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's those kinds of things, right? And then he talked about saying back to people what you heard, asking for more information, et cetera.

Lenny (00:45:38):
Awesome. You mentioned that you asked for feedback from your peers, and I wrote that down. I wanted to double-click on that a little bit. How do you actually approach asking for feedback? Do you sound like a survey? Do you just ask people in meeting? How do you do that?

Jules Walter (00:45:51):
The feedback piece, it's something that I had to get better at. Over time, I'm asking for it, because what I realize is if people don't feel comfortable with you, they won't give you feedback. It's depending on the risk, right? Especially if it's constructive feedback. By the way, that's also something that's hard about being underrepresented. People sometimes don't have the same natural level of connection with you. I basically learned to go out of my way to make people comfortable giving me feedback. There's different techniques and Matt Mochary also talks about some of them. Sometime it's basically ask in a very specific way, "Hey, I did this presentation. I'm working on, I don't know, having more executive presence. Did you feel that? To which extent did you feel that I showed executive presence?" So, it's a very specific thing versus, "Hey, how did it go?" That's one thing you can do. 

(00:46:45):
Other thing you can do sometimes is you give yourself critical feedback in front of them and then you give them a chance to agree or disagree. "Hey, I feel like this presentation didn't go well for this reason. What do you think? But actually I thought it would've been fine; however, this other thing could have been better." And then the other thing I'll say that is very, very important if you're asking people for feedback is if you manage to get them to take the risk to give you the feedback, your answer has to be enthusiastically grateful. That's the key. What people knew at Slack, Google, et cetera, is if you give me feedback, I'll be like, "Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful," because people are like, "Oh, he actually likes the feedback." Now, inside, my heart might be melting. I'm like, "Oh, I thought I got better at this." You know what I mean?

Lenny (00:46:45):
Yeah. 

Jules Walter (00:47:42):
But externally, I'm like, "Hey, thank you," and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't sort of focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.

Lenny (00:47:51):
That is such a good advice, all these very tactical ways of getting actual real feedback from people.

Jules Walter (00:47:55):
Yeah. And then one thing I'll say, too, by the way, it's harder to get feedback on the EQ stuff, and that's also why it's harder to develop and why a lot of people reach terminal levels in product, because people are like, "Oh, they lack emotional intelligence." They say that in calibration rooms but not in your face, so that's also what you want when you hear feedback. You don't want just to like, "Hey, here's my piece of feedback that I can prove." You also want the part that is like, "Here's how you make me feel or how you come across that... If this is taken out of context, it won't be good for... I don't want this to be shared publicly or taken out of context, but I want you to know." And it could be things like, "Hey, when I talk to you, sometimes I feel like, I don't know, you're angry." And then I'm like, "Oh, really? In what scenario?" And then it's like, "Oh, I was so focused and listening to you intently that I could see now why I come across that way." 

(00:48:55):
But you could literally go your whole career and then nobody ever says these things, right? And that's the kind of feedback that I personally find most helpful is the subjective feedback, because nobody will tell me those things. Once somebody I trust tell me and I'm like... Oh, here's an example. I mentioned earlier I'm good at asking questions. I had somebody ask like, "Tell me. Hey, sometimes when you ask questions, you sound more junior." And I was like, "Huh." And then I can see that because I asked the question plainly like, "Hey, why did you do this or how did you that," instead of also saying where I'm coming from, "Hey, I noticed this blah, blah, why, blah?" You know what I'm saying? Instead of showing I have an understanding of the thing and then asking a follow-up question, I just ask the question bluntly without context and people feel like, "Hey, I'm asking a very basic question." So, that's the kind of feedback that I particularly value.

Lenny (00:49:48):
The feedback you're getting is pretty incredible, like the stuff you shared about someone saying you come across as angry in a meeting if you ask questions or you sound a junior. I don't know if I've ever gotten anyone to give me that brutally honest feedback. When those specific cases, what was it about these people that helped them give you this feedback? Is that what you talked about, you built trust with them over the years or is there something you did to get that kind of feedback?

Jules Walter (00:50:10):
I mean, it's definitely they trusted me and they cared about me. They trust that if they tell me the feedback without translating, that I would see the intent behind it. And they were able to do that, because after months and years of working together, they know how to respond to feedback. Because what happens is most people, when you have to get feedback, you kind of have to really do a lot of translation work so that it lands, "I don't want to hurt your feeling. I don't want you to take this." I just told people, "You don't have to that with me." That's one. And then the other thing, too, is people reciprocate also how you talk. I'm not saying I talk to people like this, but I try to be vulnerable with people so they know we can be vulnerable and things are safe like, "I really want to hear things the way you experience it."

Lenny (00:50:59):
Got it. So, there's a lot of foundation setting that you do to create this environment where people are like, "Jules, here's something that's going wrong. You can work on this." 

Jules Walter (00:51:05):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:51:06):
That's an awesome takeaway. One other thread I wanted to pull on is you mentioned focusing on strengths and how that ends up being really important. Something I'm a big believer in is focusing on strengths versus trying to make your weaknesses much, much stronger. Is there any advice you can share to better understand what your strengths are, why that's an approach to take in developing your skills?

Jules Walter (00:51:28):
For the strengths, breakthroughs. For me, a lot of it was talking to my mentor, Lawrence Ripsher. And I organized this event for Black PMs at Pinterest, where Lawrence was speaking, and then we were talking about, "Hey, watch should we talk about, et cetera." I don't know how, but in the conversation he talked about doubling down your strengths more than on fixing your weaknesses, and then he used me as an example. Then the fun part is he had this approach of how you actually find your strength. It's a very simple question, where basically he's like, "Hey, what is something that a lot of people say you're good at, but you think it's not a big deal or it's not that important?" And that's the key. I always that's what resonated with me. I was like, "Oh, a lot of people keep saying I'm really good at networking."

(00:52:26):
I'm like semi-introvert, so I'm like, "Hold on, I don't know." [inaudible 00:52:32] not everyone or people will tell me, "Hey, you have asked great questions." And I'm like, "I asked basic questions." And then he helped me understand, "Actually, that's how you know it's a strength." Now, what you need to figure out is how do you get more out of that strength. An analogy, by the way, is imagine that you saw a fish and you were like, "Hey, you're really good at swimming." And then the fish would be like, "Oh. Duh, doesn't everybody swim?" And so, that's the key and I invite people to think about that question like, "What's something people keep telling you you're good at, but you yourself don't think is a big deal?" And that's how I was able to find a bunch of my strengths. ]

(00:53:09):
For me, generally I'm thoughtful, ask great questions. I also simplify problems a lot. I mean, we work together on a product sense article, which is a very complex thing, made it more simple. And then once you identify the strength, then it helps to also think about why are you good at this thing? Because that's the underlying resource that you have. A big part for me is I'm actually quite curious. And fun fact, I don't think of myself as curious, but people keep telling me I am. And even my mom was telling me when I was a kid, I used to always try to unscrew toys to see how they work in the inside. That's one thing: being curious help me ask the questions and so on. And then the other thing, too, is once you have the strength, you want to understand the shadow side of it, and that's the connection between your strength and weaknesses.

(00:54:02):
That was a key breakthrough for me, especially Lawrence helped me understand that. Strengthen and weakness, it's not a binary thing. It's like the same thing, but it's a dial. In some context it's good, in other contexts it's serving you. An example in my cases is... I talked about I ask great questions, but sometimes I ask a question without context, I might come across as less knowledgeable. Or another thing for me is I'm able to take very complex problems and then create a mental model that's much simpler, whether it's growth or other things. But until I come up with that mental model, if I'm in a meeting with you, I won't talk much about that topic. Basically, I'm more quiet than other people when people want to hear my point of view because I'm just listening and trying to create a mental model of the situation. You're seeing how the same strength is perceived as a weakness depending on context. And once you have that... For me, I feel more empowered. I'm like, "Oh, I just have to dial down a little bit here or dial a little bit here," and I also know this thing is serving me, which is why I keep doing the bad side of it.

Lenny (00:55:10):
Awesome. This all often comes back to mentors in your life. I want to get to talking about mentorship and how you find your mentors, how you work with them, all that kind of stuff; something we've been touching on a bunch and I'm excited to begin to. Maybe to start, can you just talk about some of the mentors you've had in your life, some of the most impactful mentors that you've had?

Jules Walter (00:55:35):
I've definitely had a large number of mentors over the years. Fun fact, when I came to the area eight years ago, I didn't know anyone.

Lenny (00:55:42):
Wow.

Jules Walter (00:55:43):
It took a while to build those relationships. I talked earlier about Bangaly Kaba who sort of helped me figure out how to grow Slack even though he wasn't working outside, but helped me have the frameworks. I talked about Lawrence Ripsher. He helped me discover my strengths and also how to lean into them. Aaron Teague is another friend and mentor who brought me to Google, actually. And there's also Bradley Horowitz, former VP of Google Photos, also helped me in terms of how do you think about leadership and so on. Many other folks, Nikhyl Singhal, VP at Meta helped me with PM career. So, lots of mentors for sure.

Lenny (00:56:23):
Okay, that's the killer list. Two questions. One, what do you look for in a mentor when you're trying to find someone to work with? And then two, how do you actually find these people? Most people listening are like, "Wow, I would love an amazing mentor to help me in my career. I don't know how to find one." What advice do you have for folks to finding a mentor?

Jules Walter (00:56:41):
I look for two things. One is, are you good at one specific thing I'm trying to get better at? And then two is, are you good at explaining it? Those two, at least for me, they're important. I know people are really good at their roles, at their job and at the subject, but they don't actually know how they do it or they don't really want to explain or cannot explain easily. So, that's what I look for. And then in terms of where I find these people, it's really everywhere. If you look at the list I mentioned earlier, Bangaly I met at an event. Facebook had a recruiting event, I showed up, I see this guy, I'm like, "Oh. Hi." Chat a little bit. I talked about Lawrence, who's now a close friend. I met Lawrence at a dinner. He organized a dinner for underrepresented PMs, we chatted, one thing led to the other, and then he became a mentor and friend. Bradley was at a fundraiser. And Nikhyl was an intro via email. Somebody was like, "Oh, you should meet Nikhyl." 

(00:57:41):
I know this sounds counterintuitive. I don't think the hard part is where to find them; it's more about finding the right person and then how do you get a foot in? Now, what I've seen... A lot of people, sometimes they get mentors who are too senior or who don't actually think about the topic they're interested in. Maybe they did five years ago, but once you find the right person, the key is like, "How do you have that initial conversation? How do you get the foot in the door?" And what I've found is you should make the smallest ask possible, which is the opposite of what 95% of people do. 95% of people is like, "Hey, I've never met you, but I heard your talk or I saw you on LinkedIn or whatever. Can we set up a call?"

(00:58:29):
That's like a big ask. What I do... For example, there's this person who came to Slack, he was head of product of a major company and then he gave a talk about different methods to improve products. He had this concept of finding the heat for products. He spoke at the company, I got his email, and I reached out in the evening and I was like, "Hey, thanks so much for speaking today. We talked about finding the heat for products. Is there an example of product that you think was created with this approach?" Something he could answer in literally two minutes via email? That was my question. It wasn't like, "Hey, you talked. Now, I feel entitled to meet with you." But then the key is once you get that foot in the door, it could be a quick email, a tweet, a quick chat at an event, that sort of thing, and you get some advice that's useful, the key is to circle back with them at a later point and show that you've actually made good use of the advice. 

(00:59:30):
I think that's the thing nobody does. What I would do... For example, there's currently the CEO of a top tech company I met an event. She spoke there and then she gave some advice that was useful. I emailed her a follow-up type thing and then she gave me advice about how to rethink the mission statement for my nonprofit, all via email. Then at some point I was like, "Hey, I've applied your problem trend competency framework to crafting the mission for my nonprofit. Here's where we landed. That was super helpful. Thank you so much." Replies back. And then what I would do then later is maybe a month later or two months, X months later, I can reach out again for another problem and maybe I could say, "Hey, this time it's a little bit more nuanced. Can we grab 15 minutes?" And the person was like, "Yeah, sure." That person was very, very busy. I was like, "Hey, let's do it." And then over time we become Facebook friends, that sort of thing, but that's the approach I take.

Lenny (01:00:29):
That's such a good advice. It reminds me of Tim Ferris's advice also, which is just like, "Don't go up to someone and be like, 'Will you be my mentor?'" Everyone's going to be like, "I don't have time for that." Instead, to your point, it's the exact opposite. Just start asking simple questions and then over time build up relationship, and then over time, maybe you start meeting regularly. But don't start big; start small.

Jules Walter (01:00:50):
You. As small as possible.

Lenny (01:00:53):
It's not like you just have one mentor. You've listed a whole bunch of people that have helped you over your career. It's not like, "Here's the person, they have to be perfect." It sounds like you kind of identify, "Here's a skill or an area I want to focus and this person is going to be really good at that." 

Jules Walter (01:01:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:07):
Then I also just love the point about it feels really hard to find an amazing mentor. From what I'm hearing, the main thing you do is just go to things, attend events, basically go events, meet people, right? That's kind of the foundation in which you're sharing is just meet as many people as you can, and amongst that group, you'll find people that are probably going to be helpful.

Jules Walter (01:01:26):
Yeah. And I understand it can be harder for some folks. I mean, now I have two young kids, so I don't do as many events. I've also met quite a few people through introductions, sometimes being cold outreach. I had a chat with Shishir through cold outreach [inaudible 01:01:44] a very clear question, and then he offered to come to Black PMs and share some insights. Those kinds of things happen, too, but you have to show the person that you're going to make really good use of their time. You have to give really specific contexts like, "Hey, let's grab coffee." It's like, "Hey, here's a very specific question. Can you share some thoughts or point via email?" And then they might offer, "Hey, why don't we just talk?" That sort of thing, too. Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:09):
That works really well. Anytime I get an email request of, "Hey, could we do a 15-minute Zoom or a copy chat," I quickly do not have time for that. But an actual question that I can be really helpful with really quickly, that's so much easier, so that makes a lot of sense. The next thing I wanted to ask you is: how do you build and continue this relationship? And then once you actually start engaging regularly, what do you suggest folks talk about in these meetings if they're ongoing.

Jules Walter (01:02:37):
I make sure to bring something very specific that I'm dealing with where they can provide input. And this is the opposite of what many people do where they're like, "Hey, can you tell me about how you... Whatever, your path to PM," which may or may not be relevant to them, versus, "Hey, I've interviewed for three companies. I'm trying to decide among those three. Can I walk you through my thought process and get your feedback?" So, it's very different. I definitely make sure I bring a very specific context, and sometime it could be... I mentioned the example of Bangali like, "Hey, I'm now a growth PM at Slack. I'm trying to improve activation. Can I talk to you about how you approach growth in general?" Or it could be, "Hey, I'm having internal..." Let's say I have internal mentors at Google and I have a few, then it's like, "Hey, I'm about to have this negotiation with this team. Can I walk you through my thought process and hear your advice?" So, it's very specific things. 

(01:03:37):
And then the other thing I'll say, too, is when I talk to mentors, I always take notes. I mean, I'm seeing you even here in this interview. You're taking notes. These are basic things people don't actually think about it sometimes. And then when I follow up, whether it's via email or in person, I bring up older conversations. It's like, "Hey, remember last time we told about X? I did it," or "Hey, how's your daughter? I know she was going to college this semester. How did that go?" So, it always feels like a continuation of a conversation and it feels like an actual relationship instead of transactional interactions. And then the other thing, too, is I try really hard to identify ways that I can be helpful. Sometimes, at the end of chat I'll be like, "Hey, is there anything I can help you with? Anything top of mind for you?" And sometimes the person could be senior or wealthy, doesn't matter, and they're like, "Actually, yes. I'd love to better understand how the team is really doing. Nobody will tell me the truth," or "Hey, I am trying to hire for this role. You have [inaudible 01:04:43] Black PMs. Do you mind sharing?" There's always ways you can help, but most people are so focused on themselves that they miss out on these opportunities.

Lenny (01:04:52):
The point about coming back to the person and sharing what impact their advice had and how it went is so good, because to your point, it just feels like you're sharing all this advice and just isn't going anywhere. And then note-taking, such great stuff. This is really good advice. I could see how it would work on me if someone's asking me for advice.

Jules Walter (01:05:10):
By the way, I mean we didn't know each other two years ago, right?

Lenny (01:05:10):
Yeah, that's right.

Jules Walter (01:05:14):
Yeah. It's like a similar process, where we got to know each other mostly via email and led to the other, and we try to help each other.

Lenny (01:05:22):
And look at us now. Any final thoughts before we wrap up and head to our very exciting lightning round?

Jules Walter (01:05:31):
I have found the process of learning how to be a PM very difficult and I also find it quite rewarding. And I want to set expectation, especially for people who are early in their career, people may be frustrated by the process, because you have all these skills. We listed, I don't know, half a dozen, a dozen that you want to get better at. So, be patient. Then also it takes a while to see massive differences, but once you see those differences, you set yourself apart from your peers. That's one thing. And then the other thing, too, is it's really building muscles more so for the EQ stuff, but even for the IQ stuff. You have to practice. It's not just read Lenny's top 10 articles for two hours and then you're good. Read them, do what they say, get feedback after you do what they say and say like, "Huh, it worked for me. It didn't work for me." Reread them again, find mentors, et cetera. It's a long process and I don't think people have that mental model around how to learn in general, but also specifically how to learn the PM skills.

Lenny (01:06:41):
And I imagine there's also this one step forward, two step back experience that often happens, too, where you're just like, "Oh, I thought I figured out how to think about strategy, and this one failed." And you're like, "Oh, that was useless." No, this is how you learn. You fail sometimes. Oftentimes, it works out slowly but surely you move forward.

Jules Walter (01:06:57):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (01:06:58):
Amazing. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Since we've gone a little long, I'm going to keep it just four questions. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast, whatever comes to mind. Fire off. You ready? 

Jules Walter (01:07:10):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:07:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jules Walter (01:07:15):
One of them is Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss. It's about negotiations. There's actually also a masterclass on it.

Lenny (01:07:21):
I was just going to say that. I watched that. That was really good. 

Jules Walter (01:07:24):
Yeah. Yeah. And then another one is Connect by Carole Robin. It's inspired by Stanford's Touchy-Feely class, if you've ever heard of it.

Lenny (01:07:33):
Yeah. She did a guest post for the newsletter, actually.

Jules Walter (01:07:35):
Oh, really? Awesome. Yeah. It's really a helpful especially as you are thinking about the EQ skills and how to improve your relationships with people.

Lenny (01:07:44):
Awesome. I highly recommend that book. I haven't read it, but I read a lot of things about the class and my friends have been in that class and she wrote this guest post. That sounds like a really good pick for EQ, so I'm actually going to re-pick it up. Next question: favorite other podcast that isn't this podcast.

Jules Walter (01:08:02):
Lex Fridman is one I'll call out. Brings really interesting speakers and also on diverse topics, so I find it really helpful.

Lenny (01:08:11):
Awesome. I also love that podcast. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jules Walter (01:08:15):
I watch fewer now. Top Gun: Maverick is a movie I really like. I'm sure many people have seen it. For me, it's like just going back in the 80s. And then TV show is Never Have I Ever. It's coming of age in America, Indian teenager. Pretty funny and also deep.

Lenny (01:08:34):
Awesome. I haven't heard of that one. We'll check it out. Final question: favorite interview question that you like to ask folks when you're interviewing them?

Jules Walter (01:08:41):
One I used to ask a lot is: what's something work related that you're trying to get better at? Sometimes I change the wording of it, but a big part of it is trying to understand how self-aware people are, to which extent they have a growth mindset, and then also how honest and vulnerable they can be. What I will say, though, about interview question, by the way, is I don't anchor a lot on the first question. What I find the most value from are the follow-ups. Once you ask that question, you can take in various directions like, "Why did you focus on this versus other things? How did this come to your attention? Was it feedback you sought or feedback people gave you, et cetera?" Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:24):
Awesome advice. Jules, this interview was a longtime coming. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you? 

Jules Walter (01:09:39):
In terms of finding me, Twitter is one place to start. My handle is @julesdwalt. And then in terms of how people can be useful, it's really about paying it forward and then sharing this with others, especially parts that people find useful.

Lenny (01:09:55):
Amazing. Jules, thank you so much. We'll chat again soon.

Jules Walter (01:10:00):
Yeah, thanks for having me.

# M&A, competition, pricing, and investing | Julia Schottenstein (dbt Labs)

## Transcript

Julia Schottenstein (00:00:00):
M&A is always about creating plan Bs. And the way I would think about it is for any one company, there's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic. And the strategy that I would do in how do you get noticed is I would figure out the area that you bring a competitive advantage. And I would inflict pain on that potential buyer. Make it impossible for them to not notice you because that's when they're going to have their ears perk up and say, "Well, what's going on with this company?"

(00:00:33):
The really important piece here is you want to do that in a way that's still friendly and open. I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely will shut down a conversation or they won't talk to an incumbent or a potential future buyer because they take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs and you don't want to shut that door down prematurely because you don't know if you can really go the distance and be an independent company. So you want to have optionality.

Lenny (00:01:04):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Julia Schottenstein. Julia is a product leader at dbt Labs where she leads the dbt Cloud product. She's also the co-host of the dbt Labs podcast called Analytics Engineering Podcast, a show about data trends that impact analytics engineers work. As you'll hear in this episode, Julia actually led the acquisition of a startup that I'm an investor in called Transform from the side of dbt Labs.

(00:01:37):
And in our conversation, we dig into the M&A process and get into a bunch of advice for how to improve your odds of having a good outcome and just approaching M&A broadly. We also dig into the story of dbt, which is one of the most successful startups out there that you probably don't know about. And we talked about what they did right to get to where they are now. We also cover how to best think about competition, a bunch of frameworks for thinking about product and advice on how to approach pricing and also open source. Enjoy this episode with Julia Schottenstein after a short word from our sponsors.

Julia, welcome to the podcast.

Julia Schottenstein (00:04:17):
Super excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:19):
So you have a really interesting career path in that you went from VC into product management. Usually it's the other way around. Usually PMs become VCs and it's right to see this version of it. So I wanted to start with just a question of just how did that come to be?

Julia Schottenstein (00:04:34):
I do have an unusual background, but it doesn't surprise me that people who are interested in product are also interested in investing and vice versa. For me, I've always had three interests broadly and that's an interest in business, an interest in technology and an interest in markets. And I get to express those interests both in investing and in product, but just with different weights. So in product you go a lot deeper on the tech and markets is less of a focus, but you still get to do all three. So I have a unusual background and I used to be a professional investor at NEA. Spent all my time investing in early stage startups that built for technical audiences. So think dev tools, infra data companies.

(00:05:22):
And in 2019 I first discovered dbt, which was an open source data transformation framework. And I got really very, very excited about dbt because when I talked to people that were using it, the way that they described their experience on dbt was like unlike anything I had heard before. It was much more of an identity for them than just a tool that they were using to get their job done. And that really struck me. And as I thought about what was happening in the market, there was a lot going on in 2019. The markets were changing quite a bit. Cloud data warehouses were starting to explode. This was the year where Snowflake went from a 4 billion company to a 12 billion company. And I thought to myself, if dbt worked, it could work in a really extraordinary way. And I naturally tried to spend all my time getting close to Tristan, who's the CEO and founder and I wanted to invest.

Lenny (00:06:24):
Okay. So at this point you're a spec at NEA, you're trying to invest in dbt and okay, keep going.

Julia Schottenstein (00:06:29):
Yeah. So I was very, very excited. I thought if this worked, it could work in a really extraordinary way and I spent all my time trying to get Tristan to like me so that I could invest in the company. And then in 2020, I finally got the call that I was waiting for. Tristan said, "We're going to raise some money." He had a term sheet from a firm that he liked. It was a good venture fund, but he also liked me and he wanted to give me a shot and I was super excited to get that message because this is my chance. And unfortunately I ended up losing that deal to Sequoia. It's a formidable partner.

Lenny (00:07:04):
Reasonable loss.

Julia Schottenstein (00:07:05):
I was just so convicted that if was going to be a special company that I asked to even put my personal money in and I asked to put a very irresponsible, irrational amount, nearly like 20% of my liquid net worth into dbt because I was so convinced that this was special. And sometimes when deals don't work out as an investor, you can create this narrative in your head like, "Good, I dodged a bullet or better off without them or screw them." But for me that was quite the opposite with dbt. I really felt like dbt was this runaway train and it was special and I wanted to jump on board. So a few months later I ended up calling Tristan and asked him if I could be a part of the company that built the product that I thought was so special. So that was my unique path into product and to dbt.

Lenny (00:08:02):
So you invested in dbt and then an opportunity opened up where you ended up working there?

Julia Schottenstein (00:08:08):
No, I think if I was able to invest I wouldn't be here. So I got no, the board ended up vetoing my personal investment, but it's okay because I ended up dedicating all of my personal time to building the company.

Lenny (00:08:23):
Awesome. Okay. So something you touched on there that was really interesting of what you saw about dbt that was so interesting and I think this is maybe a broader question of just in your time investing and finding a company like dbt early, what have you learned about just picking well, finding companies early especially? What are signs in your experience of just that this is going to be something really interesting that you might want to join? And this is more for people listening that are thinking about joining a company early on. What do you think they should look for?

Julia Schottenstein (00:08:52):
So the way I would look at joining an early stage company would be the same way I would evaluate investing in one. So there are four things that I care about when I'm looking at really early stage companies and it's people, market, product and distribution. And I'll touch on each of those four to say a little bit more about what specifically I'm looking at. So people, this is really the CEO, the founder of the company put simply do you trust this person to lead. And for me, Tristan had this really rare ability to paint a very compelling future of the industry and how dbt was going to be a part of making that vision a reality. But he also was really, really detailed in the day-to-day work of the analytics engineering work. And it was that range in scale that made me feel like this is a founder that's very rare and compelling.

(00:09:42):
The next is markets. We touched on it a little bit, but what I'm looking for in markets it's like is it growing? Is there space for new entrant to make its mark? And when it came to dbt, it was an explosive time in cloud data warehouses and it was that chaos that was really the opportunity for dbt because they created some orderliness and structure to the way that people worked with their data in the cloud data warehouse. So that was very compelling. The next is product. Everyone who's listening hopefully either is interested in products or has a product background. So I won't say too much there, but can you talk to users or potential customers, are they building something that's really special, unique? Can you hear that, spark that enthusiasm and figure out if this is going to be special.

(00:10:31):
And then the last, I think this is more important arguably than if they have a good product but is distribution, do they have an advantage on how are they going to get to market because that's really, really hard? And think about how they think about their competitive advantage on either the ecosystem or distribution and how they're going to ultimately sell the product. You're not going to get a 10 out of 10 on all four dimensions. So when you're joining a company, you also have the benefit of dedicating your time. So try to think if they're weaker on one dimension, what is it that you bring to the table or what are you special at that could potentially de-risk the success of the company

Lenny (00:11:11):
In terms of spark with a product. Right now on product market fit, now how do you know if you have product market fit? And a lot of it often comes down to there's a emotional reaction from someone you're talking to about the product you're building. There's like, "Holy shit, I want this now." Is there anything even more specific you've seen of just what is a sign that this, there's a spark that people are just really enthused? You talked about people made dbt part of their identity. Is there anything else there?

Julia Schottenstein (00:11:36):
Yeah. It's can they not stop talking about it and that's the chatter about a product, they want to share it with their teammates or to other people at different companies. That just top of mind love and wanting to share what they've found with others is really a great sign that you're onto something. And then that spark will help do a lot of the work on how do you get to market because your evangelists are really your users of people that love what you're building.

Lenny (00:12:06):
What about in terms of the distribution bucket? What are some examples of just really important, I don't know, unique or effective distribution strategies or I don't know, unfair advantages you've seen maybe with dbt, maybe other companies? What are some examples of that?

Julia Schottenstein (00:12:20):
So dbt had an ecosystem advantage and they were open source and this helped really dramatically for lots of people to have low barrier friction to just try it out and spread organically. They first got started with very horizontal. People could just get started without ever even talking to sales and think that was a competitive advantage. But not all companies need to be product led. Some companies are enterprise top-down sales. So in those situations think about does the team really know how to land a complex enterprise sale? Do they have a background in that particular space? Do they have a network of connections? Can be different depending on what the company is selling, but you either want to see a company that's really strong at enterprise or really strong at the bottoms up.

Lenny (00:13:11):
Okay, cool. So I want to shift a bit to talking about an area that you have a lot of experience in which a lot of people are also really interested in right now, which is M&A. I've invested in a lot of companies and maybe, I don't know, once a month I'm getting an email from a startup I've been investor in. There's just like, we're looking at maybe selling the company, things aren't working out the way we were hoping. And you've been on I think maybe all sides of the table of M&A transactions, including I think you led the acquisition of a company... I was an investor in the dbt acquired that I think is public company called Transform. So my question is just for founders who are currently thinking about M&A meaning acquisition essentially. What's your best advice for them for how to be most successful in M&A outcome for themselves?

Julia Schottenstein (00:13:57):
When it comes to acquisitions, the time to start thinking about an M&A strategy is hopefully when you don't need one. And the best strategy that I could give a founder is to have a really strong offense in building their company. And when founders start their businesses, they don't usually set out to start a company to sell it to another business. They start it to be an enduring independent standalone company. And if you have that path, then you'll have the upper hand in absolutely every single M&A conversation because you have a viable alternative, which is do nothing, stay the course, you don't have to sell. But of course that's not the case for most companies. Most companies don't have a viable path to being an independent company forever. So they have to think about M&A. So M&A is always about creating plan Bs.

(00:14:49):
And the way I would think about it is for any one company, there's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic. And the strategy that I would do and how do you get noticed is I would figure out the area that you bring a competitive advantage and I would inflict pain on that potential buyer. Make it impossible for them to not notice you because that's when they're going to have their ears perk up and say, "Well, what's going on with this company?" We just bought this company Transform. They are playing a really good playbook here.

(00:15:25):
And the really important piece here is you want to do that in a way that's still friendly and open. I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely will shut down a conversation or they won't talk to an incumbent or a potential future buyer because they take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs and you don't want to shut that door down prematurely because you don't know if you can really go the distance and be an independent company. So you want to have optionality.

Lenny (00:15:54):
I love this term with pain on your potential acquirers. What are some examples of that? Who's done that well or what's an example of that interaction?

Julia Schottenstein (00:16:03):
Yeah. I mean I can share the transform stories of a company we just acquired, we announced it in February. So dbt Labs, we build transformations, that's our main product. And we were venturing into a new product area that we call the semantic layer. And to describe what that is quickly, it's allowing companies to define their business metrics and so that whenever anyone queries it, we always serve back consistent data on those business metrics and transform. They were a pure play company only in this metrics layer, semantic layer. And they had a really strong product.

(00:16:41):
They had figured out some of the technical challenges and they had solved it early on. They had the benefit of having worked at Airbnb, which and Airbnb in the data world is famous for having a really successful semantic layer metrics layer called Minerva. And what we had at dbt Labs is really good distribution and ecosystem, but we were a little behind in bringing a product to market and we felt that pressure from Transform because they were doing such a great job at being vocal and loud about how their semantic layer solves these really hard technical problems.

(00:17:20):
But they didn't have any distribution. So that was really tough for them and they were putting pressure, but they were still positioning their company as a partner to us because they wanted our community to be excited about what they were building and hopefully lure them over to use their product. So because they had positioned themselves as a friendly partner when really we were trying to compete for this similar use case, when it came time to do an acquisition, we were really excited because we knew their product was good and they had already done a lot of the work to make integrating with dbt possible and that helps us post acquisition do the integration much more easily.

Lenny (00:18:01):
How do you just think about either as a startup or even an incumbent about how to think about competition, how much emphasis, how much energy to put into thinking what competitors are doing and just how that informs your strategy?

Julia Schottenstein (00:18:15):
So we recently codified our philosophy when it comes to competition. And I'll give Nick Handel the founder of Transform who led this exercise at dbt Labs. But we really have three pillars when it comes to competition. So the first is hold true to our vision. We're really excited about the path and the journey that we're going on at dbt Labs and we don't want the distraction. So occasionally you'll have competitors maybe throw shade or throw stones, but most of that is just noise. If you have a lot of conviction that you're going in the right journey, you want to just keep your eyes straight ahead and run your best race and not be too distracted by what maybe some critics are saying.

(00:19:00):
The second philosophy we have is really a grow the pie philosophy. So we want to work with our partners in our ecosystem to make the opportunity set even larger and we see that today. We mostly serve reporting and BI use cases, we're seeing lots of companies start to operationalize their data. Now with this big wave of ML, clean Transform data assets are being used to train machine learning models so that the pie continues to grow. Let's focus on that as our target and work with people to make the opportunity set really attractive and not try to slice it up too thinly.

(00:19:37):
And then the last one is we want to lean into our strengths. So we have an ambition to be a platform company and we know what we're good at, but we also want to leave space for our ecosystem to offer solutions to our users that help them out. And we really want to foster an ecosystem where we can partner with lots of companies in the modern data stack. And generally speaking, when it comes to competition, we take a really long-term view and there are a few areas that we do want to hold our ground and that's in our transformation standard as well as our semantic standard because we believe those two are better served together for the user's sake. But for everything else, we really feel like we can work with our ecosystem and accomplish what we want to accomplish and also help them accomplish their goals too.

Lenny (00:20:27):
This might be a good time to just chat about dbt and the success the company has had. So many startups have tried to become a standard default layer of what's now called the modern data stack. And I don't know any startup doesn't use dbt or planning to use dbt. It's just a incredibly rare success story somewhere to snowflake where it's just like it's the default for building large data startups and most startups these days work with a lot of data. So my question is just like what do you think dbt did most right to win in this and continue to win?

Julia Schottenstein (00:21:01):
So I think dbt did a lot of things right, but I'll point out too that really stick out to me. And the first is just power and simplicity and the second is a commitment to being open. And I'll touch on what I mean by those two things. So when dbt was first getting started, you would hear a lot from companies, I don't understand, what's so special about dbt? We have a SQL templating tool at our company, we built one in-house. Like this is really straightforward and simple and it's true like dbt is really simple, but that is the power of it.

(00:21:37):
So our founders, Tristan, Drew and Connor, they had a belief that the people who do data analysis work, that really work closely with their business stakeholders should also be the ones to contribute to creating clean data assets in production because that data prep work is a necessary prerequisite for any analysis that you do. So dbt was really this belief that if you know SQL, we want to invite you to do these workflows that were traditionally held by data engineers but you had to earn that. So dbt has this nice framework where it's harder to mess up, keeps data quality really high, but it is pretty simple to get started and learn and learn. And that was really the unlock in the industry. We were definitely solving a pain point at the right time.

(00:22:26):
And then the second thing is this commitment to being open. So dbt is open source and that's the main guts of dbt where you write your business logic and it helps in a number of ways. Specifically it helps with flywheel, keep the flywheel running and also with network effects. And I'll explain what that looks like. So dbt is really easy to get started with at your company with reduced friction. We're building a product that people, so they talk about it, they want to share it both at their organization and with other companies. Other companies get started with dbt again with reduced friction.

(00:23:05):
We now get to see this really diverse set of use cases for dbt across company sizes, across industries and it allows us to build a truly horizontal company. As our company grows, we get to invest back into our community and our product and the flywheel begins to spin faster. And then meanwhile we have a really large user base. So we have 20,000 companies using dbt every single week and that attracts partners to want to build for dbt and so they share best practices, build workflows, and now if you're a company and you've standardized on dbt, you've really unlocked an integrated modern data ecosystem that wasn't available for you before. So that has a flywheel and also benefits everyone that decides to be on the standard. So it's those two really important trends that made dbt so powerful today.

Lenny (00:24:02):
So what I'm hearing there is essentially the product was right for what people needed to solve. There's also a product led component, open source, free self-serve piece that people adopted, used and started working and then scaled and started paying for it. And then there's an alignment of the vision of where this was going and how it fit with how people wanted this to work for them. Is there anything else? Because a lot of startups do that and that all sounds really smart and good, but a lot of startups try to do those things and no one cares. Maybe their product isn't necessarily what people are looking for, maybe they don't get the right distribution. I don't know. Is there anything else that you think they did really well that helped them kickstart this to even be a thing? Is it timing that was really great? Is it specific influencers early on?

Julia Schottenstein (00:24:48):
Yeah. I think timing was really important with the success of dbt. That they were there when the cloud data warehouses were really exploding and growing in an enormous way. And dbt Labs started as Fishtown Analytics, a consulting firm. So they worked really, really closely and hands-on with all of their consulting partners to get the pain point and really solve firsthand challenges that they saw. I think that combination of being at the right place at the right time and also getting to work really closely with people's day-to-day problems created a really special experience.

Lenny (00:25:29):
I didn't know that. That's a really important element of the story is basically they were focused... How long did they do that Fishtown Analytics consultancy?

Julia Schottenstein (00:25:38):
Board consulting part of the business was almost two years.

Lenny (00:25:42):
Okay. So they basically spent two years solving this problem basically manually for people, and that's such a great way to understand real pain and figure out how to solve it.

Julia Schottenstein (00:25:53):
Totally.

Lenny (00:25:54):
Awesome. Okay, so that's a really interesting insight. Just spend a few years. It sounds like it was almost manually helping people transform their data using whatever tools already existed.

Julia Schottenstein (00:26:05):
Yeah. Well, they were building dbt and using dbt to help them do their jobs better and supporting their clients. And whenever they encountered paper cuts or friction or the workflow was taking longer than they expected, they would build that into dbt. And that really matured the experience of the product because the people who were building it, the founders were also day-to-day working with these customers or clients that had pain points.

Lenny (00:26:36):
That reminds me of a story you told me about how you made your eng team do some manual work of an algorithm involved in transformation. Can you share that?

Julia Schottenstein (00:26:47):
Okay. So I'm going to preface this story by sharing that I'm a huge math nerd and one of my favorite books on logic is called Girdle Escher Bach. And in this book there's a fun scene where there's an ant farm that bands together to do the work of a computer flipping bits from zero to one to solve logic gates. So this chapter of that book was really the inspiration for an exercise that I ran my team through. So about a year ago we were doing a big zero to one new project at dbt Labs and we were going to change the algorithm for how we built customers data transformation graphs. And I needed a way for the team to really internalize all of the changes that we were going to be making and I needed them to own it because otherwise they wouldn't be able to anticipate all of the edge cases and it wouldn't be quite as durable. You couldn't copy paste the algorithm.

(00:27:41):
So I showed up to a team offsite with a spool of rope and sticky notes and I think my team looked at me crazy, went with two heads when I started to tie people up to create a graph. So each note of the graph was an engineer and the rope was the edges of the graph to connect them. And then we worked through the new algorithm extremely slowly, step by step. And it was a way that you couldn't leave that exercise without knowing exactly what was going on because everyone had a role to play.

(00:28:16):
So I think a lot of times when you're starting something new, you get into a situation where a few people really understand it and they're running way ahead of the rest of the pack. But I needed a way for the whole team to go along for the journey. So I'm constantly trying to create these important moments or memorable moments for the team so that it's centered around our mission and they can have the ownership of taking the project and making it successful. So it was perhaps a overly creative or kooky way to spend the day, but it was really successful.

Lenny (00:28:49):
What was the actual algorithm you were trying to implement?

Julia Schottenstein (00:28:53):
We were trying to figure out how to make flipping the way that we run people's dags from an imperative way to a declarative way. So instead of running things left to when data arrived in your warehouse. You think about it as reverse, like what would need to happen to make your data SLAs be materialized in time.

Lenny (00:29:16):
Awesome. And sounds like the team found that valuable.

Julia Schottenstein (00:29:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:20):
Okay. Reminds me of a clip from this last season of Ted Lasso where they have used red strings and I won't get into it, but if you've seen it you will know what I'm talking about. I want to come back to your chatting about open source versus not open source. So some part of dbt was is open source and some isn't. I'm curious how the team decides what is open source and what should be open source, what isn't open source and what to charge for?

Julia Schottenstein (00:29:50):
We think about dbt open source. It's really the guts of the data transformation. It's where you describe your business logic. And then on the cloud side we build proprietary software that supercharges the development life cycle and the productionization of dbt at scale. So what we think about as leaving for our cloud offering is we deal with state, so stateful interactions and also any cross team or structural collaboration. We want to reserve that for our proprietary offering. And I think it's really important to have that distinction of what do you believe should be open source or what is the open standard that really matters? And ecosystem to us is really important. So it's important that that remains open source, but then we want to supercharge that experience with an open core model and build proprietary software that makes people much more successful at using dbt.

Lenny (00:30:48):
Today's episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products, then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about AssemblyAI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs. Product team that startups and enterprises are using AssemblyAI to automatically transcribe and summarize phone calls and virtual meetings, detect topics in podcasts, pinpoint when sensitive content spoken and lots more. All of AssemblyAI's models which are accessed through their API are production ready.

(00:31:26):
So many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI and AssemblyAI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases. Now's the time to check out AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to bring the highest accuracy transcription plus valuable insights to your customers. Just like Spotify, CallRail and writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground. That's assemblyai.com/lenny. I know you also spent a lot of time thinking about pricing and willingness to pay and things along those lines.

(00:32:03):
Is there anything you could share about which is what you've learned about how to think about pricing for a tool like this or even in general?

Julia Schottenstein (00:32:09):
Pricing and willingness to pay is such a hard conversation and lots of startups don't do this early enough in their company journey. Likely a side effect of zero interest rates where investors were happy funding GitHub stars and usage and companies never thought about how am I going to make revenue or make money, which is it's important. So for us at dbt Labs, I don't claim to be perfect at it, but we're trying to get a better muscle around it. And I always think about Madhavan who wrote this book Pricing Innovation. I know you've had him on the show before, but he shares that you don't get to decide if you're going to have a pricing or willingness to pay a conversation. You only get to decide what. So it's much better to have that conversation before you build the product than have it when your sales team's trying to sell something and people aren't excited about what you've built, aren't willing to pay for it.

(00:33:04):
And at dbt Labs we have this value, it's one of our core values that says we are more concerned with value creation than value capture. And we really mean this. When we talk about what is the value of dbt Labs to our customers, they often talk about how it's either 20 to 35% as valuable as what they spend on their cloud data warehouse. But what we charge our customers is a very small fraction of that 20 to 35% and that's by design. And last year we did our first ever pricing change in the company history and you learn a tremendous amount when you have that event because you get to test the price elasticity by of your customers.

(00:33:49):
And it's so important to learn that lesson while the company is still smaller or the stakes are lower because pricing just is always evolving. It's not a fixed thing, it gets more complex over time. So we have to think about it quite a bit because my team builds proprietary software for dbt cloud and when we lose a deal we most often lose it to dbt open source and we like it that way. We're happy to lose to ourselves, but we have to really think very deeply about what are people willing to pay for and what moves the needle for them and focus on that.

Lenny (00:34:26):
I'm so curious what that pricing process was like to figure out what to change. Is there anything you could share about just what that was for you or what are some just surprises that came out of that process or just like, "Wow, we didn't expect that in these conversations?"

Julia Schottenstein (00:34:42):
It's really like an all hands on deck conversation. Pricing is so cross-cutting because it's a finance discussion as well. You're modeling out things in spreadsheets and figuring out how that might impact the business. But you can't just solve these problems in spreadsheets. You have to go talk to customers, test the waters, understand where people's appetites are and sussing that out is really hard. And then of course there's a product piece to it too where you have to affect it and communicate it as well. So it was very cross-cutting. We learned a lot. We track our conversion rates really carefully. We track our turn rates very carefully and I think largely we were happy with the change that we made and we felt like one of the big things that we were trying to solve for was have our pricing catch up to how people valued the tool.

Lenny (00:35:40):
How many people did you end up talking to, who was doing these conversations and is there anything really important you learned about how to ask these questions and these sorts of leanness to pay conversations?

Julia Schottenstein (00:35:50):
So we talked to dozens. It was combination of product and product marketing, having the conversations and people aren't very willing to share explicitly what they will pay. But there's some tools that we use on relative value. People most think about what is the relative value of dbt in their cloud warehouse. And we also tried to employ some of the tactics that we tried to suss out what do people view as very inexpensive? What's a price point that's very cheap or a no-brainer? What price point is maybe fair or comfortable for them and what would be too expensive? And then we had all the data back to figure out where we landed.

Lenny (00:36:34):
I want to come back to M&A for a bit. I had a few more questions there and I moved on from that. So again, you've done a lot of work within the M&A realm. Something that I saw recently, and this connects to the fact that a lot of startups now are looking to get sold. This VC hunter walk, he's a founder of Home Brew Ventures, had this interesting blog post where he basically suggested you should actually think about being public about the fact that you're selling your company. Which is crazy because in the past you never want to come across as too selly. I don't want people to think I'm desperate. And his point is many startups are desperate right now and it's okay to be public about that. And then in theory creates more of a bidding situation where many people know versus keeping it secret and in closed rooms. So my question is just what do you think of that? Do you think that's effective strategy? Is it not?

Julia Schottenstein (00:37:28):
I think it's good advice. If you're in a Hail Mary situation where you're looking for a home or you need an exit for your business, it's better to be transparent and cast a wider net. And you're right, in previous times founders tried to be a little bit cute or obfuscate that they were evasive the situation that they were in because they wanted to drum up some competitive interest when there really wasn't any. But unfortunately in today's climate, too many companies are in that spot so it's impossible to hide it. So the better approach is just to be transparent and I see it pretty regularly and there's absolutely no shame in sending a note that says something like, "Hey, we're looking for an exit for our company X, Y, and Z didn't pan out as we expected. We built a really interesting product and we want to keep the team together. We're running a process. Are you interested?" Really just as simple as that.

Lenny (00:38:24):
I've seen a lot of companies put together these really detailed decks or even websites of just like, here's the team, here's what we built to be very promotional about it. Is that something you've seen? Is that something you'd recommend?

Julia Schottenstein (00:38:35):
Yeah. Usually in these situations people are acquiring the teams and so having your data room together, really the most important thing is these are the team members that are going to come along with the acquisition is the biggest motivator for why a buyer would get excited.

Lenny (00:38:52):
You made this point earlier that a lot of the seeds need to be planted early for you to have the best outcome. And this reminded me... So I had a startup local mine that we sold to Airbnb and I met Airbnb initially at a year before we actually started exploring the process at a random party at South by Southwest where I was, I actually have no memory of this party, but the head of product at Airbnb, Joe bought, remembered it and came back to us a year later and just like, "Hey, what are you guys up to? Maybe we could collaborate on some stuff," and that led to an acquisition. So I think that's just wanted to touch a ban on that point of just the power of, the way I thought about it is let a thousand flowers bloom, just like meet everyone. Get the word out that you're around and what you're doing so that in the future when someone has that problem they're like, "That company, maybe we should talk to them."

Julia Schottenstein (00:39:37):
Yeah, you want to make sure that the buyer knows who you are before the acquisition moment and hopefully that's because you've made an impact and they like what you're building. Maybe you've inflicted some pain on them. But yeah, certainly creating those connections well ahead of an exit event is important.

Lenny (00:39:58):
And specifically there it's meet people at your competitors potentially. For us, Airbnb was never even a potential company we would sell to because it had nothing to do with it but ended up making sense down the road. What's like the realm of the companies and people that you think people should think about meeting?

Julia Schottenstein (00:40:12):
If the company is buying a lot or they're active, they often have corp dev teams and so use that corp dev team to your advantage. It's their job to meet absolutely every company that could be potentially interested. So take that meeting, say you're not interested in an acquisition just yet, but push them to make an introduction to someone that could sponsor the deal. So usually that's someone in product or maybe a GM and use that as a starting point for maybe just a conversation, maybe something more like a partnership but get the corp dev team to work for you.

Lenny (00:40:50):
What if you're at the other end of the spectrum and you're in dire straits right now and you're just like, "Man, what do we do to potentially sell this company?" I know odds are not going to be great, but just what do you suggest folks do in terms of I guess finding connections to potential companies that might be acquirers?

Julia Schottenstein (00:41:07):
Yeah. I mean use your network. Usually your venture capitalist has a really big network and one of the things that I hear founders feeling the most nervous about is a duty to return the money to the investors. And maybe this is a unpopular thing to say on a podcast, but your investors understand that they're not making their money back. And what they want to do instead is have you end up at a really great company like an Airbnb because that will help them down the road. So it's all about the long game, but use your investors to help you find connections at different companies that could be buying and don't worry so much about disappointing them or being really realistic about where you are in your company journey.

Lenny (00:41:55):
To build on that, I'm just an angel investor, I'm not like the lead fund and they feel differently I imagine. But the last thing I want for a founders to get stuck at a company they hate and just so that they could return some money or have some outcome rather they just give up, move on. Life is short.

Julia Schottenstein (00:42:11):
Yeah. I think founders forget that it is so risky investing in early stage companies that 50% of portfolios investments don't return anything. And that's just part of the game and it's a very acceptable path where hey, we gave it our best shot. It didn't work out and moving on.

Lenny (00:42:36):
Which is tough a lot of times for founders that are told like it's all about grit and not giving up and don't quit. Sometimes you should quit.

Julia Schottenstein (00:42:43):
Gosh, yeah. I don't want to say that. I think being founders, it's an extremely lonely role sometimes and it is very hard to know what your next chapter will look like or what the journey will look like and sometimes you really are out of cash and you do have to find a home. But I hope that you can continue to fight and find a way forward.

Lenny (00:43:08):
Agreed. Specifically for people thinking about selling their company, are there any companies you think are good companies for people to look at right now that are actively acquiring or open to M&A?

Julia Schottenstein (00:43:19):
This is a tough one. I think a lot of companies are on the sidelines for a number of reasons. And they could be on the sidelines because they just did an acquisition and they're trying to digest or integrate that company. They could be on the sidelines because they're not growing headcount as much and M&A is often org chart gymnastics of folding the target companies headcount into your budget and plan and maybe just don't have a lot of space. Or probably more common right now is there's just a general uncertainty about the future. And in highly volatile markets people want to take care of their own and even the best M&A deals at a level of complexity that a lot of buyers are just not looking to take on right now.

(00:44:07):
So there are a number of reasons why people might sit out, but what I would do if I were in a position of wanting to sell my company is I would come up with a buyer set of maybe a dozen and really there aren't more than a dozen companies that will find what you're doing to be a very good fit. Start with your buyer set and then start calling the list by looking at some of the criteria that might count people out. And then go have those conversations. And if you're in a Hail Mary situation, be very transparent about it. Maybe open up the buyer list. But if you still have some room, I would maybe focus on two to three partner or buyers and really play a different playbook, which is inflict pain. Make it really hard for them to not notice you but do it with a smile and be friendly at while you do that.

Lenny (00:44:57):
Sometimes with M&A discussions, there's a lot of subtlety to the way you communicate where you don't come out and be like, please we'd love to sell our company to you. Any advice on just the phrasing and how to approach it or do you think it's just, it's fine, just tell us we're looking to sell our company. Are you interested in being buyer?

Julia Schottenstein (00:45:15):
Yeah. I just wouldn't be too clever here. Everyone understands like I'm evaluating strategic alternatives. It means you're looking to sell your company and it depends. Do you have time? If you have time, yeah. Don't come out and say, "Hey, I'm for sale." That's not going to end up in a good outcome. But depends where you are in your company journey. If you have time, then don't talk about M&A at all. That's the last thing that you want to speak about. Instead, you're talking about maybe collaborating or partnerships. How do we work together? Knowledge sharing and M&A is a dirty word if you have a lot of runway and you're going to try to continue to pursue an independent path, but if you're out of time, you're out of time.

Lenny (00:46:08):
That's such good advice. I remember the term we used was we want to explore a strategic partnership and everyone's just like, I knows what you mean by that, but you just don't want to say it.

Julia Schottenstein (00:46:19):
Yeah. It's like everyone in the room's looking like yeah. Okay. Strategic partnership or a strategic alternative, it's like we all know these code words and we understand the situation you're in.

Lenny (00:46:31):
Yeah. When do you think M&A market might pick up again? I know it's impossible to predict. Do you have any sense?

Julia Schottenstein (00:46:37):
Yeah. I wish I had a magic ball. That'd be pretty sweet. I think what is happening though is we're far enough out from the peak of the markets. So the peak was really November of 2021. And why does that matter? Two things. One, founders are coming to terms with valuations that they maybe received at the highest of the market, are no longer going to hold in this market and companies are out of cash or maybe out of options. We'll be better assets entering the market soon. And at a certain point the opportunities will just be too great. That will incentivize a lot of the buyers that have been on the bench to start participating again in the M&A market. And I don't know exactly when that will be, but I think we're pretty close. I think we're pretty close.

Lenny (00:47:28):
And you mentioned a value that you have at dbt. I forget exactly what it was, but I'm curious what are the other values that you have at dbt, whatever you can share. Always curious what principles and values companies come down to help drive the way they think.

Julia Schottenstein (00:47:42):
The value that I shared is we are more concerned with value creation than value capture and that really drives everything that we do. We try to put a lot of good out into the world and it pays back slowly. The whole mission of dbt Labs is to help analytics engineers disseminate organizational knowledge through data. So we really believe also being participants of sharing that information and getting more people knowledgeable about all sorts of things.

(00:48:13):
Transparency wins. We're a really transparent company. We share our board decks. We have lots of communication and participation in all of our Slacks. We're writing culture. We have hard conversations in the open. So that's another a big one. Transparency always wins. We are humble. We don't ever feel like we are successful. We come at this from a very humble space where we feel like we have to serve our community and our users and that really motivates us. And then another one is just work done well as its own end and it's really focusing on the journey and not the end destination.

Lenny (00:48:56):
Awesome. I want to do a post someday of just like, here's the values all these different successful companies have come to and see if there's any patterns. I'm actually doing a post right now on Snowflake and on Figma and what you touched on. There's such a connection and a thread of obsessing with your users and making sure they're happy at Figma. I forget exactly what it is, but it's just like in this article, it's going to come out tomorrow actually. So people get a sense of when we recorded this where they think of their company as software as a service where service is their number one goal. They actually provide service and software is just a way to do that. And then it's Snowflake. Their number one core value is put customers first and they talk a lot about how they just actually informs their prioritization all I think, and all their thinking. So it's interesting. That also comes up a lot in what you're talking about, which I think it's easy to say, but I think what actually separates companies that succeed is they actually put this into practice.

Julia Schottenstein (00:49:51):
It's really interesting too because a lot of the people who work at dbt Labs came from the community, so they feel this real ownership in making the experience an excellent one because they were so compelled to come join dbt Labs because the product changed the way that they work or changed their lives. So that commitment to the community and product experience is really, really strong.

Lenny (00:50:14):
This isn't another thread. Maybe we'll go down real quick. I'm working on a different post around Reddit and how to work with really opinionated users that strong opinions about changes to the product and the way they described it, these guys were there for five years working with the community on the product. Is that to your users, the product is their baby, basically. It's like they think it's theirs versus the companies. And I'm curious, having a really strong opinionated community, what it sounds like you also have, what have you learned about just working with them to build product that makes them happy and avoid revolts and really upsetness?

Julia Schottenstein (00:50:51):
It's hard as you grow. I think it's just a challenge cause our community gets bigger. You can't service everybody's needs. But I think what we've done is everyone is very deep in our own product. I think one of the cool stats is at dbt Labs we have over 30% of our employee headcount has contributed to our data transformation workflow. So that's across every discipline. It's in obviously product, obviously in our data team. Our marketing team also contributes to data transformation. And our engineering team will also contribute to our internal dbt analytics project and that sense of really understanding what the experience is like and then soliciting as much feedback as we possibly can. We have a dbt Slack community of 50,000 and all of our employees are in that Slack channel regularly and can feel when we mess up or we don't quite deliver an experience that we're proud of, you will just see dozens of people trying to jump on board and try to make it better.

Lenny (00:52:02):
Is there any other frameworks or just general processes that you found to be release useful in building awesome product running teams?

Julia Schottenstein (00:52:10):
I'm not a big framework person, but there's two sayings that I find myself repeating or I either to myself or to others. And it's worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem. And what do I mean by that? It's really to help me combat this perfectionism because perfect doesn't exist and you should instead go with good enough because when you ship, that's the moment when you get to learn a lot from your users and you just can't anticipate it. You try very hard to understand exactly how people will use the product and get all the edges ironed out. But you can't until you ship. And I'll share an example. So my team helps support the dbt cloud scheduler and the initial version of the dbt cloud scheduler was pretty naive. We were a little embarrassed by it.

(00:53:02):
It was a big old for loop over a big old jobs table. So we would look like is it time for this job to run? Okay. Yes, run this job. Okay. It's not time for this job to run next, continue on. Is it time? Yes, run this job. And it would just loop over and it's extremely naive and very simple, but it got the job done. And I try to remind the engineers, we would be so lucky to have tech debt because that means people are using the product. And now we've had to rebuild our scheduler several times over because we do have meaningful scale. We have 8,000 companies using our scheduler. We have to manage 10 million runs per month. But what we didn't need at launch was a distributed scheduler with coworkers and RabbitMQ. We just didn't need it because we had no users. So these two sayings that worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem, just really reminds people like, let's ship, let's get it out into the user's hands and then we'll learn and iterate and it'll be a better experience for them.

Lenny (00:54:08):
That's a good segue to my last question. So weren't a PM before this role. You have strong experience in investing, investment banking business in general. I'm curious what you think product managers should maybe focus on more or learn more or lean into to become stronger product leaders based on the experience you've had moving into product.

Julia Schottenstein (00:54:30):
So I pull a lot on my experience or some of the things that I did was as an investor in my current role in product. And maybe I'll touch on what is the scale of a venture capitalist might be a little bit foreign for people, but venture capitalists, they spend all their day meeting lots of different companies, context switching. They have to know a little bit about quite a lot of different things. And they do this to refine their investment tastes or find their investor judgment. And they're also investing a lot in their network and connecting people, supporting people, and mining people for ideas that are way smarter than they are. So you do that all the time in Venture and I've brought a lot of those skills with me into product and it translates really well.

(00:55:17):
The first is I still spend a lot of time investing in my network and I think it's an underrated way for a PM to spend their time. And I try to build a network of operators at other companies that are like dbt Labs that are growing nicely, maybe a little bit ahead of where we are. And I ask them questions, how did you navigate open source? How did you navigate pricing? How did you navigate acquisitions? And then I take the best ideas, figure out which ones I can apply and bring it back to dbt Labs. The second thing is I really think my special T or my superpower is that I'm a T-shaped generalist. So I know a little about a lot of things from finance to business to product. I have to go a lot deeper in product in the areas that I specialize in. That's where the tail of the tea comes in. But it's precisely because I've had a diverse background that makes me more effective when I'm trying to get things done within the organization. Because I have just more credible experiences that I can pull from.

(00:56:18):
And then the last thing that I think maybe doesn't show up day to day in my product work, but in investing, you're constantly thinking about risk and the power laws, and we touched on this before, but most investments don't work out. You lose the dollars that you put in, but all the returns come from these rare events that make up for all the losses. You have to think about what are the uncapped upside opportunities in investing. And I think in product, you still have to do the same thing. If 50% of the things I worked on went to zero, we'd have a problem. But it encourages me to continue to make bets for the company that has the chance of bending the trajectory of our business.

Lenny (00:57:03):
We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:07):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (00:57:08):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:12):
Okay. So two books that helped me learn a lot about myself. Range, it's a book about generalist and also Quiet, it's a book about introverts. And then I like a lot of biographies. So a few of my favorites are Snowball about Warren Buffet, Made in America, about Sam Walton and Leonardo da Vinci.

Lenny (00:57:31):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:34):
So I almost watched a movie in preparation for this podcast, but I really don't watch things except in the holiday. During the holidays, I like Succession, but I have not seen the latest season.

Lenny (00:57:46):
Wow. You're in store for a treat. Favorite interview question you like to ask?

Julia Schottenstein (00:57:53):
When's the last time you had to teach yourself something new and how'd you do it? So I like to test for growth mindset and a thirst for learning. And then also why dbt Labs. I think a lot of people who come to dbt Labs have very authentic reasons why they're drawn to the company. And in moments where in things are tough, it's the answer to that question of why are you here, it's going to make all the difference.

Lenny (00:58:17):
And sounds like what you look for is just like an genuine enthusiasm.

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:21):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:22):
Awesome. What are some favorite products you recently discovered that you really like?

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:27):
I like Belly. It's a consumer social app that lets you find and discover restaurants and rate them with your friends. It's been a lot of fun looking at the New York City restaurant scene.

Lenny (00:58:37):
I've never heard of that. Awesome. What is something relatively minor you've changed in the way you all do? Product that has had a lot of impact?

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:42):
Do fewer things and try to single thread the team as much as possible.

Lenny (00:58:50):
And single thread meaning like one main priority, one goal?

Julia Schottenstein (00:58:53):
One mission. Yeah. We're all working rowing in the same direction.

Lenny (00:58:57):
Final question. You have a podcast, first of all, tell us what it's called, but second of all, what's a favorite podcast of yours other than this podcast and your podcast?

Julia Schottenstein (00:59:05):
Yeah. It's called the Analytics Engineering Podcast, so if you want to learn more about the data industry, I host it every other week with our CEO Tristan Handy. It's a lot of fun. Check it out. Other podcasts that I really like are In Depth, it's First Rounds podcast by Bretton. He interviews a lot of operators about how they do their very best work. And another podcast that I really like is the Logan Bartlett Show, which touches on timely trends in tech.

Lenny (00:59:34):
And In Depth I think Todd Jackson actually hosts a lot of the episodes too. Also, a huge fan of the podcast. Definitely check it out. And then say your podcast again and how can folks find it?

Julia Schottenstein (00:59:43):
It's called the Analytics Engineering Podcast.

Lenny (00:59:47):
And it's just in podcasting apps?

Julia Schottenstein (00:59:48):
Yes.

Lenny (00:59:49):
Amazing. Check it out. Julia, we've talked about inflicting pain and strategic partnerships and why worse is better. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Julia Schottenstein (01:00:03):
You can find me on Twitter J_Schottenstein, and you can also find me in the dbt community Slack also, Julia Schottenstein. Send me a note, reach me there and I'd love to hear from you if you have data problems or we can help serve your needs better, would love to chat.

## Transcript

Julian Shapiro (00:00):
Why do good ideas arrive after the bad ideas are empty? It's because when you've gone through a bunch of bad ideas, your brain, your mind starts reflexively identifying what elements are causing the badness. Then it becomes way better at avoiding those bad elements and you become way better at pattern matching the novel ideas with way greater intuition. Most creators are resisting their bad ideas. If you sat down, scribbled a few thoughts in a blank document and just walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you never actually finished the creative process. There's no way you would've come up with gold.

Lenny (00:37):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders, and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies today. My guest is Julian Shapiro. I actually spend a bunch of time introducing the wondrous Julian at the beginning of the episode. Instead, let me just share some of the things that we talk about. We get into a framework he calls product-led acquisition, which is work that has come out of his working with thousands of companies, helping to figure out their growth strategies.

Lenny (01:10):
We get into ways to increase your product's retention. Then we talk a lot about writing, the importance of novelty in your writing, how to choose a topic when you plan to write, and then a framework that Julian calls the Creativity Faucet. Julian is such a fascinating human, and I'm really excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Julian Shapiro. I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.

John Cutler (01:37):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (01:39):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics. But now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (01:50):
Well, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform that, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. The big aha was seeing how many customers we're using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (02:11):
Supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (02:15):
Yeah. Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.

Lenny (02:24):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to Amplitude.com to get started. Hey, Ashley, head of marketing and Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (02:38):
At least 40%.

Lenny (02:40):
How many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (02:42):
Well? Based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. If your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock- full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (03:03):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (03:17):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

He's an amazing writer, marketer and growth mind, investor, community builder, podcaster, tweeter. He's also an expert on building muscle. He's maybe most known for being the founder of Demand Curve, a YC startup that trains people on growth and marketing. Prior to that, he was a part-time columnist at TechCrunch. He was also VP of marketing at Webflow, which I had no idea about.

Lenny (04:09):
He also created a JavaScript web animation engine that is used by Uber and WhatsApp and Samsung and thousands of companies. Currently he is a full-time investor with his own fund and as a partner at Hyper. He's also one of the most hilarious and generous humans that I know. With that, Julian, welcome to the podcast.

Julian Shapiro (04:28):
This is the greatest honor of my life. Thank you.

Lenny (04:31):
Wow!

Julian Shapiro (04:32):
I'm crying from that intro. Very nice of you.

Lenny (04:35):
That's the idea. This is the greatest honor of my life. We match.

Julian Shapiro (04:40):
Excellent. We'll cancel each other out and we'll see how interesting this is.

Lenny (04:43):
That's right. There's a lot of hype. I know you have something like 250,000 Twitter followers. You're very good at Twitter, but I've noticed that you've only tweeted three times this past year. What is going on there?

Julian Shapiro (04:58):
There's a few things in parallel. One is a lot of people are writing threads and I found this to be very cringe. They're like these fortune cookie threads like here's 21 ways to rework your startup or something. I found them all cringe. What they actually do when you write that stuff is they attract people who think that's valuable information, and then they cause people who you actually want to follow you to unfollow you. I remember just seeing people unfollow me early days of threads when no one was doing them and I was experimenting. They were pissing off people that I actually cared to have dialogue with.

Julian Shapiro (05:36):
I kind of lost the momentum and enthusiasm for writing that sort of stuff. And now I'm only writing anything when it's basically a reflection or a condensed version of a blog post that I happen to be writing from my website. I know it's high quality. I know it's original. I know it's thoughtful. It's not for the click bait. That was part of it. The other thing is that it's kind of like too... Here's a mental model for thinking about the quality of your followers. You have people who follow you for the quality of your brain, and you have people who follow you for sort of you being a glorified curator. If they're following you for being a curator, they're sort of what I call labor followers.

Julian Shapiro (06:16):
They're following you for the work that you're doing, where you're finding cool, funny memes. You're posting cool, funny jokes. You're doing these fortune cookie threads. In contrast, if they're following you for your mind, which is category one, it means they're following you for the original thoughts and insights and takes that you have on the world. Someone like Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, is doing original takes. He's not trying to write threads for the sake of gaining followers. He's trying to write interesting novel ideas. When he does that, he strengthens the affinity that his followers have for him and his mind, because like, "Wow! That was an original interesting take."

Julian Shapiro (06:49):
They're following you for your mind, not for the labor you're doing, putting together a virtual Buzzfeed to count on Twitter. When people follow you for your mind, when they're mind followers, not labor followers, higher affinity means more loyalty, means they pay closer attention to what you're saying. And if you actually try to get them to do something with you, you have an event offline, there's something you're selling, there's a cause you care about, they're way more likely to indulge.

Julian Shapiro (07:12):
Whereas if they're following you for your labor, you're interchangeable with all these other meme accounts and there's no real affinity for you as the individual. I just care more about the quality of the follower than I do the volume.

Lenny (07:23):
I love that. That's such a good reminder, not to just focus on follower, follower, follower. I'm curious if someone... You have a lot of followers at this point and it's just so valuable to have Twitter followers. I've learned for me, anytime I have a question about anything, I just ask and I get so many amazing answers from people. There's this power to having a large following. I'm curious while we're on this topic, if you're just starting out on Twitter, do you have any advice for someone that's just thinking about building their following?

Julian Shapiro (07:50):
I mean, generally speaking, threads, despite everything I've said, are the primary way to get followers. There's a reason why people do threads as opposed to single tweets is because when people get exposure to a thread, they're basically getting exposure to the length of thoughts equivalent to you having sent a newsletter edition or a blog post in many cases. The more exposure, the more surface area you have, the more you give people of your brain in a single tweet, the more they're able to confirm that what you're sharing is actually a consistency from you.

Julian Shapiro (08:21):
Whereas if you just tweet one clever thing, they're like, "Oh, that's probably just a drop in the bucket. Who knows if that person can consistently generate clever stuff?" But in a long thread where it's 30 tweets and they're all good, they're like, "Whoa! This person is a machine. If I follow them reliably, I'll get more great stuff." It reaffirms to readers they should follow you, which is why threads trigger more follows. Basically you do want to do threads, frankly, and that's the backbone of it. Threads with very clickbaity opening tweets kind of how it works.

Julian Shapiro (08:52):
You can also port followers over from other places like your website and newsletter, just to start giving yourself an initial sample audience through which the threads can actually take fire pretty much.

Lenny (09:02):
Awesome. I wasn't expecting to go into Twitter as strategy, but this is interesting because you're really good at it. As you've said, your stuff is actually very thoughtful. It's not just a thirsty Twitter thread trying to find followers and retweets. Thanks for sharing that.

Julian Shapiro (09:18):
Well, it sort of started that way, because me and a few other friends of mine, I felt like we were the first people doing threads at scale. And then when we realized what it turned into, that's when we just stopped.

Lenny (09:28):
I love that. I know what you mean about these cringy Twitter threads. Anyway, what I want to do is instead of asking a bunch of random questions is to focus on five big topics and kind of go deep on these topics. These are topics that are maybe most popular of the stuff that you've put out across your handbooks and writing and courses and things like that and also things that I've found to be most interesting. Does that sound good?

Julian Shapiro (09:51):
Yeah, I would love to.

Lenny (09:53):
Cool. First, a little context, you write these super in depth handbooks on a bunch of different topics on growth and writing and muscle building and things like that. First of all, could you just explain what these handbooks are and why you create them?

Julian Shapiro (10:05):
They're forcing functions for me to hold myself accountable and to be thorough when learning something for my own benefit. That's all they are. Basically if I want to go learn growth or writing well or some other topic, I will go ahead and do a ton of research, read everything I can get my hands on, do a ton of experimentation to try to build a set of novel insights that you couldn't find from other people's research hopefully, and then the next stage is try to make it as concise and actionable as possible so that I can reference it for my own selfish benefit. Here's my guidebook for myself on writing better blog posts, for example.

Julian Shapiro (10:40):
And then by the time I've done that work, what usually happens is its only like, I'm going to make up a number here, an extra 30 hours of work to make it palatable and digestible for the public. If I've done all this work privately, why not make it accessible publicly? At that point, it winds up being acquisition fodder for essentially building an audience and distributing my thoughts further. That's why I do that. But the thing that I pride myself on with them is by no means are they thoroughly unique, but in every one there's a lot of original stuff folks on average have never heard of before.

Julian Shapiro (11:14):
And that's what I'm proud of, is coming up with those insights between the lines that make that thing, whatever the topic is, much more approachable. I've succeeded, in my view, if I've made something that people often mistakenly think of as overwhelmingly complex very simple for them to follow. I think that's where the dopamine hit comes from for them.

Lenny (11:34):
Well, my experience, you definitely hit the nail in my head with the handbooks you put out. It's an interesting middle ground between a newsletter and a book. It's cool to just have a digital way of doing that, of just kind of consolidating a bunch of ideas and going really in depth, but not having to write a book. Well, speaking of the contract there.

Julian Shapiro (11:51):
You have a very large newsletter that goes very in depth. That arguably is a more valuable asset than my handbooks for someone building an audience, because the newsletter has this built-in form of retention recurrence, where they get pinged in their inbox when you have new content, and then it becomes a referable thing and people refer each other and then they sign up for the newsletter. I do love the emphasis on longform via newsletter, but the reason I do it on the web is, and we'll talk about the trade-offs in a second, is it's much more digestible and referencable.

Julian Shapiro (12:24):
No one's going to go refer to the epic guide in their email inbox that's very hard to navigate for building muscle or something. One, it's a UX decision. Two, I get the SEO traffic, which you don't. And then three, it's basically a living asset that I can keep updating over time. It's not stuck in someone's inbox and getting printed out. One of the things that might separate me from other writers, at least many other writers online, is I'm spending as many hours going back and rewriting old blog posts and handbooks as I am writing ones.

Julian Shapiro (12:55):
If you come back to anything I've written over the course of a year or year and a half, it'll be updated, because I consider everything I write to be evergreen. I avoid writing things that I feel like are a drop in the pan, just like talking about a trend or something, something very newsy. I avoid that altogether and I'm just interested in writing stuff that'll be relevant for a long time.

Lenny (13:13):
I didn't know that. That is very cool. I love that you do that. You should make that clear. That's so interesting that this is not stale. Last updated, last week. I don't know if you already do that.

Julian Shapiro (13:21):
Yeah, no, I actually don't and I probably should. People have complained to me that I haven't, so maybe I will one day.

Lenny (13:25):
All right. We got a good idea out of this, if nothing else.

Julian Shapiro (13:28):
There you go.

Lenny (13:28):
Okay. The first idea that I want to chat about is something that you call product-led acquisition. I believe it's the most popular page in any of your handbooks. It comes from you working with thousands of companies to help them figure out their growth strategies through Demand Curve. I'm curious to hear what this concept is and how people can use it to help their products grow.

Julian Shapiro (13:51):
Product-led acquisition to your audience will be more commonly known as product-led growth, but I think product-led growth is a bit of a misnomer. It's often used, as you know, to basically refer to SaaS companies who are using self-serve sales funnels where a salesperson isn't required, right? Bypassing sales and allowing the product to grow itself. That's fine. But I think the term we really care about as growth marketers is product-led acquisition, meaning the use of the product grows the product. For example, if I'm using PayPal and I'm sending $1,000 to somebody else, there is no way they will not create a PayPal account to accept the $1,000.

Julian Shapiro (14:31):
By me trying to use PayPal in its everyday intention and me getting value out of it to settle a debt, I'm automatically enticing someone else, very strongly so, to also become a PayPal customer. That's product-led acquisition. There's a few different categories I've identified, and I think the reason why people like this part of this article I wrote is because it's, in my opinion, the absolute best way to grow any startup. If your startup can grow via product-led acquisition, not all can, maybe some are enterprise-base and all they're going to make work is sales, then it is by far the best way to grow because zero marginal cost to have users invite other users.

Julian Shapiro (15:12):
It's scalable. It creates network graphs typically and has compounding effects there in terms of both moats and the ability to acquire more customers quickly. Basically to the point I just mentioned is basically viral. The other interesting thing here is there are far fewer dependencies. Let's say your company primarily grows via content and SEO, where you're at the mercy of Google releasing an algorithmic update let's say twice a year, which occasionally will absolutely tank your traffic and most people know what I mean by that if they've experienced that. It's awful.

Julian Shapiro (15:41):
Or ff you're a paid acquisition-led company, as opposed to a content-led acquisition company, meaning you're running Facebook Ads, let's just stick a Facebook for now, Facebook and Instagram, you're also at the mercy of the volatility of CPMs and whatever weird updates Facebook introduces or whatever targeting options they suddenly remove. Your entire acquisition strategy is anchored on something that is completely out of your hands and very volatile. Product-led acquisition is like the better you craft your product and the incentive structures for existing users inviting other users, that's entirely in your control and the better you grow.

Julian Shapiro (16:19):
That's the quick context. Now, I'll go into some examples. We started with the example of... Actually one thing that came to mind that I love is Paul Graham, who we mentioned earlier, Paul Graham from YC, has this quote which is "don't start a startup where you need to go through someone else to get users." That always really resonated with me. Here are the categories of product-led acquisition that I've identified. Number one, like I mentioned, is users inviting other users to settle debts.

Julian Shapiro (16:51):
If I'm going to pay you money I owe you for splitting dinner on Venmo, or a business expense that I'm paying you, you're my vendor on PayPal, or anything that's allowing me to just pay you money I owe you and I have to use a product to do so, whoever is collecting the money from me is going to make an account on that product if necessary to claim their hard earned money. Almost guaranteed way for you to have user-led growth, product-led growth. Now, it doesn't have to be money. It can be settling a debt of like an NFT, for example.

Julian Shapiro (17:19):
Someone buys an NFT from you on OpenSea and the only way for them to receive their NFT, I'm just making this up right now, is to also have an OpenSea account or a wallet that's specific to that collection. Again, making this up. The point is if you're settling the debt of something you owe someone and they must make an account to capture the thing owed, they're going to sign up. That's category one. Category two is when you're inviting someone to join the product you're using to partake in a conversation that the otherwise cannot access. Why does Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, all these chat apps, Discord, grow so quickly?

Julian Shapiro (17:58):
Pretty obviously because if you and your little clique of friends are having your conversation in that app, then the person who's also in your real life friend group, but who hasn't yet installed the app has to install the app in order to have the conversation with you. Inviting people to critical, social, or business conversations in an app is the other way that you can nearly guarantee you'll grow very quickly from product-led acquisition. The business version of this is Slack. You sign up for Slack. You invite all your friends or all your coworkers. Then you even invite all your vendors via Slack Connect.

Julian Shapiro (18:34):
Slack Connect was a brilliant Slack feature where they're saying, "Hey, we're now going to encourage you to invite people who aren't using Slack who are outside of your work." I don't know how that's done for them as a feature, but in theory, it's a brilliant way to expand the surface area for inviting people via product-led acquisition. Just to recap where we are real quick, one of the ways of acquiring customers is to encourage existing users, to pay other people or to encourage them to come into your app to have conversation that's only happening on the app.

Julian Shapiro (19:04):
If I'm a product person and I'm road mapping my product, I will think, is there anything in my product conducive to either one of those two functionalities, settling debts, or can I introduce chat within my product? And if so, you might be cracking open an amazing channel. When I tell people about product-led acquisition, I'm usually doing it in the context of let's rethink your product feature roadmap to prioritize features that facilitate these things that can lead to explosive growth. I'll pause if there's anything you want to dive in there, but I have three more categories we could chat about if you want to, three more ways of doing PLA.

Lenny (19:44):
Yeah, absolutely. I just want to lob a question over there as you're going through these to maybe touch on this. Most founders would love to find a way to grow through virality and invites and all the things you're talking about. I find that it's often hard to lop onto something they're doing, if it's not a natural fit. As you're going through this, I'd love to know how often have you seen startups succeed adding something like this when their app is not a money exchange app or a chat app? I'm curious how often it works to add something like this when your app's kind of something else, if that makes sense?

Julian Shapiro (20:17):
Well, the real lesson is don't start a company if you have no idea how it's going to grow. Now, that's not categorically true for all startups. It's irrelevant for deep tech and biotech and climate tech and all that stuff, but for a lot of these people starting SaaS companies where they intend to grow very quickly among B2B customers or B2C. The real point of what I'm saying is if you have three ideas before you as a founder and one of them lends itself to product-led acquisition really beautifully, then lean in that direction perhaps if you think that growth is the key differentiator between them for what's going to lead to success.

Julian Shapiro (20:51):
It's like make life easier on yourself. Because if we're relying so heavily on SEO and content, which is extremely saturated, or paid acquisition, meaning ad channels which are extremely saturated, especially if you have low LTVs where we can't really tolerate the volatility of paid CAC or just the cost in general of those CACs, then we have to be thinking more strategically at the product level. It's less about tacking it on later, but sometimes this will work brilliantly if it's very organic. When we cover my next category, we'll actually see some examples of how you can pack it on more seamlessly.

Julian Shapiro (21:24):
But the other response to your question, which is a great question, is people mistake product-led acquisition for referral programs, which it is not. Because the referral programs are a tact on incentive trying to give people something to encourage them to invite because they otherwise are not inviting. Whereas PLA, as I've currently defined it, is through the natural use of the product, you get more value when you invite others. You settle your debt with the payment recipient. You get have a better conversation because now your friend Jack is part of the conversation. You don't have to incentivize them with anything artificial, with any rewards.

Julian Shapiro (22:00):
Referral programs generally are not exciting to me because you're usually trying to... Again, you're like self-selecting for folks who just want the reward very often. And then the people they invite might also just want the dual ended reward and they're not even here for the app really. And then they can bounce. And then they don't invite other people typicall.y. It doesn't have the same compounding sticky retentive nature of PLA. I'm not a fan of it. If you can make a work though, fantastic. Anyway, third category is what I call billboarding. Billboarding is this idea that the use of the product is inherently visible to people around you.

Julian Shapiro (22:40):
The product advertises itself. A few examples. Actually, where I got the term from is I was looking at these billboards above the highway in San Francisco, where I was seeing the company that actually hosts the billboards advertise their own logo on the billboard while also showing you whatever ad they were being paid to show. They were using their own surface area to advertise themselves. Another example is when you're seeing an ad network across the web, like Google banner ads perhaps, and it says they're brought to you by Google Ads, they're using their own surface area to advertise themselves.

Julian Shapiro (23:14):
That's billboarding. It's a brilliant free way to get a ton more exposure. There's a few ways to do billboarding. One is the classic example of Hotmail and iPhone. When you send an email via Hotmail, at the end, it pens a signature saying sent via Hotmail. Same thing, sent from my iPhone. Every single email sent from an iPhone device, unless you remove that signature, is a free billboard for Apple itself, which further furthers the brand awareness and gets more people buying.

Julian Shapiro (23:45):
For example, if you have a feature in your application where people are sending emails or communications to other users outside of the org, like it's an app for sending SMS messages or it's like a way to send invoices to your vendors, when you're facilitating that generated messaging, say brought to you by the name of your startup in the signature of it, really use your own surface area to increase your own awareness. That's billboarding in two different ways. The third way is the very obvious way of having something unmistakably recognizable out in the world.

Julian Shapiro (24:21):
If I drive a Tesla, if I wear Nike shoes, if I have Apple AirPods, all of these are immediately visible to everyone around me, which is why sometimes physical products can really explode because they're just free walking billboards all over the world. And then the sort of most topical hot example right now on Twitter is when you switch your Twitter profile to an NFT in a particular collection, you're billboarding for that NFT collection, right? Same phenomenon that occurred with the Bitcoin laser eyes.

Lenny (24:50):
And also for Twitter Blue, to be able to even do that.

Julian Shapiro (24:53):
Yes, exactly. Exactly right. Like Telegram right now, they released something like Twitter Blue. I forget, I don't know what it's called. But now when you're a Telegram premium paying user, it has a little star thing next to your name that everyone else sees. "Wait, what is that? Oh, that's Telegram Pro. Let me take a look at that." Last example, which is one of my favorites, is billboarding via the nature of your product being something people are compelled to share in order to use. If I have a Calendly account, I have to share my Calendly link with the world in order to create an event on my calendar.

Julian Shapiro (25:28):
If you're like me, you get a million Calendly links every week. That's the phenomenal form of billboarding, people are sharing it willingly. No wonder they've exploded. Same thing with Dropbox sharing file links and you're seeing the Dropbox URL, or GoFundMe, when people share the GoFundMe page. You get the gist. Billboarding costs you nothing, scales infinitely, can have compounding effects. And if your product lends itself to billboarding, it's just a phenomenal way to grow if possible. That's category three, I guess. We'll cover one last one, if you'd like me too, which is basically UGC, so user generated content.

Julian Shapiro (26:05):
Same sort of thing. Basically I hop on YouTube or TikTok or Insta or whatever. I make content. I share it with the world. In so sharing that content, the platforms brand themselves on the content. At the end of every TikTok video on Twitter that you've ever seen or Insta, at the end it'll say, "Here's the TikTok user's account." They're billboarding themselves into the content that users themselves are generating, and the users are incentivized to share that content off platform, which brings users to the platform, because users want to get customers wherever they can. They're going to cross-sell to their YouTube channel and so on.

Julian Shapiro (26:41):
If you have a marketplace like eBay or some marketplace for selling collectible shoes or something where you're encouraging users to create beautiful content of the items being sold, like these cool landing pages that show off the products, and they share it elsewhere, then that's an example of users making content they're sharing off platform that is useful for their own followers. Another example of UGC that people often overlook is Quora or Reddit or Stack Overflow or TripAdvisor, where you're encouraging users to create content in the form of conversation that then surface itself on Google and SEO.

Julian Shapiro (27:23):
Basically if you just encourage users to have conversations that are publicly indexed, that increases your surface area on Google for hitting more keywords and you get way more search traffic. Basically the question that this boils down to is to leverage UGC in your product, you ask yourself, do users use my product to make content in any way, shape, or form? If so, what type of content that they make should we encourage them to then share? And then how can we make the page that they use to share the content as appealing and as easily to consume as possible? And that's basically UGC. We'll pause there, but basically that's PLA in a nutshell.

Julian Shapiro (28:03):
The thing that all of these have in common is you're not spending a dollar. They scale super quickly. You're not reliant on, well, maybe to some extent with SEO, but you're not relying on third party volatility. It's a much healthier narrative for how you're going to grow and scale.

Lenny (28:17):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.

Lenny (28:57):
Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. I have many questions I'd love to ask, but I also want to make sure we get to the other topics.

Lenny (29:34):
We talked about acquisition, which we'll link to in the show notes, by the way, this whole post. The flip side you could say is retention. If you're a reader of my newsletter, you know how much time I spend thinking about retention and how important that is. I know that's a second topic that we wanted to chat about, because you've also helped a lot of companies think through their retention strategies and to help them retain more users. I'm curious to hear what you've found to be the best strategies for retaining users and increasing retention.

Julian Shapiro (30:01):
Yeah, sure. The way I think about retention, my favorite strategy is what I call building state. It's a concept I stole from video games, where basically the more you play any given game, the more state you're accruing. That might be your armor, your weapons, your character skins, and whatever. As a player of the game, the more state you build, the more you're compelled to stick around, because you don't want to lose everything you've worked so hard for. The more state you have, the more you can exploit that state to get more. The rich keep getting richer. The same mental models apply to let's say SaaS retention.

Julian Shapiro (30:38):
This is as old as time, or at least as old as modern capitalism. If you think of credit card rewards or frequent flyer programs, you spend money. You accrue points. You convert the points into rewards. Once users build momentum doing that, they're less likely to switch to a competitor. That's the age old example of building state. Software, it's unbelievably powerful. This building state concept is why mediocre companies like eBay or Craigslist remain completely unbeatable for decades. Even though the UX is bad, people don't like using them, they fail to innovate, no one topples them and it's because of state.

Julian Shapiro (31:16):
Let's walk through some examples. State, kind of like my PLA mega spiel, mega rant there, subdivides into a few categories, but I'll make this one shorter and less boring. The first subcategory of building state is when you're encouraging your users to accrue non-transferrable reputation, meaning they're doing stuff to build reputation on the platform and they cannot take that reputation to them off platform. They're stuck there to get the compounding advantage of that reputation. For example, let's say you've spent years getting 10,000 or more feedback ratings as an eBay seller.

Julian Shapiro (31:56):
You are not leaving eBay anytime soon, because that reputation's just too valuable. It's producing a huge boost in revenue because of the trust it engenders with buyers on eBay. It probably results in you ranking better in search results for an eBay query. Because you cannot move those 10,000 feedbacks to an eBay competitor, you're not incentivized to go use an eBay competitor. This type of stickiness, this non-transferrable reputation, basically applies to all marketplaces and directories. Same thing on Yelp. You as a restaurant build your reputation on Yelp. The momentum keeps you stuck there. You want to keep getting reviews and hone your reviews.

Julian Shapiro (32:32):
Airbnb with your properties, Etsy, for you as a seller, Alibaba, all of this stuff are examples of companies that are kind of old now, cannot be top old or haven't been yet. People are like, why? Well, because of this exact reason. This is why those companies pester you so much to leave reviews and provide feedback all the time. They want you to play into this game of in market reputation building. The second state building technique that a startup could adopt, and again, this is all under the guise of how do we maximize retention and build somewhat of a moat, for example, the second way you can do this is you encourage your users to accrue a non-transferable audience.

Julian Shapiro (33:14):
If I'm a big YouTuber and I've acquired a million subs, those subs can't be transferred anywhere else. I can't bring them to Twitter. In fact, YouTube doesn't even tell me their email, so I can't even bring them to a newsletter if I wanted to. The more subs you acquire on YouTube, the easier it is for you to go viral on YouTube. This is what I mean earlier by the rich keep getting richer. It's this momentum trap. It's very, very hard to convince any YouTuber to get off YouTube. If anything, they'll dabble with another network in parallel at best.

Julian Shapiro (33:43):
Basically if you have a startup where you're creating a marketplace or an audience graph, you want to encourage users to build a follower graph within that product that they can take advantage of by pushing their product or their content or their insights too. This is why Twitter... By the way, a big shout out to Substack, which actually allows customers to export emails off of Substack. Substack is not playing that same game, which is better for users and a very nice thing for the ecosystem. But this is why Twitch and Instagram and Twitter are just irreplaceable. I mean, not necessarily. Everything dies over time like Facebook, but they're just so darn hard to topple.

Julian Shapiro (34:26):
Let's maybe touch one more. I don't want to ramble so much about this. Well, this one's kind of similar. Basically if you spent a lot of time building a social graph in a product, like if I spent the last 10 years trying to remember the names of all my high school friends and elementary school friends and add them one at a time over the years to Facebook, or I've added all my colleagues for the last 20 years onto LinkedIn and I've built a social graph on these products where I've curated and found people, that's really sticky. You're building state in the form of taking time to expand the graph. The graph is a representative of the state, the work you've put in.

Julian Shapiro (35:04):
You don't want to lose those connections with people. That makes that product extra sticky. This is why social networks in general can be sticky. It's not just the fact that you have your audience there, it's that you've invested time. If Facebook doesn't allow you to export your graph out, then that makes it extra sticky as well, because you don't know how else to talk to old Jimmy from elementary other than Facebook. Anyway, there's actually many more of these examples of building state. I'm going to just stop with that. But the basic concept is what can you encourage users to do within your product that makes them more deeper entrenched in the product, and most apps just completely lack this.

Lenny (35:39):
I like that. It's a little bit like the concept of having skin in the game and just building more skin in the game with the product that you're using. One quick question, is there a company that you've seen do this, like add it on, and succeed and increased retention that you've worked with or out there? Just like is there a good example that comes to mind that added this piece?

Julian Shapiro (35:58):
Again, none of this is really under the context of telling people to add it on after they've decided what they're building. This is all in the DNA of the product you're choosing to build. I'm not sure. I haven't thought of those examples. I'm thinking more so in whose DNA, which company's DNA are they doing this brilliantly? For example, one form of state is... One I did not cover is when you're embedded infrastructure. If you're Twilio, Striper, AWS, it's really hard to move off or segment because it's so much work to redo your code and introduce all this risk to screwing up your code base. People have built patterns around how they work with your API.

Julian Shapiro (36:36):
A lot of modern API startups automatically capture the stickiness by virtue of being so deeply embedded into a product. Generally speaking, none of this is in the context of like, hey, add it on post hoc, pretty much.

Lenny (36:46):
Got it. I like that lens actually through a lot of these things you're talking about is maybe it's less like change your product to make this happen, and it's more idea selection. I know you're also an investor, and so it's a really good lens on how many of these things does this company have that I'm investing in.

Julian Shapiro (37:01):
Earlier I was mentioning why do I write handbooks, I wrote the handbook that PLA and state building come from to cement my diligence criteria for companies I believe might grow super fast and retain customers. You're exactly right. My investor's perspective is if you have a zero cost of acquisition mechanism for customer acquisition, such as PLA, and you can retain them through something like state building, but there are other ways to retain customers, then I lean in harder because I think you'll be more defensible as a company. Actually interesting little side note is you'll often hear retention and stickiness refer to as a moat, right?

Julian Shapiro (37:41):
But I find this term actually very misleading because very few companies have actual moats. To have a real moat, you're basically exploiting kleptocratic, meaning you're friends with the government and they're creating a literal barrier to entry for your competitors, or you have a scientific moat where you have an actual scientific breakthrough in the fusion energy space, plus protected by patents. Those are real moats. But the way most people use the word moat is wrong. In practice, your "moat" is just your mechanism for retaining users a little bit more than the average company.

Julian Shapiro (38:21):
I believe state building is one of the best ways to do exactly that. Really it just comes down to what are you doing to help users build state and get more value over time out of the product, not the same level of value over any time period.

Lenny (38:35):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit away from growth and into writing, which I know you've spent a lot of time writing about, very meta, and sharing on Twitter and all the ways, you have a handbook where you go into this concept of novelty and a framework for how to be novel and why that's important in writing. I'd love for you to talk about why novelty is important in writing and ideally share your framework for creating something novel that keeps people engaged in reading.

Julian Shapiro (39:03):
Sure. This actually goes back to your question about Twitter. What can one do to build an audience on Twitter? It often comes down to writing things that are novel. Novel is what powers click bait in most cases. The other way is via curiosity gap, where you raise a question you don't answer, but the other half is novelty is what gets people to click into a thread and read it. Novelty, I define, as new idea, so something I haven't heard of before, that's also significant, so it's not some trivial fact about Kim Kardashian, and it's something that I wouldn't have easily intuited on my own.

Julian Shapiro (39:44):
When you have those ingredients, it's new, it's significant, and you wouldn't have easily thought of it on your own, that's when you trigger that dopamine hit reaction, I'm not being scientifically accurate here, but you're going to get that dopamine hit like, "Whoa! That's super cool." The more you have readers pausing going, "Whoa! That was interesting," the more novel your writing is. My whole approach to writing is write something out, and then point out all the points of novelty. I do that by actually having 20 friends read something I've written and highlight the sentences that made them go, "Whoa."

Julian Shapiro (40:17):
And then I have this visualized map in a given blog post, where are the areas that people go, "That's really interesting," and then I can see all the white space between the interesting parts. I go in and I condense that white space. I chop it down so that the frequency of novelties as high as possible. This is how you get a blog post that just has this phenomenal momentum that gets the read to completion rate to be very high. The question is, what exactly does novelty look like? I've identified about five different categories for it, and this is the backbone of how I write in many cases.

Julian Shapiro (40:51):
The first category of novelty is what I call counterintuitive information. You tell people something and they go, "Oh wow. I never realized that the world worked that way," or different categories and you tell people counter-narrative information. That's where people respond, "Wow. That's not how I was told the world worked." Whereas counterintuitive novelty is, "That's not how I would've thought the world worked," counter-narrative novelty is, "That's not what I've been told. I've been lied to. Now you're telling me the truth." That also triggers a dopamine hit. Third category of novelty is just pure shock and awe like, "That's crazy. I would've never believed that's true."

Julian Shapiro (41:30):
For example, there's a volcano that's going to erupt the next 15 years that's going to swallow this whole island. Wow, that's shocking. Holy moly. Next category is what a lot of popular Twitter users do is what I call elegant articulation, where you're taking an idea... Naval does this, Naval on Twitter, the founder of AngelList. He'll say something that's a complicated rich thought and boil it down into a very concise sentence. And then the reader goes, "Wow, that's beautiful. I couldn't have said that any better myself."

Julian Shapiro (42:02):
That also triggers that dopamine reaction. There's a few more, but the point I want to get at here is all of these are formats for identifying the types of things you could say to get people to go, "Whoa." That's what I think of as novelty.

Lenny (42:17):
Something I've found to kind of identify something that I've written is going to be interesting is I just read it myself and I feel what I feel when I'm reading it the first time. Often I find that if I'm like, "Oh wow, this is really good and really exciting," I've learned to trust that feeling wherever that comes from. That's just like another way of knowing if your thing is interesting is like, are you excited about it? Are you interested in it as you're reading it? And that fades after you read it like 10 times and kind of edit and edit, but that's just a small tip I've learned, just kind of trust your own gut feeling when you're excited about something that you're writing about.

Julian Shapiro (42:53):
I agree. And that's why I tell people when you first encounter something that to you is novel, write down with a score, like let's say out a five, zero to five, how novel that thing was to you when you first heard it. You want to remember and capture the degree of novelty, because to your point, Lenny, it's going to become less novel over time. And then if you pull that out of your idea bank for a blog post in two years, it'll like, oh yeah, that will blow people's minds, even it doesn't blow my mind today.

Lenny (43:16):
Good tip.

Julian Shapiro (43:17):
To your point, the way you basically get novel ideas is you go live your life and write down every time you come across something that interests or surprises you, or any time you come across something that makes you think, "Well, that's obviously not true," meaning you found something that people say that you know the lie and you're about to tell people the way the world really works. Some examples of novelty... I'm scrolling through Twitter up here. This is a tweet I wrote where I wrote, "Reading many books is the most socially accepted vanity metric for adults." I give zero kudos for reading a hundred books a year, but I give you massive kudos for learning efficiently and making interesting things.

Julian Shapiro (43:59):
This tweet is an example of me using novelty. As we read the key novel part, it's where I say, "Reading many books is the most socially accepted vanity metric for adults." That is counter-narrative novelty, because the prevailing narrative is all the smart people I've ever met, they read a ton of books. They always have a book in their hand. They're reading five books a month, blah blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm saying no, that's a vanity metric how many books you read. That's counter-narrative. That gives people a dopamine hit. They lean in. They want to see what my punchline is and that tweet got a lot of engagement.

Julian Shapiro (44:33):
One more example. See if you can catch the novelty here. New tweet, "The world is not run by exceptional people. This is the hidden reason for imposter syndrome. We mistakenly think imposter syndrome is due to low confidence or low anxiety. No. It's caused by not accepting that your new world-class peers aren't that special. It's just discipline." The key statement there that has the novelty is the world is not run by exceptional people, and the type of novelty being used there is counterintuitive. Your intuition is the world's run by the best of the best or many of these experts are there for a reason.

Julian Shapiro (45:15):
I'm saying not in most cases. Anyway, those are some examples of novelty. Of course, these tweets took off largely due to that reason. People love having their eyes opened. They'll reflexively retweet you to agree with your worldview if they feel like you're finally speaking truth, the power, in some sense, if that makes sense.

Lenny (45:34):
We'll link to those in the show notes. By the way, I love your reading your own tweets voice that you have.

Julian Shapiro (45:40):
I'm adopting my... Who's the guy from Star Trek who's amazing, who reads the kids?

Lenny (45:45):
Oh yeah, LeVar Burton. Reading Rainbow.

Julian Shapiro (45:49):
There you go. That's my voice.

Lenny (45:50):
Julian Shapiro, the new LeVar Burton. I know you have to run in not too long from now. We have two more topics. How about I set up both topics and then you kind of talk through as much as you want with each? That sound good?

Julian Shapiro (46:01):
Sure.

Lenny (46:01):
Cool. The fourth topic we want to talk about is topic selection, how meta, essentially picking what to write about, and you have a bunch of great advice on what's worth writing about and the framework around that. And then the fifth idea is something you called it the Creativity Faucet, which is essentially how to get more creative. I will turn it over to you to share your thoughts on these topics.

Julian Shapiro (46:22):
Sure, sure. My pleasure. The way I think about topic selection, meaning what is it you should write about for your blog posts, for your newsletter, Twitter, company blog, whatever, books, is you choose topics based on two factors, what would you actually be able to complete so you're not going to give a pathway through and what will actually be high quality. I have a framework for helping you figure out what that is. Basically I believe that your likelihood to follow through on something you start writing is a function of the objective you have with writing that piece and how strong your motivation is for seeing that objective to fruition.

Julian Shapiro (47:00):
Here's what that looks like more specifically. Anytime that I write something, I'm first trying to identify what is my objective. Here's a few examples of objectives that I'll use before sitting down to write. Number one, I want to open people's eyes to prove the status quo wrong, or two, I want to articulate something that everyone's thinking about, but no one is saying. I want to cut through the noise. Another objective might be, I want to contribute original insights to my own research and experimentation. Hence, some of my handbooks. Another objective is just telling a suspenseful and emotional story that maybe imparts a lesson.

Julian Shapiro (47:34):
These are all clear cut objectives that give me a guidepost. I know that I'm done writing a piece if I can read the piece and say, "I've accomplished that particular objective," because people don't know when they're done writing, "Oh, I petered out here and this seems like a good place for an outro." With an objective, you know whether you should actually stop. But then the question is, how do you sustain the motivation to see through an objective? Again, an objective might be something like open people's eyes by proving the status quo wrong. To do all the work necessary to accomplish that, you need a motivation in my opinion.

Julian Shapiro (48:08):
I'll pair one of those objectives that I've selected with a motivation. Some example motivations are, does writing this piece get something off my chest that I really badly need to get off? Or does it help me solve a nagging unsolved problem that I've been dealing with and this piece is way for me to explore and find the solution? Or is it like me obsessing over a topic that I want others to also geek out about? These are all powerful motivations that I pair with an objective to guarantee my follow through to get done writing the piece.

Julian Shapiro (48:41):
By the way, everything I've mentioned in this entire chat with you, the novelty stuff, the topic selection, PLA, state building, everything we've covered, I have tons of examples on Julian.com. That's why I'm not trying to go through every single one.

Lenny (48:55):
Yeah, and we'll link to all that.

Julian Shapiro (48:57):
Absolutely.

Lenny (48:57):
Awesome.

Julian Shapiro (48:58):
The flip side I'll point out is that I think writing quality overall is... Again, these are all me being hand wavy and these are not rules. There's no right way to write, just like there's no right way to paint. These are just frameworks I've developed, that when I use them, I'm more frequently arriving at success as far as I define it. The thing I want to point out though is that very closely tied to everything I'm talking about is my framework or my equation for determining how good any piece of writing is, is novelty times resonance. Writing quality equals novelty times resonance.

Julian Shapiro (49:36):
Novelty is like we discussed, here are all these things that are giving you dopamine hits where I'm opening your eyes about how the world really works and shocking you and elegantly synthesizing things, times resonance and resonance means I can tell you the most novel thing on the planet. But if I don't wrap it in a way that resonates and really lifts off the page and into your mind and is something you remember, then it's fairly ineffective novelty. It's more like just trivia. It's bland, dry trivia. When you add resonance to the novelty, now it becomes a beautifully written piece. Resonance is a matter of including examples, analogies, metaphors, stories.

Julian Shapiro (50:14):
Really writing quality is novelty times the storytelling power you have to make the novelty resonate in the back of people's minds. The way that I structure my writing process is draft one, I'm just focused on finding my novelty, just the backbone of what makes anything interesting. And then draft two, I come back and try to increase the resonance by embedding story and analogy and examples. That's basically my process there.

Lenny (50:41):
I like that a lot. Just to add real quick, something I've learned is that if your stuff is really useful, it doesn't have to be written beautifully. A lot of people I think are afraid of writing because they think they have to write really well, like be real good writers. What I've learned is it's okay if you're not like. You just be good enough and you'll get better the more you do it. The most important thing is the content is valuable and interesting, which I think you're describing as novelty. I just want to make sure people don't get scared away and be like, "Oh my god, I need stories and metaphors and all these beautiful writing." Initially you don't is my experience, but it helps in a big way.

Julian Shapiro (51:17):
I agree. In fact, the biggest criticism of my writing is that it is too dry, it's too novelty focused, and there's a lack of the resonance, but I do that purposely because oftentimes people can over-indulge in resonance and then it really bloats the piece. As a reader myself, I like reading super concise pieces, like reference manuals almost. I'm looking for the length from personal anecdotes, personal stories of people's lives or life lessons they've learned that they want to share with me, or actual fiction. To each their own. You're spot on. Do what you would want to read to me is the golden rule.

Lenny (51:52):
Awesome, and also don't be afraid. Don't feel like the bar's that high if you want to get started.

Julian Shapiro (51:58):
What have been your frameworks for sitting down and knowing that one of your newsletter editions is where you want it to be? And what do you think is the framework justifying that a piece is or explaining why a piece is good?

Lenny (52:10):
The thing that I always strive for is this needs to be actionable and useful. It's something someone could take and do something with that day versus just a bunch of theory and pontification and philosophy. It's like, oh, here's a thing you can go do today.

Julian Shapiro (52:25):
That's kind of my bar is make it very actionable, which I think is specific to the type of newsletter I have, not necessarily broad writing the way you're describing, but that's what I try.

Lenny (52:35):
I love that. I agree with you, my rules of thumb are like it has to be actionable, concise, and novel. I'm not sure if you've seen this as well, but to make something truly actionable, I have to leave them with a cheat sheet. Because if I have all these actionable steps, but they're spread throughout a monster newsletter edition, it's too much mental work to go and make my own cheat sheet out of and have a quick to follow series of steps. I feel like compression is a key part of making something actionable as well.

Julian Shapiro (53:06):
There's a book called On Writing Well that taught me a lot about cutting two-thirds of what you've written to get to the core of it. I'm curious, what else are you doing to try to harden each newsletter edition to make sure it's good? Is it just like, hey, this is actionable and we were pretty comprehensive and I checked it past experts? Is that the extent of it, or what are you trying to do to feel like it's fantastic? What's your review process when you pass it by others as well?

Lenny (53:30):
I'm happy to answer that, but I also know you got to run soon. I guess we could touch on... We could just save the fifth topic maybe for a follow up episode is one idea, or we could touch on it.

Julian Shapiro (53:40):
Sure. Up to you. Anything you want, my friend. If you want me to cover the next topic, super happy to. Up to you. Everyone listening right now is like, "Man, Julian's just been fucking rambling for an hour." I realized we were not having a conversation. Now I feel bad because I was so in my momentum of sharing some concepts that I didn't really have a conversation with.

Lenny (53:59):
This is very normal for this podcast, so do not stress.

Julian Shapiro (54:04):
All right. Good. Actually, you should leave this all in here so they know I feel bad. I'm not cutting anything. What was the last topic again? Remind me.

Lenny (54:12):
I was just saying, I think one of the things people really like about this podcast from what I hear often is they like that I'm not talking a lot. They kind of like that I'm letting the guests speak mostly, because a lot of podcast, the guest thinks they know at all, or sorry, the host and they just talk, talk, talk.

Julian Shapiro (54:27):
Oh, got you. The thing is you are brilliant. You're an actual host who is a useful, amazing human being and we want to hear your thoughts.

Lenny (54:35):
What was the last topic again?

Julian Shapiro (54:36):
The last topic was the Creativity Faucet. We can save that for another talk, or if you want to touch on it, we can do that too.

Lenny (54:43):
Sure. Yeah, let's do it.

Julian Shapiro (54:45):
The quick version here is that this is an idea that I saw recur across three of the most prolific creators in the world, John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, Neil Gaiman. Ed Sheeran might work with other producers and so on, but the basic thing between the three is they're very independent creators who are constantly making blockbusters in large part on their own. I was curious, what on earth are those three doing that very few other people are doing? Taylor Swift also. One day I actually found the answer, what is their approach to consistently making phenomenal content? The way I found it was interesting.

Julian Shapiro (55:23):
I was watching a masterclass, like Masterclass.com, with Neil Gaman and he explained his process for writing fiction novels. And then in the same year, I watched the documentary of Ed Sheeran explaining his process for writing songs and they were identical. And then a year later, I came across a YouTube video that I posted on Twitter with John Mayer spinning his process, also identical. I'm like, fuck, there's the answer. They don't have a name for their process, so I just call it the Creativity Faucet. Very quickly, what they do is they visualize their creativity as a backed up pipe of water. The first mile is packed with wastewater, and this wastewater has to be emptied before the clear water behind it can arrive.

Julian Shapiro (56:10):
Because your creativity pipe or Creativity Faucet only has one faucet, there's no shortcut to achieving the clarity, the clear water of good ideas, until you first empty the wastewater out. If we apply that to creativity at the beginning of every writing session, write out every bad idea that comes to mind. Instead of being self-critical and resisting these bad ideas, you have to recognize bad ideas is progress. Because once they are emptied out of you, the better ideas begin to arrive. Here's the key part, why do good ideas arrive after the bad ideas are empty? It's because when you've gone through a bunch of bad ideas, your brain, your mind starts reflexively identifying what elements are causing the badness.

Julian Shapiro (56:53):
Then it becomes way better at avoiding those bad elements and you become way better at pattern matching the novel ideas with way greater intuition. Most creators are resisting their bad ideas. If you sat down, scribbled a few thoughts in a blank document, and just walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you never actually finished the creative process. There's no way you would've come up with gold. Like Neil and Ed, for example, they know they're not superhuman. What they're doing is in every creative session, they simply have the discipline to allot time no matter how long it takes, it could be an hour, to empty all of the bad ideas.

Julian Shapiro (57:28):
And then they're not worried about whether good ideas will come after the bad ones because they know the following process. You start with a weak imitation. You identify what makes your invitation weak, and then you iterate the imitation until it's finally original. And that is the process you have to just throw yourself into.

Lenny (57:46):
I love that. I feel like I don't do that enough. I feel like when I get to writing, I'm just like, "Okay, let's make this awesome." This is a really good reminder just to get stuff out. It connects to the concept of the shitty first draft. Just write. It'll be bad. And then you edit. You asked me this question, what my process is for writing, and most of it is just refining like a thousand times. I just kind of take a first pass and then I look at it, make it better, look at it, make it better, and just kind of keep editing for days and days and days until it's not bad.

Julian Shapiro (58:15):
I love that. That's what I've always done, until one day I was like, "I need a process here." Anyway dude, pleasure chatting. You're a gent. Sorry to all the listeners for rambling so much at a high pace. Cut anything you want. You can cut all of that. I don't care. Whatever you find interesting, go with. We're just going to have this final goodbye and that's it.

Lenny (58:36):
That was very anti-climactic. Cool, man. Where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Julian Shapiro (58:41):
Sure. You can go to Julian.com. It has everything, Twitter, handbooks, all that good stuff. And that's it. I hope you guys find the handbooks useful.

Lenny (58:50):
Amazing, Julian. I know you don't do a lot of podcasts. I really appreciate you being here. This was awesome. I'm excited to get this out.

Julian Shapiro (58:56):
Dude, truly my pleasure. I think you're awesome and you're why I'm doing the podcast. Really my pleasure, man. Have a great day.

# From managing people to managing AI: The leadership skills everyone needs now | Julie Zhuo

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions. There's something in this episode for everyone. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):
Bye.

# How To Win Friends & Influence Decisions (Julie Zhuo) | Lenny & Friends Summit 2024

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions. There's something in this episode for everyone. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):
Bye.

# OpenAI researcher on why soft skills are the future of work | Karina Nguyen

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Not only are you working at the cutting edge of AI and LLMs, you're actually building the cutting edge.

Karina Nguyen (00:00:06):
When I first came to Anthropic and I was like, "Oh my God, I really love front-end engineering." And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized, "Oh my God, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
What skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams, in particular?

Karina Nguyen (00:00:26):
Creative thinking and you kind of want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. I think it's actually really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
What do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?

Karina Nguyen (00:00:46):
When you taught the model, some of the self-knowledge of you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world, the model would get extremely confused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
Today my guest is Karina Nguyen. Karina is an AI researcher at OpenAI where she helped build Canvas, tasks, the o1 chain-of-thought model and more. Prior to OpenAI, she was at Anthropic where she led work on post-training and evaluation for the Claude 3 models, built a document upload feature with 100K context windows and so much more. She was also an engineer at New York Times, was a designer at Dropbox and at Square. It's very rare to get a glimpse into how someone working on the bleeding edge of AI and LLMs operates and how they think about where things are heading. Canvas

(00:01:31):
In our conversation, we talk about how teams that OpenAI operate and build products, what skills she thinks you should be building as AI gets smarter, how models are created, why synthetic data will allow models to keep getting smarter and why she moved from engineering to research after realizing how good LLMs are going to be at coding.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:22):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:25):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:32):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018. Focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001 today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:04):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:10):
That is very much our experience, but before the company and to some extent during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:45):
Karina, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Karina Nguyen (00:04:48):
Thank you so much, Lenny, for inviting me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):
I'm very excited to have you here because not only are you working at the cutting edge of AI and LLMs, you're actually building the cutting edge of AI and LLMs. You recently launched this feature, which basically... the first agent feature of OpenAI. I also just did this survey, I don't know if you know about this. I did a survey of my readers and asked them what tools do you use every day in your work and most use? And ChatGPT was number one, above Gmail, above Slack, above anything else. 90% of people said they use ChatGPT regularly. 

Karina Nguyen (00:05:23):
That's quite good. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:23):
It's absurd. It wasn't around two years ago.

Karina Nguyen (00:05:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):
Also, we're recording this the week that OpenAI announced Stargate, which is this half trillion dollar investment in AI infrastructure. So there's just a lot happening constantly in AI and you have a really unique glimpse into how things are working, where things are going, how work gets done. So I have a lot of questions for you. I want to talk about how you operate and how you work at OpenAI, where you think things are going, what skills are going to matter more and less in the future, and also just where things are going broadly. So how does that sound?

Karina Nguyen (00:05:55):
Sounds great. Thank you so much. Yeah, I was extremely lucky to join early days Anthropic and learned a lot of things there. And I joined OpenAI around eight months ago. So, yeah, I'm excited to dive more in into-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):
Okay, I'm going to definitely ask you about the differences between those, but I want to start more technical and just dive right in. I want to talk about model training. People always hear about models being trained, these big models, how much data takes, how long it takes, how much money toss it takes, how we're running out of data, which I want to talk about. Let me just ask you this question. What do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?

Karina Nguyen (00:06:36):
Model training is more an art than a science. And in a lot of ways we, as model trainers, think a lot about data quality. It's one of the most important things in model training is like how do you ensure the highest quality data for certain interaction model behavior that you want to create? But the way you debug models is actually very similar the way you debug software. So one of the things that I've learned early days at Anthropic was we've discovered especially this Claude 3 training, when you taught the model some of the soft-knowledge of, "Hey, you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world." But then at the same time you had data that taught the model some of the function calls, which is like, "This is how you set the alarm."

(00:07:30):
And so the model would get extremely confused about whether it can set an alarm, but it doesn't have a body in the physical world. So it's like the model gets confused and sometimes it'll over accuse. So sometimes it says, "Look, I don't know. Sorry, I cannot help you." And so there is always a balance trade off between how do you make the model to be more helpful for users, but also not being harmful in other scenarios. And so it's always about how do you make the model more robust and operate across a variety of diverse scenarios.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:09):
That is so funny. I never thought about that. Most of the data that it's trained on is kind of assuming it's like a human describing the world and how they operate. It assumes there's a body and you could do things, and the model is told you don't have a body.

Karina Nguyen (00:08:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):
Okay. I want to talk a little bit about data while we're on this topic. I know you have strong opinions here. There's this meme that models are going to stop getting smarter because they're running out of data. They're trained in a large part on the internet and there's only one internet and they've already been trained on it, what more can you show them about the world? And there's this trend of synthetic data, this term synthetic data. What is synthetic data? Why do you think it's important? Do you think it's going to work?

Karina Nguyen (00:08:47):
I think there are two questions here. We can unpack one at a time. But people say we are hitting the data wall. I think people think more in the terms of pre-trained large models that are trained on the entire internet to predict the next token. But what actually the model is learning during that process is actually how do you compress the compression algorithm here? The model learns to compress a lot of knowledge and it learns how to model the world. So the next prediction of the word, like, "Teach me how to drive," basically. And you only have a few words that will match that, a car. So the model actually learns about the world in itself. So it's like it's modeling human behavior, sometimes it's modeling... And when you talk to pre-trained models which are very, very large, they're actually extremely diverse and extremely creative because you can talk to almost any Reddit user through a pre-trained model.

(00:09:56):
But I think what's happening right now with new paradigm of o1 series is that the scaling in post-training itself is not hitting the wall. And that's because basically we went from raw data sets from pre-trained models to infinite amount of tasks that you can teach the model in the post-training world via reinforcement learning. So any task, for example, how to search the web, how to use the computer, how to write, wow, all sorts of tasks that you trying to teach the model all the different skills. And that's why we're saying there's no data wall or whatever, because there will be infinite amount of tasks and that's how the model becomes extremely super intelligent. And we are actually getting saturated in all benchmarks. 

(00:10:52):
So I think the bottleneck is actually in evaluations that we don't have all the frontier, like evals like, I don't know, GPQA, which is a Google-proof question answering, PhD level intelligence. The benchmark is getting to, I don't know, more than 60, 70%, which is what PhD gets. So it's literally hitting the wall in like evals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):
I want to follow both those threads. So the first is on this idea of synthetic data. Is a simple way to understand it, that the models are generating the data that future models are trained on and you ask it to generate all these ways of doing stuff, all these tasks as you described, and then the newer models trained on this data that the previous model generated?

Karina Nguyen (00:11:39):
Some tasks are synthetically curated. So this is an active research area is how can you synthetically construct new tasks with models to learn. Sometimes when you develop products, you get a lot of data from the product and user feedback and you can use that data too in this cross-training world. Sometimes you still want to use human data because actually some of the tasks can be really, really hard to teach. Experts only know certain knowledge about some chemicals or biological knowledge, so you actually need to tap into the experts' knowledge a lot. So yeah, I think to me synthetic data training is more for product... It's a rapid model iteration for similar product outcomes. And we can dive more into it, but the way we made Canvas and tasks and new product features for ChatGPT was mostly done by synthetic training.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:52):
Let's actually get into that. That's really interesting. I want to talk about evals, but let's follow that thread. So talk about how this helped you create Canvas.

Karina Nguyen (00:12:56):
So when I first came to OpenAI, I really had this idea of, "Okay, it would be really cool for ChatGPT to actually change the visual interface but also change the way it is with people." So going from being a chatbot to more of a collaborative agent, and the collaborator is a step towards more genetic systems that become innovators ultimately. And so the entire team of applied engineers, designers, products, research got formed in the air almost out of nothing. It's just like a collection of people who just got together and we rapidly started iterating with each other. 

(00:13:46):
Actually Canvas is one of the... I would say the first project at OpenAI, where researchers and applying engineers started working together from the very beginning of the product development cycle. And I think there's a lot of things that we have learned on the way, but I definitely came with the mindset of, "We need to do a really rapid model situation such that it would be much easier for engineers to work with the latest model possible, but also learn from user feedback or early internal dog food. How do we improve the model very rapidly?"

(00:14:28):
And it's really hard to kind of like figure out how people... when you deploy a product, how people would be able to use it. And so the way you synthetically train the model is physically figuring out what are the most core behaviors that you wanted the product feature to do. And for Canvas, for example, it came down to three main behaviors. It was how do you trigger Canvas for prompts like, "Write me a long essay," when the user intention is mostly iterating over long documents? Or, "Write me a piece of code," or when to not trigger Canvas for prompts like, "Can you tell me more about President..." I don't know, some of the general questions. So you don't want to trigger Canvas because the user intention is mostly getting answer, not necessarily iterate over the long document. 

(00:15:28):
The second behavior is how do we teach the model to update the document when the user asks? So one of the behaviors that we taught the model is actually have some agency and autonomy to literally go to the document and select specific sections and either delete it or edit, so highlight it and rewrite certain sections. Sometimes the user would just say, "Change the second paragraph to be something friendlier," and we would have to teach the model to literally find the second paragraph in the document and change it to a friendly tone. So basically you teach both how to trigger edit itself, but also how do you teach the model to get higher quality edit for the document?

(00:16:21):
In case of coding, for example, there's also the question of how good the model is of completely rewriting the document, versus having a very specific target edits. So that's another layer of decision boundary within edit itself is, "Let's select the entire document and rewrite completely, or do you want to have a very targeted custom behavior." And when we first launched the model, we would bias the model towards more rewrites because we saw the quality of the rewrites were much higher. But over time you are shifting based on user feedback and what you're learning from iterative deployment.

(00:17:02):
Lastly, the third behavior that we taught synthetically the model is how to make comments on any document. So the way we used that is we would use o1 model to seem a way of user conversation, let's say like, "Write me a document about XYZ." But then we used o1 to produce the document and then we injected user prompt to be like, "Oh, make some comments, critique my piece of writing or critique this piece of writing that you just made." And then we taught the model to make comments on the document on very specific [inaudible 00:17:45] So it's also what kind of comments you want the model to make. Do they make sense or not? How do you teach the quality of that? And it all came down to measuring progress via very robust evals. But, yeah, this is how you used o1 and a synthetic data generation for the training.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:07):
Okay, that's so interesting. So you talk about this idea of teaching the model and you mentioned how it's using synthetic data to teach the model different behaviors is a simple way to think about it. Basically that's where you do that by showing it what success looks like using basically evals. Is that the simple way to think about it? Like, "Here's what you doing this successfully would look like," and that teaches it, "Okay, I see this is what I should be doing [inaudible 00:18:31]"

Karina Nguyen (00:18:30):
Yeah, great. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, you got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:33):
Okay, got it. I want to start unpacking what your day-to-day looks like as you're building these sort of things. Is it like you sitting there talking to some version of ChatGPT, crafting these evals?

Karina Nguyen (00:18:44):
Sometimes I do that. Sometimes I do sit with ChatGPT. Actually, I think I learned this so much from Anthropic, is people spend so much time prompting models and where quality's a really bad batch all the time, and you actually get a lot of new ideas of how do you make the model better? It's like, "This response is kind of weird. Why's it doing this?" And you start debugging or something, or you start figuring out new methods of how do you teach the model to respond in the different way, have better personality, let's say. 

(00:19:19):
So it's the same thing of how personality is made in the models with those. It's very similar methods. But, yes, I think my time at OpenAI have changed. I think when I first came, I was mostly research IC work so I was like building a lot of... I was running code, training models, write evals, working with PMs and designers to learn, teach them how to even think about evaluation. I think that was really cool experience and I think it was just like an adoption of, "How do we do this product management of AI feature for our AI models?" Yeah, but now it's mostly management and mentorship. I'm still doing IC research code up to 4:00 PM, although. But I just kind of changed. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
All right, don't talk too much about being a manager.

Karina Nguyen (00:20:23):
Okay. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):
Because everyone's in firing their managers. "Who needs managers anymore?" That's what I hear now. Just kidding. It's interesting that so much of your time was spent on teaching product teams how evals integrate and how important it is. And I've heard this a few times and I haven't personally experienced it yet, so I think it's an important thread to follow is just how writing these evaluations is going to become increasingly an important part of the job of product teams, especially when they're building AI features and working with LLMs. So can you just talk a bit more about what that looks like? Is it sitting there with an Excel spreadsheet basically showing, "Here's the input, here's the output, here's how good the result was"? Talk about what that actually looks like very practically.

Karina Nguyen (00:21:02):
It certainly depends on what you're developing, but there are various types of evaluations. Sometimes I do ask product managers, or there's also new roles that we have, model designers, to go through some of the user feedback maybe or think of various user conversations that should have triggered... Under these circumstances, it should trigger Canvas. And then you have this ground truth label of, "Okay with this conversation it should look trigger Canvas, under this conversation it should not trigger Canvas." And you have this very deterministic kind of eval that for decision-making behaviors is like this.

(00:21:46):
When we were launching tasks, for example, how do you make correct schedules is actually really hard for the model. But we built out some of the deterministic evaluations that is like, "Okay, if the user says 7:00 PM, the model should say 7:00 PM." So if you can have deterministic evals whether it's pass or fail. And the way it works is all the... Sometimes I ask product managers to just go create a double sheet, have different tabs and what's the current behavior, what's the ideal behavior and why, and some notes. 

(00:22:27):
And sometimes they usually use it with evals, sometimes we use it for training. Because if you give the spreadsheet to o1 model, it can probably figure out how to teach itself a good behavior. And I think there are second type of evals that is more prevalent is human evaluations. And you can have specific trainers or you can have internal people to when you have a conversation of the prompt and then you have various completion of models, you choose the win rate. Which model is the best? Which model produce the highest quality comment or edit? And then you can have continuous win rates. And as you develop new models it should always win over the previous models. So it depends on what you want to measure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):
So interesting. Basically what I'm hearing, and there's something I'm learning about as I talk to people, is product development might move from this, "Here's a spec PRD, let's build it together and then cool, let's review it. Are we happy with this?" From that to, "Hey, AI, build this thing for me and here's what correct looks like," and I'm spending all my time on what does correct look like on evals essentially. 

Karina Nguyen (00:23:47):
You definitely want to measure progress of your model and this is where evals is, is because you can have prompted model as a baseline already. And the most robust evals is the one where prompted baselines get the lowest score or something. And then because then you know if you're trained a good model, then it should just hill climb on that eval all the time, while not also regressing on other intelligence evals. That's what I'm saying, it's more of an art than science. It's like, "Okay, if you optimize the model for this behavior, you don't want to brain damage in other areas of intelligence or..." This is happening all the time in every lab, in every research team. 

(00:24:35):
I would say prompting is also a way to prototype new product ideas. Early days at Anthropic when I was working file uploads feature, I remember I was just prompting the model to just... I remember we were launching a hundred key contexts. I was just prototyping this in their local browser. I did the demo. People really, really loved it. And they just wanted API for file uploads or something. And then that's when it clicked to me, and also one of the blog posts a long time ago, it clicked on me prompting is a new way of product development or prototyping for designers and for product managers. 

(00:25:20):
For example, one of the features that I want to do is have a personalized starter prompts. So whenever you come to Claude, it should recommend you starter prompts based on what your interests are. And so you can literally do it prompting for that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:42):
Mm-hmm. To experiment with that. 

Karina Nguyen (00:25:44):
Another feature was generating titles for the conversations. It's a very small micro experience but I'm really proud of. The way we did that was we took five latest conversation from the model, asked the model, "What's the style of the user?" And then for the next new conversation, the generated title will be of the same style. It's just like really little micro experiences like this. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):
That's so cool. Did you do that at Anthropic or at OpenAI?

Karina Nguyen (00:26:14):
At Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:16):
Okay, cool. I love the file upload feature that Claude has by the way. ChatGPT doesn't have that yet, is that right?

Karina Nguyen (00:26:16):
I think has the way. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:23):
[inaudible 00:26:23]

Karina Nguyen (00:26:22):
I think the way it's implement is very different though.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:25):
Okay. Maybe it's the PDF feature, because I use it all the time with Claude.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:28):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:28):
Okay.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:28):
That's cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):
Somebody needs to get on that. Main, it's wild how many features you built that I use every day and that many people use every day. This prototyping point you made is really important. It's something that comes up a ton on this podcast also of how that... is maybe the way that AI has most impacted the job of product builders recently is just prototyping instead of going from showing just like, "Here's a PRD, here's a design." PMs are more and more just, "Here's the prototype with the idea that I have," and it's working. You can play with it.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:54):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
Yeah. Okay, I want to spend a little more time on how you operate. So you talked about you built this in launch of this tasks feature, is that the way to describe your tasks?

Karina Nguyen (00:27:04):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:06):
So talk about how that emerged and let's better understand just how you collaborate with product teams and how OpenAI works in that way, whatever you can share there.

Karina Nguyen (00:27:14):
I think Canvas and tasks are going into the bucket of projects where it's more short or medium terms. And actually the way Canvas and tasks came about to be was it started with one person prototyping and creating a spec. It's kind of like PRD. It's like creating a spec of the behavior of the model. I don't think tasks is extremely groundbreaking feature necessarily. What makes it really cool is because the models are so general... Model can now search, they can write sci-fi stories, they can search for stocks, they can summarize the news every day. Because the models are so general giving something familiar to people that notifications is very familiar, having reminders is very familiar. So feeling like a form factor for the people who are very familiar, same as Canvas, Google Docs is very familiar, but then you add magical AI moment and it becomes very powerful.

(00:28:26):
But the way it comes usually operationally... Yeah, size is like a prototype, literally prompted prototype of how you would want the model to behave. For tasks, for example, you need to design... Literally design thinking is like okay, well, if the user says, "Remind me to go to lunch at 8:00 AM tomorrow," what information does the model need to extract from that prompt in order to create a reminder? And so this is how you design a spec for a new feature, like a tool. Canvas and tasks are all tools. So it's like how do you create the tool stack?

(00:29:09):
And then it's mostly like developing JSON schema. It was like, "Okay, from this problem maybe the model should extract the time that the user requested." And then you think about which format do you want the time to be? And then how do you want the model to notify you is basically the user should give instruction to the model. And then this instruction would fire off every day or something at that particular time. So, for example, if you say, "Every day I want to learn know about the latest AI news," the model should rewrite into, "Okay search for the latest AI news and this task will get fired at that particular type that the user requested."

(00:30:02):
And then your design is like tool spec. Actually, I don't know. I feel like sometimes it's through conversations I... Either people ask me to join the [inaudible 00:30:15] team and they're like, "Oh my god, we need researchers." Or like, "We need some support. We need to train the models," or sometimes. Canvas was mostly like I just pitched the idea of... It got staffed quite immediately during the break, so it's dependent on the project. And then usually with staffing is mostly a product manager, model designer, actual product designer, a couple of researchers and a bunch of applied engineers. Depends on the complexity of a project. And then for tasks it took, I don't know, like two months or so to go from zero to one basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:54):
Oh wow.

Karina Nguyen (00:30:54):
For Canvas this was like four, five months, I guess, to go from zero to one. And then you teach product managers how to build evals and maybe how do we not only ship the better feature, but how do we think longer term? What kind of cool features did you want tasks to have? I think it would be nice for tasks to be a little bit more personalized. It'd be nice to have to create tasks via voice on a mobile, right? This is how you get research roadmap right here is thinking how the feature will be developed in the future. 

(00:31:39):
And then from there it's like you start getting data sets. With evals, you want to make sure that goes well. And then you need to have a trade-off between what methods you want to use. And the reason why I really love relying purely on synthetic data instead of collecting data from humans is because it's much more scalable, it's cheap, less than half. You literally sample from the model and you teach the core behaviors of the models and that will generalize to all sorts of diverse coverage.

(00:32:15):
And when you launch the beta feature, you learn so much from the users that you can... All your synthetic sets can be shifted in the distribution and how the users behave on the product behavior. And this is how we improve. And this is what happened with Canvass too when we launched from beta to GA.

Something that I want to help people understand, and I don't even 100% understand this, is what's the simplest way to understand the job of a researcher versus say a model designer and other folks involved? What's the simplest way to understand what researchers do at OpenAI?

Karina Nguyen (00:33:48):
So the project that I described are mostly product-oriented. Research is mostly product research. Another component of my team is actually more longer term exploratory projects. And it's more about developing new methods, understanding those methods under a variety of circumstances. So basically developing methods, you need to follow very similar recipe of building evals but it's much more sophisticated evals. You want to have outer distribution or if you want to measure generalization, you need to capture that. 

(00:34:26):
But it is basically more sciencey in a way where... If we talk about synthetic data, one of the hardest things about synthetic data is how do you make it more diverse? Diversity in synthetic data is one of the most important questions right now. And so it's like exploring ways to inject diversity as a general method that will work for all is one of the research explorations. Other ones is more developing new capabilities. I feel like it's always about you work on this new method and you have signs of life that it's working, either you think of how do you make it more general or you think of how do you make it very useful? And this is how the longer-term projects become more medium, short-term project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:15):
That makes sense. Essentially working on developing ways to make the model smarter, o4, o5, o6. New ways to... o1 was a big breakthrough, right? 

Karina Nguyen (00:35:25):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:25):
The way it operates where it's not just, "Here's your answer," it actually thinks and takes time to think through the process of coming up with an answer. Okay. 

Karina Nguyen (00:35:33):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:34):
Very helpful. Speaking of that, of thinking about the future, where things are going, I want to spend some time on just this insight that basically you are building the cutting edge of AI, at the very bleeding edge of where AI is going and where it is. And so I'm very curious to hear just your take on how you think things are going to change in the world and how people work based on where you see things are going. And I know it's a broad question, but let's say in the next three years, how do you see the world changing? How do you see people's way of working changing?

Karina Nguyen (00:36:08):
It's a very humbling experience to be in both labs, I guess. To me when I first came to Anthropic and I was like, "Oh no, I really love front-end engineering." And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized at that time it's like, "Oh my god, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps or something and so it can develop new features for the thing that I'm working." So it was kind of like this meta realization where it's like, "Oh my god, the world is actually changing." And when we first launched 100K context at that time, obviously I'm thinking about form factors that's like file uploads were very natural, very familiar to people. But you can imagine we could just make infinite chats in the Claude.ai app, as if it's 100K context. 

(00:37:04):
But because file uploads... It's like form follows function. It's like the form factor, the file uploads can enable people to just literally upload anything, the books, any reports, financial and ask any task to the model. And then I remember it was either enterprise customers, financial customers were really interested in that. It's like, "Oh wow." It's actually one of the very common tasks that people do in that setting. It's kind of crazy to see how some of the redundant tasks are getting automated basically by these smart models.

(00:37:48):
And they're entering the era where, I actually don't know for example sometimes if o1 gives me the correct answer or not because I'm not an expert in that field. And it's like, "I don't even know how to verify the outputs of the models." It's because all my experts know they can verify this. So, yes, so basically there are trends that are going on. The first trend is the cost of reasoning and intelligence is drastically going down.

(00:38:22):
I had a blog post about this. Maybe I should update on latest benchmarks, because at that time everybody was doing one benchmark and they'd be... quickly saturated the benchmarks. So I'm like, "Now we need to do the same plot but with another frontier eval." But the cost of intelligence is going down because it becomes that much cheaper. Small models are becoming even smarter than large models and that's because of the distillation research. 

(00:38:56):
This happened with Claude 3 Haiku. I was working with the training on the Claude 3 Haiku and I realized it was much smarter than Claude 2, which was way bigger, lots [inaudible 00:39:08]. But the power of small models become very intelligent and fast and cheap. We are moving towards that world. That has multiple implications, but the news is that people will have more access AI and that's really good. Builders and developers will have much better access to AI, but also it means all the work that has been bottlenecked by intelligence will be unblocked. 

(00:39:40):
I'm thinking about healthcare, right? Instead of going to a doctor, I can ask ChatGPT or give ChatGPT a list of symptoms and ask me, "Would I have a cold, flu, something else?" I can literally get the access to doctor almost. And there's been some research studies around that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
There was a New York Times story about that where they compared doctors to doctors using ChatGPT to just ChatGPT and just ChatGPT was the best of them. All doctors made it worse.

Karina Nguyen (00:40:18):
Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy, right? Education I think I would have dreamt if I had the tool like ChatGPT when I was young and would learn so much. But it's like people can now learn almost anything from these models. So they can learn new language, they can learn how to build new look apps and write anything they do want. It's humbling to have... launch Canvas and bring that thing to the people, enable them to do something else that they couldn't have ever before. There's something magical around this experience. 

(00:40:57):
Education will have massive implications. I guess like scientific research, I think it's the dream of any AI research is to automate AI research. It's kind of scary, I'd say, which makes me think that people management will stay. It's one of the hardest thing to... Emotional intelligence with the models, creativity in itself is one of the hardest things. So writers, I don't think people should be worried as much. I think will alleviate a lot of redundant tasks for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:34):
This is awesome. Okay, I want to follow this thread for sure. And it's funny that what you described as you were an engineer at Anthropic and you're like, "Okay, Claude is going to be very good at engineering. This isn't going to be a potentially career long term, so I'm going to move into research and AI is going to need me for a long time to build it, to make it smarter."

Karina Nguyen (00:41:53):
I would say we still have... I think Canvas team has still have really cool front engineers that are really people who really care about interaction, design, interacting experience. I don't think models are there yet I think if... But we can get the models to this top 1% of front-ends and things for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:16):
So what I want to move on to next along these lines is just, and this is just speculation, but what skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams in particular? So folks are listening and they're like, "Okay, this is scary. What should I be building now to help me stay ahead and not be in trouble down the road?" What skills do you think are going to be more and more important to build?

Karina Nguyen (00:42:42):
Yeah, I think creative thinking. You want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. Listening. You want to build something that the most general model will not replace you. And oftentimes you build something and you make it really, really good for specific set of users and actually the mode is now in your user feedback. The mode is more in whether you listen to them, whether you can rapidly iterate. The mode is in here. I don't think we are yet to... There are so many ideas, I think there's an abundance of ideas that you can work on. I wouldn't be worried. I feel like in fact I just think people in AI field are like... I wish they were a little bit more creative and connecting the dots across the print fields or something like that to develop really cool new generation and new paradigms of interactions with this AI.

(00:43:53):
I don't think we've cracked this problem at all. A couple of years ago I was telling some people, I was like, "You want to build for the future." So it's like it doesn't necessarily matter whether the model is good or not, good right now, but you can build product ideas such that by the time the models will be really good, it'll work really well. I think it just happened naturally. For example, at Anthropic the Claude artifacts... And I feel early days of Canvas was, back in 2022 before ChatGPT, writing ideas was our knowledge [inaudible 00:44:36]. But I feel like Claude 1.3 model itself was not there to have made really extreme good high quality edits. For example, like coding. 

(00:44:47):
And I feel like I see startups like Kaeser was doing super well. And that's because they iterate so fast. They invent new ways of training models. They move really fast. They listen to what users like, massive distributions. Yeah, it's kind of cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):
That's really helpful actually. So what I'm hearing is that soft skills essentially are going to be more and more important, powerful. You just talked about management, leading people, being creative and coming up with innovative insights, listening. There's a post I wrote that I'll link to where I try to analyze how AI will impact product management. And we're actually very aligned, and my sense was the same thing, that soft skills are going to become more and more important. And the things that are going to be replaced is the hard skills, which is interesting because usually people value the hard skills like coding, design, writing really well. And it's interesting that AI is actually really good at that because it's taking a bunch of data, synthesizing it and writing, creating a thing, versus all these fuzzy things around of what influences, convinces people to do things and aligning and listening, like you said, creativity, anything along those lines come up as I say that.

Karina Nguyen (00:46:01):
I think it's actually a really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or do really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write. I still think ChatGPT kind of sucks at writing and that's because it's bottlenecked by this creative reasoning. I think characterization is one of the most important... I think for a manager, I feel like... 

(00:46:28):
Actually, AI research progress is bottlenecked by management, research management. It's because you have constrained set of compute and you need to allocate the compute to the research paths that you feel the most convinced about. It was like you need to have a really high conviction in the research paths to put the compute, and it's more return on investment kind of situation. It's like, "Okay, I'm thinking a lot about across all my projects, which projects are higher priority?" Prioritization and also on the lower level, "Which experiments are really important to run right now and which are not?" and cut through the line. So I was thinking prioritization, communication, management. People skills like empathy, understanding people, collaboration.

(00:47:23):
I think Canvas wouldn't be an amazing launch if it wasn't about people and I think it's a wonderful group of people. And I get a chance to work with people like Lee Byron who's a co-creator at GraphQL and some of the best Apple designers. It's so cool to see... and how do you create this collaboration between people. It's just something that's still humane, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):
Let me just follow through a little bit. I imagine people listening are like, "Okay, but once we have AGI or SGI it's like it'll do all this." There's a world where like, "Why isn't all this done?" I think it's easy to just assume all that. I'm curious this idea of creativity and listening, why you think AI isn't good at it, other than it's just very hard to train it to do this well. Is there anything there of just why this is especially difficult for AI and LLMs to get good at?

Karina Nguyen (00:48:20):
I think currently it's difficult for many reasons. I think it's still an active research area and it's something that I think my team is working on. It's like, "Okay, how do we teach the models to be more creative in the writing?" And so I'm thinking this new paradigm of wise that the models think more should actually lead to better writing in itself. But when it comes down to idea generation or discriminating of what is a good visual design or not, I feel like it hasn't had learned examples from people to discriminate it very well. I do think it's because there are not that many people who are actually really... It's not accessible to models to learn from these people I guess. So I definitely think that's why it sucks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:19):
Yeah, that makes sense. Basically there's not enough of you yet, researchers teaching it to do these things, slash people that have incredible taste and creativity that can teach these things. You could argue this will come. 

Karina Nguyen (00:49:31):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:31):
But we don't need to keep going down that thread. Let me ask you a specific question. In this post I wrote, I made this argument that a lot of people disagreed with that strategy is something that AI tooling will become increasingly great at and take over. There's the sense that that's the thing that people will continue to be much better at and you can't offload to AI basically developing your strategy, telling you what to do to win. My case is, "Isn't strategy, just take all the inputs, all the data you have available, understand the world around you and come up with a plan to win?" It feels like AI and LLM would be incredibly smart at this. What's your take?

Karina Nguyen (00:50:10):
I think so too. I think again, you teach the model all sorts of tools and capabilities and reasoning and it's like when it comes down to... For Canvas right now, it would be very cool for the model just aggregate all the feedback from users, summarize me the top five most painful flows on user experiences. And then the model itself is very capable of thinking of knowing how it's been made, figure out how to create a dataset for itself to train on it. And I don't think that we are far away from that self-improvement, models becoming self-improved by...

(00:50:54):
That, and the part of development, is basically self-improving. It's kind of like its own organism or something. Again, like strategies, it's more like data analysis and coming up with... I think what models are really good at is connecting the dots, I think. It's like if you have user feedback from this source, but you also have an internal dashboard with metrics and then you have other feedback or input and then it can create a plan for you, recommendations even.  And I think this is one of the most common use cases for ChatGPT too, is coming up with these sort of things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
That makes sense essentially a human can only comprehend so much information at once and look at so much data at once to synthesize takeaways. And as you said, these context windows are huge now. Here's all the information, what's the most important thing I should do?

Karina Nguyen (00:51:59):
Yeah, same as scientific research. Ideally the model would be able to suggest ideas, new ideas, or iterate on the experimental given the empirical results of the previous experiments like how do you come up with new ideas or the methods?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:18):
Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, so just to close the loop on this conversation, this part of the thread is the skills you're suggesting people focus on building and leaning into is soft skills like creativity, managing influence, collaboration, looking for patterns. Is that generally where your mind is at?

Karina Nguyen (00:52:40):
Yeah, I'm thinking a lot about how do we make organizations more effectively and I think this is mostly management, I guess. It's like how do you organize research teams or generally teams combined... Compose teams such that they will be at their maximally succeed or at the maximal performance of what can possibly... We can literally create the next generation of computers. It's just the matter of conviction and the way you manage through that. It's scaling organizations or scaling product research, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:15):
Yeah, I think you're basically building this thing and not efficiently doing it is limiting the potential of the human species right now.

Karina Nguyen (00:53:16):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:26):
It's mismanagement within the research team in OpenAI and Anthropic and some of these other models.

Karina Nguyen (00:53:32):
Yeah, it's kind of crazy to think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
Holy moly. Okay, so speaking of Anthropic and OpenAI, you've worked at both. Very few people have worked at both companies and have seen how they operate. I'm curious just what you've noticed about the differences between these two, how they operate, how they think, how they approach stuff. What can you share along those lines?

Karina Nguyen (00:53:48):
It's more similar than different. Obviously there was a lot of... There are some differences always comes to nuances. I would say culture. I really love Anthropic and I have a lot of friends there. And I also love OpenAI and they still have a lot of friends though. So it's not about enemies. I feel like there's in AI, it's all like, "Yeah, they're competitors. There's enemies." It's actually like one big community of people doing the same thing. I would say what I've learned from Anthropic is this real care and craft towards model behavior, model craft, model training. 

(00:54:32):
And I've been thinking a lot about, "Okay, what makes Claude Claude and what makes ChatGPT ChatGPT?" And it's like I still have some sense of operational processes that leads to the outputs, to the model. It's the outputed model. And it's like the reason why Claude has so much more personality and is more like a librarian... I don't know. I don't know. I am visualizing Claude being like a librarian at some point, very nerdy or something. ... is because I feel like it's the reflection of the creators who are making this model. And a lot of details around the character and the personality and whether the model should follow up on this question or not. 

(00:55:19):
What's the correct ethical behavior for the model in these scenarios? A lot of crafts and curated datasets. This is where I learned that part of art, I guess, at Anthropic. I would say Anthropic is much smaller. When I joined it was, what, like 70 people? When I left it was tons of people. And obviously the culture changed so much. I really enjoyed being early days startup lives, and people knew each other as a family. But the culture shifted. 

(00:55:53):
I would say that I learned from Anthropic that they're much better at focusing and prioritization of... Very hardcore prioritization, I guess. And they need to do it. But I think OpenAI's much more innovative and much more risk-takers in terms of product or research. Actually, in way your full-time job can be just teaching the model how to be creative writers. And it's like there's some luxury in this research freedom that comes with scale, maybe. I don't know. I'd say I have much more creative product freedom to do almost anything, I guess, within OpenAI, evolve ChatGPT into the vision that we want. It's more probably bottoms-up, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):
Yeah, that's how I was thinking about it. It feels like OpenAI is more bottoms-up, distributed, people bubble up ideas, try stuff. And that leads to more products launching, I imagine more things just kind of being tried versus more of a, "Let's just make sure everything we do is awesome and great and craft and thinking deeply about every investment."

Karina Nguyen (00:57:08):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):
That's really interesting. I've never heard it described this way. Karina, we've covered so much ground. This is going to help a lot of people with so many ways of thinking about where the future's going. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I'm curious if there's anything else that you think might be helpful to share or get into?

Karina Nguyen (00:57:23):
One of my regrets, I guess, when I was early days at Anthropic was that... I think there was some luxury of the time, because pre-ChatGPT, to actually come in with a bunch of ideas and prototype almost every day. And I think that we did a lot of cool ideas like Claude, and Slack was actually one of the first tool-usey products. It's like Claude could operate in your workplace now. It's kind of cool because you can add Claude to summarize the thread. So maybe you have an entire conversation with someone and then you want a summary of what happened you can ask Claude, "Summarize this." 

(00:58:07):
Also, it was really fun to iterate on the model itself. It's like when you just talk to the model in Slack forever. It created some social element, it was kind like [inaudible 00:58:19] and this Discord, people learned so much about prompting and how to work with Claude. Actually, one of the features that was early tasks prototype is every Monday Claude would just summarize the entire channel. Or every Friday we'd just summarize a bunch of channels and give the news about the organization, or something. 

(00:58:48):
And it's kind of like really cool form factor. I think thinking about form factor's a really important question in AI, especially we haven't even figured out how do we create an awesome product experience with o-series models. It's like the paradigm between synchronous real time give an answer paradigm into more asynchronous paradigm of agents working on the background. But then now the question is the agents should build trust with you, right? And trust builds over time, which is like with humans. And you start this collaboration which is why this collaboration model with you and the model is so important because you build trust and the model learns from your preferences so that it can become more personalized and it will start predicting the next action that you want to take on the computer or something. And it's more predictive, much more... We went from personal computers to personal model basically here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):
Why is it not a thing? That seems like such an obvious feature that every LLM should have as a Slack bot version of them. Is that a thing I can help you install? Or is that not a thing right now?

Karina Nguyen (01:00:03):
I know that Claude and Slack was sunset in 2023 or something. I think it was after ChatGPT was mostly the focus on customer use cases or enterprise use cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):
Mm-hmm. Bummer. 

Karina Nguyen (01:00:19):
I think the form factor of Claude and Slack was kind of constrained a little bit when you want to talk about new features.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:28):
Bummer. I want that.

Karina Nguyen (01:00:30):
I know that ChatGPT had Slackbar tools. I don't know, maybe it will come back sometime.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:35):
All right, I would pay for that. Any other memories from that time of early days? Because that's a really special place to have been is early days Anthropic. Any other memories or stories from that time that might be interesting to share?

Karina Nguyen (01:00:48):
I think the very first launch when we felt... When click from use, again, was 100K context launch is when the models could input the entire book and give you a summary of the book or something. Or the financial... or catalog multi files financial reports and then give you an answer to the question, to very specific questions. I think there was something in there that was kind like, "Oh my god, this is a really cool new capability." Not model capability, but more like the capabilities that came from the product form factor itself rather than the model capability as much. 

(01:01:34):
I think other prototypes that we were thinking about... There's one part having a Claude workspaces and it's kind of the same idea of Claude and I would have this shared workspace and that share workspace is like a document and we can iterate on the document. And I feel like sometimes the ideas, [inaudible 01:01:55] and they're locked for two years, just like in this case. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):
It's interesting, there's these milestones that kind of open up our view of what is happening and where things are going. ChatGPT think was the first of just like, "Wow, this is much better than I would've thought." You talked about 100K context windows where you could upload a book and ask it questions and have it summarize. I actually use that all the time. When I have interview guests and they wrote a book, I sometimes don't have time to read the whole book. So I use it to help me understand what the most interesting parts are. And then I actually dive into the book, just to be clear. And then, I don't know, maybe voice was another one where you could talk to say ChatGPT. Is there any other moments there that you're like, "Wow, this is much better than I thought it was going to be?"

Karina Nguyen (01:02:39):
Yeah, I think the computer use agents, like the model operating the desktop. And you can essentially think of new kind of experience where the model can learn the way you browse. And from that preference it can just browse as just like you. It's kind of simulated persona. And it's actually very similar to the idea of like, "Okay, maybe Sam Altman doesn't have a lot of time. Maybe I want to talk to his simulation and ask..." Or, for example, I really appreciate some of the technical mentorship. Yeah, cool. But he doesn't have a lot of time so it's like I really want to ask him this questions. How do you respond with simulated environments like this would be really cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:37):
That's a great place to plug Lennybot, have one of those. It's trained on all of my podcasts and newsletters. 

Karina Nguyen (01:03:42):
Oh, cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):
It sits on many models. I don't know which exactly they use, but it's exactly that. And it's not even me, it's all the guests that have been on the podcast and on newsletter as I wrote. And you could just ask it, "How do I grow my product? How do I develop a strategy?" And it's actually shockingly good.

Karina Nguyen (01:03:58):
Do you feel like it reflects who you are?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
Yeah. 

Karina Nguyen (01:03:58):
Or would it be... Okay. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):
The best part of it is you can talk to it. There's an ElevenLabs voice version that's trained on my voice from this podcast, and it's actually very good and people have told me they sit there for hours talking to it. 

Karina Nguyen (01:04:15):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):
And somebody told it, "Interview me like I am on Lenny's podcast, ask me questions about my career." And he did a half hour podcast episode with Lennybot.

Karina Nguyen (01:04:24):
Oh my god, that's so fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:27):
It's incredible. Future is wild.

Karina Nguyen (01:04:29):
Yeah. I think content transformation is... I would imagine sometime when you generate a sci-fi story in Canvas, you can transform this into audiobook where you have very natural content transformation of one media to another media. I think one of my earliest inspiration is one of the last episodes of Westworld where, I don't want to spoil, but where Dolores comes to her work at that time and she comes to this new workspace and she starts writing a story. And then as she writes a story, a 3D, virtual reality, starts creating on the fly. So I kind of want to create that. Kind of cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):
Wow. Speaking of medium, I guess I was wondering if I should go in this direct or not, but real quick. Kevin Weill/Kevin Weill, I don't know exactly how to pronounce his last name, the CPO of OpenAI.

Karina Nguyen (01:05:35):
Kevin Weill, uh-huh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:37):
Is it Weill or Weill? 

Karina Nguyen (01:05:37):
I think Weill. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:39):
Weill. Okay. Okay. Let's just say that. We'll go with that. 

Karina Nguyen (01:05:40):
I hope, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):
He did a panel at the Lenny and Friends Summit last year and he made this really fascinating point that chat is a really interesting interface for these tools because they're just getting smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter. And chat continues to work as a paradigm to just interact with them, similar to a human. You could talk to Albert Einstein. You could talk to someone not very smart and it's all conversation still. And so it's a really flexible way to interact with increasingly good intelligence. At some point it'll not be so great, and you were talking about all these ways that you're adding additional ways to interact. But it's interesting chat proved to be a really powerful layer on top of all this stuff. 

Karina Nguyen (01:06:22):
Yeah, that's real cool. I feel like chat also has social element which is very humane. It's like, yeah, you sometimes want to get into group chat. And having conversations with AI is kind of like a group chat in itself, as messaging. Actually, this idea of how do you build features like this? I see tasks as this general feature that will scale very nicely as the models would develop new capabilities themselves. The models will be able to do better searches and create new... come up with more creative writing on render, react apps and like HTML apps. And you can have everyday new puzzle for you, every day continue the story from the previous days. It scales very nicely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:14):
You mentioned something as we were getting into this extra section that we ended up going down is this idea of the agents using a computer. I know this is actually something you are going to launch today, the day we're recording it, which will be out by the time this comes out, called Operator, can you talk about this very cool feature that people will have access to?

Karina Nguyen (01:07:33):
Yeah, so I unfortunately did not work on that, but I'm really, really excited about this launch. It's basically an agent that can complete the task in its own virtual computer, in its own virtual environment. You can do any literally task like order me a book on Amazon. And then ideally the model will either follow up with you which book do you want, or know you so well that it start recommending, "Oh, here is the five books that I might recommend you to buy." And then you hit, "Yeah, help me buy." And then the model goes off into its own virtual little browser and complete the task and buy the book on the Amazon. And then if you give the model credentials, credit cards, obviously it comes with a lot of trust and safety, then it will just complete the thing for you. It's a virtual assistant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:37):
It's interesting how this just sounds like obviously this should happen. Why is this not yet a thing? Which is also mind-blowing that we're just assuming this should exist. Just some AI doing things for you on a computer we just ask it to do. 

Karina Nguyen (01:08:37):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):
It's absurd.

Karina Nguyen (01:08:51):
It's actually really hard. And I think you're still cracking this, but feel like... I don't know if you use Tuple like a pair programming product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
No.

Karina Nguyen (01:09:04):
But at Anthropic we loved pair programming, so if you used-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):
Oh yeah, Shopify uses this. I remember it came up on a podcast episode.

Karina Nguyen (01:09:10):
Oh, nice. Yeah, so it is a very cool product where you can just call anyone at any time and then share screen and the other person can have access to the screen or start literally operating your computer. And it's very realtime... The allegiance is very... it's very high quality. And it's just like I kind of want the same. I want to pair program with my model and the model should even talk to me. Draw very specific section in my code and just go to tell me... Obviously teach me and we can have different modes. It's like right, this is a product right here for you. I don't know. Some people should build that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:58):
It sounds like a startup just got birthed-

Karina Nguyen (01:09:59):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:00):
... from someone listening to this. You mentioned that it's very hard to do this agent controlling a computer as you and helping out. What makes it so hard for whatever, however much you can explain briefly?

Karina Nguyen (01:10:11):
Much of it is because right now the model's operating on pixels instead of language or whatnot. Pixels is actually really, really hard. The models [inaudible 01:10:25] perception, or visual perception. I think there's still a lot of multimodal research that's going on, but I think language scaled so much easier compared to multimodal because of that.

(01:10:38):
Another thing that I guess my team is working that is how do you derive human intent very correctly? It's like sometimes does the model know enough information to ask a follow-up question or to complete the task? You don't want an agent to go off for 10 minutes and then come back with an answer that you didn't even want. That actually creates much more worse user experience. And this comes with teaching the model people skills. It's like, "What do people like? Kind of like creating the mental model of the user and care about the user in order to ask certain questions. Actually, that part is hard to do for the models.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):
That relates to what we talked about earlier where this kind of the soft skill, people skills piece is not where these models are strong yet.

Karina Nguyen (01:11:34):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):
Okay. I'm going to skip the lightning round. I want to ask just one question from the lightning round, something fun. 

Karina Nguyen (01:11:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
Okay, so when AI replaces your job, Karina, I'm curious what you're... And it gives you a stipend, gives you a monthly stipend. Here's your salary for the month. What would you want to do? What do you want to spend your time on? What will you be doing in this future world?

Karina Nguyen (01:11:57):
I've been thinking about this a lot times. I feel like I have a lot of jobs options. I would love to be a writer, I think. I think that would be super cool. You should write short stories, sci-fi stories, novels. I really like art history, so you know those conservationists in the museums who just try to preserve art paintings, but just painting through a long day? 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:28):
Mm-hmm. 

Karina Nguyen (01:12:29):
I think that would be really cool to do. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:36):
That sounds beautiful.

Karina Nguyen (01:12:36):
I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
What I'm hearing is you need to Nerf these models to not get very good at writing so that you can continue... Although at that point you don't need to do it from... You don't need people to buy it, you're just doing it for fun, so it doesn't even matter if they're incredibly good at writing or art conservation. Oh man, what an episode of our conversation. What a wild time we're living in. Karina, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Karina Nguyen (01:13:06):
You can find me, I'm on Twitter it's KarinaNguyen. You can also shoot me an email on my website. And my team is hiring and so I'm looking for research engineers, research scientists, as well as machine learning engineers, people who come from product engineers who want to learn model training. I'm actually hiring for my team. My team is called Frontier Product Research, and we train models, we develop new methods but for product oriented outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:38):
What a place to work. Holy moly. What's the best way for people to apply for these very lucrative roles?

Karina Nguyen (01:13:46):
I think you can shoot me a DM on Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
Okay. 

Karina Nguyen (01:13:51):
Or I'm yet to create a job description for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:51):
Okay. This is the job description.

Karina Nguyen (01:13:58):
Or you can apply into post training team. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:58):
Okay. You're going to get a flood of DMs. I hope you're prepared. Karina, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.

Karina Nguyen (01:14:03):
Thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):
Bye, everyone. 

Karina Nguyen (01:14:05):

# Building beautiful products with Stripe’s Head of Design | Katie Dill (Stripe, Airbnb, Lyft)

## Transcript

Katie Dill (00:00:00):
The use of the word beauty in books that have been digitized by Google has decreased, like pretty dramatically. And it's aligned with this idea of, "Well, functionality is king. Functionality is what matters." As if people think about functionality and beauty as like two opposite things. No, they're not two opposite things. Functionality is important. And actually beauty enhances functionality because it does make things easier to use, more approachable, more compelling to use.

(00:00:32):
And the other piece of it that is not talked about in business as often is just the importance of how people feel. Things that are more beautiful, increase trust. You see that we've put painstaking detail into this, and we care about the details of how something works, and that gives you assurance that we care about other details that you can't see too.

Lenny (00:00:55):
Today my guest is Katie Dill. Katie is Head of Design at Stripe, where she oversees product design, brand and marketing creative, web presence, user research, content strategy, and design ops. Katie was previously Head of Design at Lyft, and Head of Experience Design at Airbnb. She's built and led design teams at three different hypergrowth companies, seen the teams scale at least 10x, and two of which, Airbnb and Stripe, are some of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world and also the best designed products.

(00:01:25):
In our conversation Katie shares stories of trials and tribulations of leading large design teams, processes she's put in place for operationalizing quality, how she thinks about quality and beauty very practically, how design can directly lead to growth, and examples of this that led to a big lift in conversion at Stripe, plus a math formula she uses to increase team performance, how she suggests organizing your design and product teams, what to look for in design hires, and so much more. I was really lucky to get to work with Katie while at Airbnb, and I am so excited to have her on this podcast. With that, I bring you Katie Dill after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:05):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career, and something that worked really well for me a few years ago, is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.

(00:02:29):
This has been a big trajectory changer for me. But it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly-vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:02:53):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today?

(00:03:14):
Jump the growing waitlist of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more. That's sidebar.com/lenny. You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

(00:03:42):
A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets.

Katie Dill (00:04:52):
Thanks for having me. Good to be here.

Lenny (00:04:54):
It's absolutely my pleasure. So as we were preparing for this podcast, you hinted at a story that you had from your time at Airbnb where the design team staged an intervention with you which I had no idea about. Because I was there during this time and I did not know this was happening. I am so curious to hear the story. Can you share what happened?

Katie Dill (00:05:15):
Ah, starting with the easy questions I see. All right.

Lenny (00:05:18):
Right into it.

Katie Dill (00:05:20):
Yeah. No, I'm happy to talk about it because, frankly, it was the biggest learning experience of my leadership career, or at least that happened in one moment. It happened in my early days at Airbnb. I was hired to take on the Design Organization, or the Experience Design Organization. That's basically the Product Design team, which was 10 people at the time. They had been reporting directly to one of the founders and they were going to start reporting to me.

(00:05:47):
During my interview process I learned a lot about what was working, and what wasn't working, and some of the trials and tribulations with the Design Organization and its collaboration with others. So it seemed like there was room for improvement in how Engineering, and Product Management, and Design all worked together. There was also really low engagement scores in the Design team.

(00:06:08):
So I kind of came in ready to go and excited to try to help make some change based on all the things that I had learned from various leaders and people across the company. I came in swinging, ready to go. And then about a month into my time there, I got a meeting on my calendar, Thursday 8:30 AM, it was an hour and a half with half of the Design team, so that was five people, and our HR partner.

Lenny (00:06:38):
Oh, no.

Katie Dill (00:06:38):
Usually not a good sign.

Lenny (00:06:38):
That's never a good sign.

Katie Dill (00:06:40):
Yeah. And I remember this so vividly. I remember walking into the office, and all the rooms in Airbnb's office are very unique spaces that look like Airbnb's. But of course this was the one room with all white walls and just a gray flat rectangle table. I walked into the room and there were five of them seated around the table. They had a pack of papers in front of them and they went on taking turns quietly reading from the papers all the things that they saw that I was doing wrong and all the things that they didn't like about me.

(00:07:22):
It was a really hard moment there. I went through all the usual kind of like stages of grief when one hears feedback, which is just like an immediate want to respond to be like, "Yeah." Like, "Well there was a good reason for that." And like, "That's not how it actually was." And, "This is why I did that." But luckily, thank goodness I had the sense to just listen and not respond in that way. I mean, clearly what they were telling me is that that was one of the things that was missing.

(00:07:49):
So I heard them out and took it all in. And regardless of each individual saying, what was very clear was that the missing piece, the theme that was across all of that, is that I hadn't earned their trust. So whether how right or how wrong what I was doing was, is the key piece is that I wasn't bringing the team along with me. They had no idea that they could trust in what I was trying to build, and what I was trying to shape, and that I cared about them, and that I had their best interests and shared goals at heart. And that was absolutely my fault.

(00:08:24):
In retrospect, as hard as that was, I'm very grateful and very amazed that they could come together and share that with me. It can be hard to bring feedback forward like that. So it was an extremely valuable learning experience. I took from that to then immediately shift how I was operating. And really a key part in building trust was to listen, to hear out what the individuals on the team were setting out to do, what they cared about, what motivated them.

(00:08:57):
So I started to make pretty fast change and still moving in the direction that was necessary for the org to make the really large impact in how we were operating, but bringing folks along with me. You can inflict change on people, but if you want to do it with them trust is the key element there. And then a couple months later, we had the best engagement scores in the company.

(00:09:20):
So it did objectively improve the situation, and since then taken that on into next steps in other companies that I've joined. And just think about instead of coming in swinging, come in listening, so that you can really set out to make change that actually has true, positive impact on the folks around you and that you bring along with you.

Lenny (00:09:42):
Wow, I was there during this. I did not know this was happening. Is this the time when all the designers were all always in one room together in Thayer? Is that that period?

Katie Dill (00:09:52):
Before I got there I think there was a little of like, "Design is just going to sit with Design and not necessarily work in close proximity with engineers and product managers, et cetera." And one of the things that I believe as a necessary part of building a high-functioning organization is that, one, building together is important. So having engineers, and product managers, and designers be together, have shared goals, and align on that and be able to just look over each other's shoulder and talk about things, is important. So sitting together is important.

(00:10:21):
However, that Thayer thing that you're talking about actually was like something that I was very devoted to, which is bringing Design together at key moments multiple times throughout the week to also build a community in Design. Like Joebot at Airbnb once said, "It's like, well, what T-shirt do you wear? What team are you on?" And I was like, "You have two T-shirts. You have the Design T-shirt and you have the Marketplace T-shirt, or whatever cross-disciplinary team that you work on. Because both are really important communities to build for slightly different reasons." So yeah, Thayer was a good spot for that.

Lenny (00:10:56):
Zooming out a little bit, I think the elephant in the room a lot of times with design is this idea that I'd say most PMs, most founders, intellectually understand the value of design, understand the value of high quality. But day-to-day it's often not actually prioritized versus new features, new product launches, partly because the ROI is just really unclear.

(00:11:16):
If we spend another month making this more awesome and making this even more amazing design-wise, experience-wise, what is that going to get us? Clearly, at Airbnb design was highly prioritized. At Stripe, from an outsider's perspective, it clearly is. I'm just curious what you've learned about how to make the case for the ROI of design and just how Stripe, and Airbnb, and Lyft have done that.

Katie Dill (00:11:39):
It's a great question, and I think this is like an age-old question that I don't know if will ever go away, and probably because the quality bar keeps evolving, keeps rising. But I think first to kind of level set before we dive into that I would say that there are levels of quality. There is the, does the thing work? Does it provide some sort of value proposition? It like executes on its job. That's baseline quality.

(00:12:06):
Next is that, does it do it exceedingly well? Is it error-free? Actually, maybe that's not even exceedingly well but just error-free and it actually works in a well-rounded way. Then beyond that, like level three, level four, level five, does it exceed expectations and it does something that you weren't even seeking for as a user? And I do think the levels of quality should be based on user expectations. I don't believe that there are disciplines that just don't care about quality.

(00:12:36):
I think it's more about that prioritization and kind of like what you talked about is just like, is it really worth getting something to that exceedingly well state or is it, what about just like another feature and being seduced by the chase of another feature versus actually taking your features to a level of being great? That is hard. And I get it when you look at your user base and they're all shouting from the rooftops for this additional feature.

(00:13:05):
Of course you're going to want to prioritize that over something they never asked for. Then the other thing would be you end up with like you've got three things that you could possibly do to make perhaps the next stage in your product development. Two of them you know you can measure and they're going to line up to business goals, and one of them you can't.

(00:13:21):
Of course that's going to be enchanting to want to go after the things that you can actually measure, you know that they're going to have that impact. But the companies that know that quality is non-negotiable, it is a long-term necessary aspect of what they build, don't play that numbers game. Or what they do is they recognize that it is absolutely functionality, but the quality of those features that is actually going to get to great usability, desirability in their product.

(00:13:53):
Actually, I think it's kind of like an analogy for going to the gym or working out. I don't know about you, but literally every time I think to do this, there's a fight in my head of like, "Ah, do I really need to work out today? Is this one day going to give me six-pack abs?" Like, "Of course not." So like, "Why go? Why not just skip it today?" But of course then at some point, hopefully, I realize that it's like, "Well, if I skip it today, what's to stop me from skipping it another day?"

(00:14:21):
And really in the belief of that these things, it really does add up to a better outcome in the end, and so a longer, healthier life. So hopefully I can get myself together and go to the gym. I do think some of the best companies on the planet think that way. I recognize that customers don't always ask for it. I mean, you might see it in support cases for example. Like clearly they don't know how to use this next step and that is probably a quality issue and that they might be asking for in more improved features.

(00:14:53):
But some of the levels of quality, the level two, and three, and four, you might not get direct asked for. But I guess I'll give you another analogy. If you don't have competition, that's fine. Right? If you think about the first car, I am sure that wheel was really hard to turn, and I'm sure that seat was not comfortable, and you could have any color you want as long as it's black. Right? But there was no competition. The competition was a horse, so no big deal. For cars today it's like the stitching, the choice of the leather, the sound of the door.

(00:15:28):
These distinguish a, hmm, okay car to a high-end special car with higher value. This is very much by understanding how the details matter and how execution of quality will take it to the next level. Lastly, I'll just say that I know there's this saying of it's growth versus quality, but quality is growth. And if you think about how you can make your product easier to use and more understandable, that will of course drive people to use it, and use more of it, and have a better experience with it that they'll want to talk about with others.

(00:16:08):
In fact, at Stripe our Growth team I would say is pretty much maniacally focused on building better experiences because we've seen it tied directly to our business metrics. We have things that we've improved on in our onboarding flow, for example, to make it easier to understand the products, understand how they work for your different use cases such that then we have seen activations increase because we've made these quality improvements that are just directly tied to growth.

(00:16:38):
One of the biggest examples that I've seen of business impact through quality is actually in the checkout experience. We've done research on the checkout experience in some of the top e-commerce sites. We found that 99% of the top e-commerce sites have errors in their checkout flow that actually hinder more impactful, more seamless, quicker checkout, and therefore higher conversion with their customers. These small things, really they're quality issues.

(00:17:14):
They're just that if you really understand what a consumer is trying to get out of the experience, then you can make it better. So we have been maniacally focused on that over many years, trying to make the checkout experience so much better for businesses and their consumers. So by improving the quality of the checkout experience through details small and large, we have seen a 10.5% increase in business' revenue from an older form of checkout to a newer form of checkout. And those little details matter to have such a material impact on one's revenue.

Lenny (00:17:51):
You mentioned this before we started recording, but you guys power the checkout flow for some very big sites. Can you mention a few of these because they'll give people a sense of like holy moly.

Katie Dill (00:18:00):
Yeah. Stripe is used by millions of businesses globally, small and large, from early stage startups, to SMBs, larger organizations and enterprises like Amazon and Hertz, Shopify, Spotify, X, which I believe you use. The work that we do, it ranges.

(00:18:20):
We have checkout flows, so when someone's paying online, or in person, or we also provide a suite of financial automation tools so that you can run your subscriptions business, and recognize your revenue, and receive tax, and essentially manage the complexity of the financial space through powerful tools that hope to make your job easier so you don't have to sweat the details of how these things work.

Lenny (00:18:46):
I just want to follow this thread a little bit. You talked about these opportunities to improve the checkout flow through a design lens. You could also think of it from like as a product manager I'd be like, "Oh wow. Let's just find all the things that people get stuck on and fix them." How is it that you see that from the quality design perspective versus like, "Oh, let's just move this metric and here's all the things that are stopping people." What would you say is the designer's lens on that, if there's anything there?

Katie Dill (00:19:13):
Honestly, a pet peeve of mine is this way of talking about things as there's business goals and there's design goals. Because I think maybe the first conversation one should have is that, "What are we trying to build towards?" And I would think that folks that want to create really impactful products, they want to create quality products, and that they want to create things that actually serve their customers in a positive and beneficial way because they know that will build a stronger business in the long run.

(00:19:47):
So yes, there may be slight prioritization details different through the process where a designer might be thinking more about the emotional experience and how somebody feels, because that's oftentimes how they're wired, and that is an important lens to bring on it. Whereas somebody else might just be like, "Well, just make the button bigger and they'll click it more often, and that's the outcome that we seek."

(00:20:10):
So this is, again, why I was talking about how important it is to have multidisciplinary teams that work closely together because sometimes we are the checks and balances in the conversation. But I do think if we can align on what are we trying to build? Are we trying to build something great, then we can recognize the fact that it isn't just that utility is an incredible important part of that, but so is usability and so is desirability because these things together make something truly great.

(00:20:38):
So beauty is an important part of that because it does make things more useful, it does make things more accessible, and that with these things kind of coming together you can build towards something better. I think that beauty on its own or just craft on its own without utility, I mean that's like, I don't know, that's like Blu-ray or PATH. Right? That does not lead to a high-quality product. So it is the combination of these things, and so it's like stepping towards that.

(00:21:10):
But if you really want your product, those features, to be utilized for all that they're worth and to actually gain such esteem, and respect, and reuse, taking it to that next level and thinking about, "How do I make this actually an enjoyable use and that it really feels like it's meant for me and it maps my mental model," that craft and that quality of the execution of those details is going to be paramount.

Lenny (00:21:40):
You mentioned this word beauty, and I wanted to follow on this a little bit of just ... This is a big question, but just what is great design? What is beauty? Is there like a objective definition where if a designer is like, "This is great design," is there just like, "Yes, that is true." Or is it just an opinion? How do you think about what is great design? What is beauty, Katie Dill?

Katie Dill (00:21:59):
I love that we're talking about this because I feel like there's probably some people listening that are squirming in their seats. Of like, "Beauty? We're talking about business here." Which is great. Actually, there's a fun fact. Stefan Sagmeister and Jessica Walsh have a book called Beauty. I would highly recommend it. Very, very worth the read. But one of the first things they talk about in the book is that from the 1800s to the 2000s the use of the word beauty in books that have been digitized by Google has decreased pretty dramatically.

(00:22:34):
It's aligned with this idea of like, "Well, functionality is king. Functionality is what matters," as if people think about functionality and beauty as like two opposite things. But what the whole book talks about is that like, "No, they're not two opposite things." Functionality is important, and actually beauty enhances functionality because it does make things easier to use, more approachable, more compelling to use. And there is actually some objectivity to whether or not beauty enhances things.

(00:23:05):
But if you ask a wide audience what color do they like more or what version of things do they like more, they tend to say the same thing because there is this shared understanding. The other piece of it that yes I can imagine is not talked about in business as often is just the importance of how people feel. A good example of how something looks, and how something is structured, and how that can translate to that, also from the book Beauty, they mentioned that they studied the tweets that came from people that were traveling through Penn Station versus Grand Central.

(00:23:43):
If you've been to those places I'm sure where I'm going with this, which is just like the people tweeting from Penn Station, it was just like more negative than the people that were tweeting from Grand Central Station that tended to be much more positive and optimistic. So the things that you create have this impact. And if you're thinking about like, "I want people to enjoy using my-

Katie Dill (00:24:00):
... have this impact. If you're thinking about, "I want people to enjoy using my product, I want them to feel at home in our product." Of course, beauty is a part of it, and this matters deeply to us, and I know, as a financial infrastructure company in the B2B space, some may assume that that doesn't matter as much, but it's actually a key priority for us. Because, number one, things that are more beautiful, increase trust. You see that we've put painstaking detail into this and we care about the details of how something works, and that gives you assurance that we care about other details that you can't see too.

(00:24:37):
Then, secondly, it is easier to use, as I've mentioned, it gives better user outcomes. What we're trying to do is we're trying to equip businesses to make the right decisions to be more successful at what they do. By bringing a interface or our invoices, or whatever it might be, to be more beautiful, and more easy to use, and more trustworthy, that will lead them to better outcomes. Thirdly, I strongly believe beauty begets beauty. When our business users or the consumers see the beauty and the care and the creativity that we put into things we deliver, then that again reassures them of just the care that we put into them. Actually, a perfect example of this, have you seen the show The Bear?

Lenny (00:25:23):
I have, yes. Great example. Yeah.

Katie Dill (00:25:25):
All right. Okay. All right. No spoilers, but all I have to say is peeling mushrooms. Do you know what I mean?

Lenny (00:25:30):
Yeah.

Katie Dill (00:25:30):
Yeah. Such a good example. Such a good example.

Lenny (00:25:33):
Someone just mentioned that same episode on a recent podcast episode.

Katie Dill (00:25:36):
Okay. All right. Well, it's that good. It's that good. I wish I could remember which episode that was, but it was seven? I forget. But anyway.

Lenny (00:25:44):
Yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly right.

Katie Dill (00:25:45):
Oh, nice. Okay. All right. Well, and then lastly, quality is a matter of pride, beauty is a matter of pride. If we put that care into our work, more people will want to work with us, because they want to see their time spent and the care for their craft recognized and utilized and see that that can be put together into something really impactful. We really put that on the pedestal, because we know how much it matters to our users and then how much it matters to the people that work with us. Beauty is an important part of it all.

Lenny (00:26:20):
Amazing. Speaking of beauty, when I think of Stripe and beautiful, I think of your website, and some of the specific landing pages you have, which are just incredibly nice. I'm just curious how you decide it's time to redesign your website and how much time and thought you put into a new website. Because that feels like a common question founders have, "Should we redo our website?" And it feels like you guys really think deeply about that. So, I guess is there anything there that you can share?

Katie Dill (00:26:45):
Yeah, there's definitely a couple of things we could talk about in terms of operationalizing quality. Because the gravitational pull is to mediocrity. It is very easy to fall into a path of a baseline, where what is required to go to that next level where something feels truly great is certainly a lot of effort, and it's a concerted effort. I will definitely say we are a work in progress and we have not nailed all the things and it is an ongoing pursuit of excellence.

(00:27:21):
The way that we build the website is that we certainly do put a lot of care into what we're putting out into the world, and we view it as a articulation of how we care about our users in all that we provide for them. So, we take that very seriously. We try to meld art and science. So, it's the creativity of the work, but it's also just the technical power of the way that we show it.

(00:27:49):
How we've actually operationalized the way we do that is that we have design and engineering and our product partners and product marketing work really, really closely on this. Actually, it's one of the few teams where all of these things report, well, not all of them, but most of those functions report into one place. So, engineering and design actually all report up into the design organization when they work on the website. Together, quite literally, as we were talking about earlier, if we were physically together, they would be sitting side by side and they're batting ideas back and forth, because the engineer on the team has a great idea for how we could go about executing on it. And the designer on the team has another idea how to push that a little further. So, that rapid cycle of iteration is really, really powerful, especially when we're trying to move quickly, but at an extremely high standard.

Lenny (00:28:44):
That's super interesting. Is there anything else that you've found to be really helpful in just operationalizing great design, craft, beauty, any processes, systems, frameworks?

Katie Dill (00:28:54):
Yeah, I would love to tell you about something that we've actually rolled out pretty recently that I'm extremely excited about the positive impact on.

Lenny (00:29:02):
Awesome.

Katie Dill (00:29:02):
But before I get into that, one of the things that has been driving a little bit of this process and the way that I've been thinking about how we can build better things at Stripe is actually I've been just talking to people, talking to different design leaders, product leaders, engineer leaders at different organizations and trying to understand how they go about it. There are a couple of themes that are clearly coming through.

(00:29:28):
Number one is that quality is definitely a group effort. You're sunk if you think that you can just hire some incredibly talented person and they'll do it, that'll be fine. The rest of us will do what we're doing and they'll do it, or that it's just one organization that's going to look out for quality or QA is going to solve it all for you. It really does need to be an organizational and a group effort. If you think about the way that you run the internal functions is going to show up in the outside and how clear you all are and how you're talking about it and the standards that you set inside and you're constantly reminding people of in the way that you communicate inside will then eventually show up outside. So, of course, keeping your talent bar high and then thinking about how those things really need to be cared for, that shared care across the organization is number one.

(00:30:20):
Number two is that there needs to be some amount of vision and alignment. So, if you hire all the best people in the world and you just set them out to go and do their thing, what are the chances that they're all going to end up with something that actually aligns pretty well? Even if they all have incredible taste and they're very good at what they do, there is subjectivity to every decision in some part. So, that they might end up with some things that are really great but don't fit together as a really nice whole.

(00:30:49):
The perfect example would be building a house. You have the person that works on the roof and the person that works on the deck and the person that does the siding, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A house is arguably far less complex than most of the technical products that we all know. Yet, there is painstaking effort put into having the plans and having a drawing of what the final thing is going to look like. There's a GC, there's an architect. And these people are helping to make sure that all those pieces fit together, and we should have that same care when we're trying to build products together.

(00:31:19):
I think a big pair on that is then the next piece, which is editing. And you might call that your GC or your architect or somebody that sees how all these things fit together, and then has an ability to help narrow and reduce and remove the things that don't fit. At Airbnb, Brian Chesky is the editor of all the things that come together. At the Economist, there's a chief editor. But other organizations, they might decentralize that approach, which is certainly possible, but challenging, because you do need somebody to help see these things come together.

(00:31:53):
That pairs with the next piece, which is about courage, the ability to actually say, "No, this isn't good enough." To have the resolve to just be like, "Almost, but no." Which is one of the hardest decisions I think leaders can make and certainly I've had to ever make in my career, too, is just a team puts all this care and effort into something and then you're going to say, "Actually, unfortunately we're just not there yet. Let's try again." That is, I think, incredibly important part of getting there and building the fitness of what you do.

(00:32:28):
Then, lastly, the thing that I've learned that will lead me to the example that you were asking about is that, in order to build quality, you really do need to understand it also from the user perspective, which gets me into my fixation with journeys, because that is how a user sees it. The user very, very, very rarely just deals with any aspect of what you build in isolation. There has to be a moment where they learn about it. There has to be a moment where they get to know it, and then there's a moment where they actually decide to use it, and then something just changed and now they need to use that product in some other way. You have to understand it from that point of view to really understand whether or not the quality is there. I think that's a critical piece of building teams that have empathy for their users.

(00:33:16):
So, we have been operationalizing that. All the things that I just mentioned, but one of the key pieces is to bring that approach to understanding the quality of the product. So, our goal was to set out to try to solve the fact that products can be shipped and they could be at their highest game when you ship them, they go through all the processes internally to be a high quality thing, and then it gets out into the world and then, over time, the quality regresses. Some of the reasons for that is that other things are being shipped. It's kind of like, again, back to an analogy of a house, imagine you have one room where you redo the molding and you paint the little aspects and you've put new plates on the lights, now all of a sudden that room is great, but it makes everything else look worse and the whole composite is worse.

(00:34:10):
That is something that can happen to products is actually they get worse over time. Then you organize a company oftentimes and parts to be able to focus on their key business areas. That's a very good thing because they get focused and they know what they're building towards and they get expertise and they're laser focused on that. So, ideally, they move faster. But what also happens is that they get so focused on that they forget about that piece of the journey, and how it all fits together, and not recognizing that part of their product experience is intimately tied to another.

(00:34:44):
So, what we did was we set out to, number one, increase the kind of awareness and accountability of leaders to own their journeys. What we have established are we started with 15 of our most important user journeys. 15 is somewhat of an arbitrary number. It's a number that we can kind of keep track of, but also has pretty good breadth, but is certainly not comprehensive of all the most important things. But 15 of our critical user journeys, the things that we know matter so deeply to our users, and we must get right at the highest level of quality possible.

(00:35:20):
Those 15 things then each have engineering, product and design leaders that are responsible for the quality of those products. They review these journeys, what we call walk the store, where they review them as if they're walking the floor of their store on a regular cadence, and they friction log what they experience, which I know David Singleton talked about on your podcast. They will write what they have seen, what's working, what's not working. They're viewing this from, they're trying to put themselves in the shoes of their user. This of course doesn't replace user research, but it substitutes it and it adds to that.

(00:35:58):
So, they go through the experience and noting what's working and what's not working. And very critically, it's a journey, so a lot of times it starts from internet search, it starts on Google trying to understand something, goes to the website, they end up on Docs, they end up in the dashboard, and they're seeing it as a user might. With that, they're able to find the entailments of the experience that may or may not be working. They jot that down, they file bugs, they reach out to the teams that may own the different parts of this experience, and then they score it. Then on, again, a regular cadence, we come together in almost like a calibration, where we meet and we talk about the score of their work.

(00:36:40):
It relates to performance reviews. Performance reviews, managers are assessing an individual's performance, which is hard. There's some subjectivity to it, just like understanding quality can be. But what we do as managers is we calibrate. We come together and we talk about, "Okay, how well is our interpretation of our ladders document? And how well does that performance align? And are we doing it consistently across the rest of the organization?" So, we do something very similar. We calibrate these scores because what we're really trying to do is not just the 15 essential journeys and the owners of those, we want to actually uplevel and bring more shared understanding of our quality bar across the company. These moments of calibration start that. Then having leaders do this creates this, number one, it cascades this idea of the importance of owning your journey and then also has upstream impact.

(00:37:43):
Because when people see the state of products in the wild as a user would, they learn a lot about what are some of the bigger opportunities that we can make to make the product better? What are some of the things that maybe we want to change in our process to make sure that we have even better things coming into the wild? One of the best parts of this is, since then we've learned that folks have seen that like, "Oh my goodness, our SEO for this particular product or the way we're articulating it doesn't align to actually how we want people to understand it later on in the journey. So if we improve this over here, we're going to improve outcomes later on." They're seeing that and they're now able to make that happen even faster to make some of the changes there.

(00:38:27):
Then my real favorite part is that we're hearing from folks that maybe at first didn't see this as necessary, that maybe in different functions that are just like, "Oh, I was so very focused on executing the technical ability of what I do on this thing, but I hadn't seen it from this lens before." Now there're actually converts of like, "Yes, this is a really important part of it." That goes back to the point of it's a group effort. You don't want just one function looking out for the quality of the product. So, having engineers and product managers and people of different disciplines walking the store, seeing the experience, feeling it firsthand, I think will lead to better care in all of the details that will aligned to better craft in the end.

Lenny (00:39:12):
Oh man, what an awesome process. I have a million questions I want to ask to better understand how you operationalize this. I'll try to ask just a few. But one thing that stood out about this process is I think people kind of don't trust their own judgment when they're looking at their own product. They kind of, especially product managers, almost have to feel like they have to rely on user research or data to know a thing versus like, "I just see this and it feels bad to me." I think I've learned over time more and more that you should really trust that, because you're spending your energy trying to use this thing, you're not that different from a potential user. So, I love that this actually relies on your personal judgment trying to use a thing, which I think people undervalue.

Katie Dill (00:39:53):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:39:54):
A couple of just very tactical questions, how often roughly does this happen? Is it once a quarter?

Katie Dill (00:40:00):
To your first point, 100%, they're all just forms of input. I'm definitely not saying do this instead of user research, do this instead of data. It's like these things in additional sense. I do think what's so powerful about doing it firsthand is that, although I am the biggest supporter of user research, even hearing somebody talk about an experience, while that is really, really powerful, feeling the pain firsthand is just this next level of visceral understanding of like, "Oh, this could be better." Your users, they might not always say what's missing or what's wrong, or maybe they don't know that certain aspects of it could be better. Yeah, having your point of view on that in addition to the user research and what you've heard from them directly is really, really important.

(00:40:49):
But you asked about how often. We have, as I've mentioned, we are constantly looking at our processes and trying to figure out how we can make them better and better as an organization, as we've grown, things need to adjust. We today are doing it quarterly. The quarterly aspect of walking the stores by no means meant to be like that's the only time people do it. But that is the time where we're looking for update your scorecard and share the information in a dashboard where everybody can see. That is feeling right now to be the right cadence because that's enough time that there can be material differences made. You can see the scores evolve over time. But also frequently enough that you're not missing that perhaps there's been a setback since. But, of course, my real hope is that they're happening weekly, just perhaps in different parts of the organization.

Lenny (00:41:46):
I want to ask a couple more questions so that folks can try this at home. I was just thinking this podcast is the opposite of don't try this at home. It's like, "Here, try this at home?"

Katie Dill (00:41:54):
Try it at home.

Lenny (00:41:55):
Yeah. So, I want to try to give people a few more answers to questions when they're probably going to try to do this themselves. Who's in these meetings? Do you join these walkthroughs? Does David join? What do you suggest there?

Katie Dill (00:42:07):
Yeah. For what we're doing for each team is they do them themselves together. At bare minimum, it should be the engineer, product manager and designer doing it together. The reason why we like to see it happen together is, again, as we've talked about before, is that people bring a different perspective to something. Let's say somebody in the room might be like, "Oh my goodness, the load time didn't feel really good there." And like, "Oh, whoa, the way we're stating this is not consistent per page. And that's not on our design system."

(00:42:41):
So, it is really powerful to have folks come together and do it. In fact, David Singleton, who you mentioned, he and I do these things very regularly, too. This is outside the essential journeys program, but he and I walk the store and we'll just pick random flows and go through it together. I can't code, but he can. So, he'll do the code part and I'll be sitting there being, "What? Do they really do that? How can we make that better for them?"

(00:43:08):
I really love the multidisciplinary approach, but then when we do the calibration after the team has done these walkthroughs and they've gotten their own perspective and they fill out the scorecard based on our rubric for quality, we will come together in what we call PQR, product quality review. And they will take us through what they have experienced, and then they'll talk about, "So, this is why we've scored this, a yellow or a yellow green." Then we might have a conversation about that.

(00:43:39):
It's like, "Well, actually, that felt a little worse than you've described it. Actually, I think that we probably need to put more urgency on solving that." Or in some cases it's like, "Actually, that was pretty great. If you think about what we're trying to help somebody achieve at this moment that actually is really hitting the mark."

(00:43:59):
We will debate that there. In those meetings you'll have, yes, myself, David Singleton, Will Gaybrick, who leads product and business, and then various leaders from the organization that might be relevant to that area. We are trying to give people insight to what's happening across. Again, it's a multidisciplinary room. I'm trying to keep it not too large, because obviously it can be hard to have discussion, but it is very valuable to make sure, again, that we have the perspective of product marketing and the perspective of engineering, the expected product in the room as we discuss what our quality bar is.

Lenny (00:44:36):
Awesome. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. In terms of scoring, are you scoring individual steps of these journeys or is it yellow for segments? What are you scoring?

Katie Dill (00:44:44):
The way the rubric works is so that, and we have a template for the friction log. So, people fill out a friction log and it'll be screenshots and then what they experienced. Then there is a tool to tag for each moment. It's like, "Oh, that was a nice touch." Or, "Ooh, that is not great. We should consider a fix." Or different levels of severity of like, "Oh my gosh, P0 bug, we need to fix this right now." So, they'll tag for different moments in the journey.

(00:45:11):
Then there is a summary score at the end, which is based on a rubric that we have that talks about the importance of quality from the point of view of usability, utility, desirability, and actually going to that next level of surprisingly great. Then we'll ask them to score on a whole what they felt of these things. Then that adds up to a summary score. Which we have also talked about the different ways of scoring. Is it a number-based system? Is it a letter-based system? Like A-minus and B?

Lenny (00:45:42):
[inaudible 00:45:42].

Katie Dill (00:45:42):
Yeah. So far we have landed on a color system because, honestly, I think people can get a little tied around the axle on how you're measuring it, and to your point, especially in subjective things, and it's just like, "Oh, it's like, well, is it really a six or is it a seven?" We didn't want people to get a little too worried about how does... It's not meant to be an objective quantitative score. It is qualitative, it is judgment. We hire people for judgment, so we want them to bring that to the conversation. That's how we chose the score, because we felt that would actually lead to quicker but straightforward opinions and decisions.

Lenny (00:46:25):
At a lot of companies, you have these reviews and the founders share all this like, "Oh, this is broken, this is busted." And as a product team, you're like, "Goddammit, we have these goals we got to hit. We have this roadmap. And now we're going to get a hundred things that the founder's like, 'Got to fix this.'" I'm curious just how you tell teams to take this stuff and prioritize it amongst all the other things they're going to do. Is it just up to them, is they're like, "Need to fix this"? Anything you can share there, but just how to actually operationalize taking this feedback and doing something with it?

Katie Dill (00:46:54):
Yes. Yeah. I've seen some organizations talk about when they're doing planning, you do your OKRs quarterly or half year or year, whatever, recommendations of like, 10% of your time should be spent on fixing things, and 20% on growing things, and the rest on keeping the lights on, whatever it might be. Yes, I've seen different companies build a recommendation based on certain percentages of how they think teams should be spending their time.

(00:47:28):
We at Stripe think that, first and foremost, is that we have to make sure that folks are, number one, hired with the fact that they have great judgment and care for what they build, and they take pride in it. That's number one. Then, you can give a lot of trust to people based on that commitment to building great things that they will use that in their decision-making. Then, of course, it needs to be very clearly advocated for at the highest levels of the...

Katie Dill (00:48:01):
... Advocated for at the highest levels of the company. And with that, I think that fuels people's thinking as they're building their plans, but there is iteration in the plans and we do have multidisciplinary people making the plans together. So it's like, "Oh, okay, are we advancing these features? Are we going to be building growth? And is that improving the quality as well?" And so I think that's how we together get to it, but there's no formula that we ask people to.

Lenny (00:48:30):
So basically what I'm hearing is it's the cultural just people are hired with this expectation we are going to focus on quality and we'll prioritize things even though they may not move metrics because we know that this will generally improve and grow the business.

Katie Dill (00:48:43):
Part of it though is showing how it moves metrics, because I think that is a dangerous belief that is absolutely out there, as we talked about earlier, but that actual quality improvements do increase growth, they do improve the bottom line. For example, we saw that folks were reaching out to support because they didn't know the state of how one of their invoices was performing. And when we dig in, we realized it's, well, we had a button that looked nice, but it wasn't super clear, and so they didn't know how to access the thing that they were trying to do. And so by improving that, we decrease the need for them to have to reach out, which is clearly not their want to have to call somebody to find the answer to their problem. And so with that, we've made an improvement and we, of course, improve the bottom line because of that.

(00:49:38):
So I actually think that maybe one of the steps that somebody should consider in their organization is just you have those examples, every company does, where quality leads to better business outcomes and to talk about those and make them known, because I think it's actually a false belief that it's one or the other, it's like, "Are we going to work on quality and it doesn't move the metrics? And where we do." Some of them are longer term and so you have to look out for a while to see that change and the beliefs of your customers or how often they're sharing your product or how often they're succeeding in what they're trying to do, but some of them are short-term impacts and that is an important thing for people to be aware of because it will give them ideas of, oh, we could do this in our team too, we could have a higher quality product and actually move the business metrics.

Lenny (00:50:28):
Is there anything you do in how you evaluate performance of teams that helps prioritize this sort of thing? So generally it's just, cool, this team moved this metric by a ton, they're doing great. Is there anything that you bake into performance evaluations at Stripe, especially for product teams that help them understand and prioritize some of these things that may not obviously move metrics other than just broadly we believe great experiences are going to improve growth?

Katie Dill (00:50:54):
Well, I think one part is being clear on what impact means, because I do think that in some companies impact is just, okay, what business metric did I move and how much? And there are certainly really important impact projects that folks can have that maybe they're multi-quarter, multi-year, and so maybe you didn't move this incredibly important business metric in one quarter, but actually the work that you are doing is instrumental to the success of the business. So there's that. And then, like you said, there are perhaps quality efforts that are harder to measure or they're longer term, but they're still impactful. So I think number one is that when you're thinking about how to come up with the rubric for how you're going to judge performance, it's just really honing in on what does impact mean, and then a lot comes from that and being able to and celebrate and recognize great work happening even when it's not necessarily materially moving that number.

(00:51:59):
The other part of it is we have a ladder system. So it's a document that's not meant to lay out here's the checklist of all the things you need to do, but it's a guide for this is what is expected in your role and at this level, and in these documents we talk about the importance of things like quality in that what we pursue is building these things that are great. And another part of that is also the operating principles, which is the thing that we align on underneath all of these levels and ladders systems that we have. And our operating principles include meticulous craft. It is one of the things that is really important to us as an organization is just having that meticulous care for all that you do, whether it's you're designing the space that we work within or that you're creating the API or that you're building the interface or that you're talking to people on support calls, the meticulous craft is something that is actually expected of everybody.

Lenny (00:53:04):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products, customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product.

(00:53:53):
OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/leti.

(00:54:09):
I'm going to shift to a different topic and this is just the last area I want to spend some time on, which is team building leadership, that sort of thing. So you've led design at three hypergrowth companies, two of them, Airbnb and Stripe, are two of the biggest companies in the world, and also just known for great design. And I'm just going to ask a broad question, what have you learned about building, leading, managing, scaling large teams, are there lessons that stick with you? Anything come to mind when I ask that broad question?

Katie Dill (00:54:40):
One of the things that has stuck with me through all the trials and tribulations of leading, and as I've already laid out for you in the very beginning of this call, haven't always got it right, but one of the things that has been a clarifying force as I think about growing and leading teams, it's actually something I learned at Airbnb when we were there together, it's a formula sort of. So performance equals potential minus interference.

Lenny (00:55:10):
I love that.

Katie Dill (00:55:10):
And I really like this, it's pretty simple, but it's a good reminder that, as a leader, one of the things that you are of course driving towards is trying to get better performance so that your team feels more purpose and motivation and is excited about their work and that you're building greater things for your customers and you're having more business effect, and, of course, performance. But the key pieces of that, of course, is potential, so thinking about how you increase potential, which would be, of course, hiring really well, developing the talent and helping them grow and increase their own potential to do better and greater things. And then paired to that though of course is decreasing the interferences, which could be that lead weight on top of great talent, because you can hire the best people in the world, but like a muscle atrophying underneath a cast, if there are interferences that are holding them back from doing great work, they're going to burn out, they're not going to enjoy the work, they're not going to be as successful, and you will not get as strong of performance from it.

(00:56:14):
And so I really do think of this constantly as to how can I increase potential, how can I decrease interferences? And over time, especially as your company grows, you're going to have to keep doing that. The design work is never done in designing a team, because the more people you bring in, the more it puts your processes in a faulty state. I have intentionally run teams where you get to a point where it's like running hot, it's just like, "Okay, we've outgrown our processes." And that's okay because then you can learn as to, okay, this is how people are actually trying to work and this is how we actually can improve it. So making those changes as needed helps to make them more sought after and more informed in terms of as you improve the processes.

(00:57:05):
One of the things that I've been working on since I worked back at Airbnb was this idea of improving awareness of the things that are happening. What happens at a lot of companies, especially as they grow, is people lose touch with what's happening in different parts of the organization, and everybody's got a doc, their PRD, where they've written down what they've done and it's got tons of words that nobody really understands and keywords for the different projects, and that isn't the best way to lead to clarity. And I'm a strong believer that a picture tells a thousand words and a prototype saves a thousand meetings. What we do, and I've been doing it for the last decade or more, is having people within the design team share as a screenshot or a prototype of what they're working on in a shared deck.

(00:57:54):
And so they add this to a slide, in Google Slides decks every couple of weeks, and we get to see what's happening across the design team. And this is really important for all the designers because they could see, whether or not they're a team of 10 or 170 or whatever it might be, what is happening, and they can say, "Oh my gosh, you're working on that surface, so am I. And let's talk about it. Or Oh, that's an interesting pattern, maybe we could use this in more places." And we send it to the product managers and the engineer leaders and the leaders in the company because it is also a really great way for them to understand what's happening and what are we building together. Because going earlier, as I talked about, the importance of thinking about things as a journey, so what's happening in the marketing side, what's happening in this aspect of the product and seeing how all these pieces really fit together, that has been absolutely one of the things I will take wherever I go, whatever I do, because it has just been a very, very useful tool.

Lenny (00:58:51):
I remember that at Airbnb, and there's nothing more fun than just looking through a bunch of awesome designs and products that are in motion and in a deck form is so handy, just flip through what's going on around the company, I'm like, "Oh wow, look at this thing. That's amazing." And it's interesting that ends up in a deck, it feels like Figma would be really good for that too, but somehow decks are still really handy for simple things like that.

Katie Dill (00:59:11):
One of the key pieces is just keeping it really low maintenance. Yes, the design team would definitely prefer that it would be in Figma, but critically I want all functions to be able to look at it. And if not everybody is on Figma, if they were, that would be great too, but if they're not, it's just flipping through really easy, touch of a button, you can just send it off, it's behaviors that people are really used to and commenting. But maybe one day Figma.

Lenny (00:59:42):
And the way you do that is it's just like a scheduled call for all designers, add your stuff to this deck and then you email it out every two weeks I think you said?

Katie Dill (00:59:48):
Yeah, and we experiment with how often we ask folks to share and also the granularity of what they're doing. It is not meant to be a status check. We're not asking everyone, "Show us what you're doing." It's more of what are the projects that are happening? And we might ask, "Show us the medium and large projects," if there's such, it's too much going on and all of a sudden it's a 200-page deck and no one's going to flip through it. So we have experimented and evolved that depending on the team size, and I think right now we're at monthly sharing of it, and that seems to be working pretty well. It used to be biweekly, which I loved because I really love looking through, but if it's feels like it's a arduous task then it's not succeeding.

Lenny (01:00:31):
And especially knowing designers, they'd want to make sure it's the best version of what they've done, and it takes all this extra time to, okay, we got to make this beautiful mock to show [inaudible 01:00:39] working on.

Katie Dill (01:00:39):
And actually another part of it that is another benefit of opening up the curtain a little bit of certainly we have to take things seriously in terms of confidential work, it's work in progress, it's not ready to go live, we're not ready to critique all the details about this. We do need to make it very clear to folks that this is work in progress, but also that it is really beneficial to bring the work out because what isn't great is that you get to the end of the project and people have worked tirelessly on it for some long stretch of time and then find out that, oh my gosh, this is the same project that we're doing over here and this can be completely redundant, or these two things are on a path to collide.

(01:01:25):
So we want to know that sooner because it, absolutely, in the end of the day, will make the work better, save time. And so opening up that curtain and showing the work in progress, it can feel hard at first, but I think people have started to see the benefits in doing that and then usually that will lead to better outcomes in the long run in the culture too.

Lenny (01:01:46):
Going back to this formula you shared, which I love, performance equals potential minus interference, is there an example that comes to mind of helping with the interference where you found that, oh, wow, this is really slowing things down and you change something?

Katie Dill (01:01:59):
It actually goes back to org design that we talked about earlier and where people sit. So when I joined Lyft, as I mentioned to you earlier, I was like, oh, I had learned from the experience that I had at Airbnb and I came in needing to transform the organization, and was hopefully much better at it because I had learned so much. What actually was going on there is that the way that the team was organized before I got there was that actually physically the design team sat separately. They sat in a room that was just beautifully designed, separated from engineering and product and all the other functions by a locked door. And that was really interesting to see because of course there were a lot of benefits to it, which is that design had this very safe space for creative discovery and exploration and communication, there was work all over the walls, it was wall to wall whiteboards, and it was just absolutely a place where creativity could thrive.

Lenny (01:02:58):
It sounds exactly like the Airbnb situation, by the way.

Katie Dill (01:03:02):
The current Airbnb situation or the past?

Lenny (01:03:05):
The original, the [inaudible 01:03:05] times.

Katie Dill (01:03:07):
Yeah. And absolutely there are a lot of tie-ins to what I had seen. And the interesting part about how actually teams were working is that you would see that there was a lot of wasted work and there was a lot of misalignment in what we were trying to do because there was product managers and engineers that were sitting alongside each other making decisions and talking about the work and deciding things, and then designers were sitting over here in this other room and they were working on something, and then they'd meet up and it's like, "That's not aligned. No, that doesn't fit the goal. And you went that way, we were supposed to go over this way." And so interference in the sense that it was wasted work, it wasn't actually aligned to the goals, it was slower. And there were definitely benefits, there was real reasons for doing this, and I know there are companies including Apple that have separation of these things.

(01:03:58):
But I think if you're going into that way of working, there's probably a lot of other decisions you need to make too in terms of the way the teams work. And so what I was seeing there was just the composite of all these aspects coming together that was not leading to more efficient and less interference. And so what we did was to evolve the way we were working and bring better alignment to the different functions.

(01:04:22):
And, again, had done it with an approach about listening and came into that with a better understanding of getting to know the team and getting to know engineering and product and see what our goals were together so that when we were making changes we were making the changes together and we actually were aligned so that on the day that we opened the doors and brought design and product together and had spaces for folks to work together and they actually sat with each other, we still kept the creative space for this is where we'll do grits, this is where we'll do working sessions, this is where the folks that don't work in an embedded fashion we'll sit, but we had the best of both worlds in that way. And so with that alignment of the way that the teams were working together, there was much faster iteration cycles, better clarity on how the work was working, and we still kept and protected that room for creative space, literally the room in terms of figuratively speaking for allowing for creative exploration, but more aligned.

Lenny (01:05:23):
And just so I understand, essentially you reorged the teams and not just physically moved people, but you changed the way the product and design and eng team was even organized?

Katie Dill (01:05:35):
Yes, literally and figuratively we broke down the wall and brought the teams physically together so that they would work together, and then we had an org chart where it's like, okay, these designers are working on driver, these designers are working on rider, these designers are working on the safety team, and then they would sit with their respective engineers and product managers. And then as I talked about earlier, we would come together at key moments to make sure that we as a design function, we're still aligning on shared goals about the overall experience, but also making sure that we could work well with our partners.

Lenny (01:06:11):
So interesting that that was a recurring pattern at the places you went. I imagine Stripe was not like that, there was not all designers sitting in that locked room.

Katie Dill (01:06:18):
Not in a locked room. When I joined Stripe, it was a Zoom universe, so it's a little bit different, but even today we have a studio space where we have all the great tools of craft, and when you do go into the offices, we do have places where designers sit together, especially in the functions that aren't embedded. For example, we have brand and marketing creative, we have the website team, and we have folks that work across all of the things that we do. And so for sure there usually is some sort of creative space, which I actually think having a physical space for creative discovery and exploration and having that up on the wall, I love that so much. And I go into the office about halftime now, and I think over time we'll probably build that out more and more, because it is really powerful in addition to having teams sit by the disciplines that they work with every day.

Lenny (01:07:17):
It reminds me of a quote I have on my wall that I think I found in the Rick Rubin book, but it's by someone else, so I don't know exactly where I found it, but it's the object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable.

Katie Dill (01:07:32):
Ooh, that's good. I like that very much.

Lenny (01:07:34):
By Robert Henry. That's what I try to do in this little podcast studio that we got here.

Katie Dill (01:07:39):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:07:41):
Is there anything else that you think would be useful to share either from scaling design teams or broadly?

Katie Dill (01:07:50):
I think one of the other tendencies I see of companies in different stages of their growth is a fear of bold ideas. What happens is that... It can happen at small sizes and then it can happen at large sizes actually, it's just that a fear of shaking things up too much or big ideas with lots of things changing at once are really hard to measure. And so actually if we just make an incremental approach, it's very measured and we know what the outcome is going to be, it feels safer, I can get it done in the quarter, and depending on how your performance is managed, that might be more attractive. And so that is a dangerous tendency, because I think if we go back to what quality means, and you think about it as, well, quality is really your users are the judge of that, and the way that they experience things oftentimes across products, across surface, across time, if you just think about these incremental approaches to the scope of whatever that is that you own, you are very likely not to make the whole thing better.

(01:08:57):
So I think we have to fight against that. And the way I look at it is, the way I talk about it is reach for the stars and land on the moon. And what I mean by that is that vision work is really important, and I think sometimes you can get a bad name because you can end up with some folks that are doing vision work that goes nowhere, and they make a beautiful deck and then it gets seated on a shelf and nobody ever builds it. That is not what I'm talking about here, that is not what I recommend, but actually vision work that absolutely does look at the entirety of the experience, a comprehensive approach, a journey approach, and thinks about how these various things may come together to be better, and sketch out the ideal version. And I think Brian Chesky talks about it, I think it was the 11-star experience I think he once said.

Lenny (01:09:45):
[inaudible 01:09:45] stuff. That's what we talked about a couple of times in this podcast.

Katie Dill (01:09:47):
Exactly. Looking at it as a journey. It's not the five-star approach, it's not the six-star approach, but the 11-star approach, but show what that ideal version is, because if you don't know what that is, what are the chances that you're going to increment yourself to the right outcome in the end? And as I talked about before, building the house, you want to see what that picture looks like and how all these pieces come together, and I strongly recommend you want to see what it looks like in an ideal form, because you can always work back from that.

(01:10:17):
And so it's like, "Okay, if this is what we want to get to, this is what our product is going to look like in two years, how do we get there?" And what very likely is it's a team effort and various parts of your organization are going to have to own various parts, and maybe we ship this piece first so that we can study it and learn and make sure that the data is good before we move to the next piece, I'm not suggesting you have to ship the whole thing at once, but that North Star lays out the process in a way that I think allows for big risk taking in a way that is measured and thoughtful and actually also feels like progress as you step towards that versus trying to get their day one and likely end up giving up.

Lenny (01:11:02):
I love that, reach for the stars, land on the moon. That could be a metaphor for so many things. Let me try to squeeze in one more tactical tip for people listening. If someone's hiring a designer, so someone that's not a designer, just a founder of product team, what should you look for that may be a red flag or something that you want to look for to feel good that they're going to be a good fit?

Katie Dill (01:11:23):
The key, I think, to keep in mind is it's easier to teach tools and process than it is taste and character, so I would certainly pay a lot of attention to that. Their hit rate for great judgment and great taste, and how they've honed that, even if they're not very experienced, just to see do they have that natural inclination for great things. The other piece of it is that certainly you want to find somebody with great talent, for sure, and high craft, but you...

Katie Dill (01:12:00):
Talent, for sure, and high craft, but you also want to find somebody that's humble. Folks that are really good at what they do aren't always, but humility is a really important part. I think it's a really important part for anybody on a team because if you're working on a team, you need to work together. And it is important that they have that respect and empathy and understanding and enthusiasm for the folks around them, but also the users. Humility means that they're going to pay more attention to what the users are saying and hopefully be curious about what's working and what's not, and strive to navigate these things to make it better. The last piece would just be hustle or chutzpah. I'm not sure exactly what's the right way to put it, but the design and the creative functions is the act of creation.

(01:12:53):
And it's scary. To take a blank piece of paper and propose something that you think is better, is scary. To have the courage to say, "This is not good enough and we should do it again," is scary. Having somebody that has that courage inside them to fight for great is pretty important. And that hustle to try to execute on that rapidly is, of course, essential as you're hiring at any stage company.

(01:13:23):
Lastly, I think you were asking in particular, especially with younger companies or with startups, I think one thing that can be hard, it's like do you hire a more junior doer or a more senior thinker/operator? It's like if you had all the money in the world, all of it. But I do think in your early stages you probably do need a doer, but it is important to also have that lens of how do you build an organization that's user-focused and the way that they operate and the way that they work together, and bringing a strategy that will help to be user-focused from the start. Maybe a great way of doing that is having a more senior leader, design advisor, and then a kind of executor or doer full-time on the team.

Lenny (01:14:10):
That's a really cool tip. On the craft and taste piece, a lot of times people don't have that themselves necessarily. Any tip for how to measure that? Is there a book you'd recommend or trick? Or is it just trust your judgment and does this feel great to you?

Katie Dill (01:14:28):
It's contingent on what is the thing, what is the user need? Something that is really great, we do a lot of tools that we strive to make them power tools for our users. And a lot of times that means dense information that is still easily accessible, but will definitely feel different than perhaps a consumer product that is meant to be extremely light and sparse and directive to one individual thing at a time. So it really depends on the context of the product sometimes. That's why it's hard to kind of quote an individual book. But yeah, I can think on it and we can put it in the show notes. There are definitely books that talk about the principles of great design and we can look at that.

Lenny (01:15:12):
Amazing. We'll link to extra books that come to mind after. One other question I wanted to ask is, what's a favorite project that y'all have worked on at Stripe?

Katie Dill (01:15:21):
Oh yeah, we got a good one that I'm so excited about. First off, I don't know if everybody knows this, but Stripe prints books. Stripe Press, we print books that are, we consider, ideas of progress. It's our intention of bringing great ideas out there. Most of them don't have anything to do with financial infrastructure. It might be any number of interesting problems and opportunities of things and ideas that people have talked about.

Lenny (01:15:50):
I have many of them in my background here. I'm a huge fan of Stripe Press.

Katie Dill (01:15:55):
Nice. And we take great care to deliver these ideas of progress and books that hopefully feel beautiful. We have a new book coming up that you can pre-order now, and it is Poor Charlie's Almanac. It's actually-

Lenny (01:15:55):
Already pre-ordered.

Katie Dill (01:15:55):
You did? I actually excited to hear that.

Lenny (01:15:55):
I'm really excited for it.

Katie Dill (01:16:12):
It's a fascinating book. It's 20 years old. It's actually Charlie Munger's words, but Peter Kaufman, a friend and a colleague of his, assembled all of these documents over the years of things that Charlie had written and said and put it into this kind of anthology. And so this book is really fascinating and it's not really a linear story so much. We have reprinted this book. We created a teaser site that I strongly recommend you all check out. It's really, really fun.

Lenny (01:16:41):
Oh, man, it's unreal. I remember when you launched that. I was like, "It just keeps going and gets crazier and wilder and amazing." I don't even know how that's possible on a website.

Katie Dill (01:16:49):
It's pretty awesome. Our website team is... We talked about the importance of design and engineering working super closely together. It's just like that. That art and science coming together into something that hopefully is fun and engaging and people want to pursue it. So the book will be coming out soon and we're working on an update to the site that we're really, really thrilled about, so you can read the book online in a special way. So yeah, very big fan of this.

Lenny (01:17:17):
What's the website for folks? Do you happen to have the URL? Otherwise, we'll link to it in the show notes for

Katie Dill (01:17:21):
The book. Yeah, yeah. It is press.stripe.com will be where you can see all the books that we have at Stripe Press. And I believe the first one in the line... And actually what you'll see in the website is that we originally had a typical buying model of the squares outlined. One of the things that we sought to do with the website is to consider what would be a great experience for understanding different books. And when you go into a bookstore and you see the spines of the books and you pick them up and you turn them around and you look at them. And so that's actually what you will... I should stop describing it. Just go and check it out and you'll see we sought to deliver this work in a way that would be aligned with what a reader would want to pursue.

Lenny (01:18:07):
I can't help but ask, but how did that even come together? Was it just like this passion project of like, "This book's coming out, I just want to invest a bunch of time resources into this?" Or how does that happen at Stripe?

Katie Dill (01:18:19):
Stripe's mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. We strive to build global economic prosperity because that's greater access across the globe. But there's more ways to do that than financial infrastructure. Financial infrastructure is absolutely a major part of that. It is like the lifeblood of businesses, and it enables them to accomplish more. But this notion of ideas of progress is another angle into that. While it might not be our core business, it is very much aligned with our mission. And so yes, it takes time, but we feel that it's important for what we're setting out to do. And it also relates to the pursuit of creativity and excellence. It is a part of our identity. It is a part of who we feel we are or we strive to be, and we're excited to share that with people. It's in some ways how they get to know us and they get to see the care that we put into any number of things.

Lenny (01:19:19):
Katie, is there anything else you want to share or touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Katie Dill (01:19:24):
We talked a little bit about the importance of different disciplines and the importance of quality being a group effort. I hope this doesn't insult my function, as I say, but at the core, design is simply intention. You're bringing intentionality to the decisions that you make in thinking about who is this thing for. If you're designing a doorknob, let's say, and it's like, "Does the doorknob speak to whether or not I'm going to push or pull or turn? Is it comfortable in the hand? Is it easy to manufacture? Is it easy to put on and remove?" These are some of the intentional decisions one could make, whether or not they're a designer, an engineer, the product person, any old function can put that intentionality.

(01:20:17):
If you think about who is impacted by this, who is using this? And that literally could be anything from designing a doorknob to designing your org structure to designing your strategy. Obviously, great design is also creative, and it also is demonstrated with great taste for what is beauty. Of course, that's where I would say that design expertise with people that have these creative skills and this great taste is an incredible important thing to bring into the organization. Day one, everybody can bring more care and intentionality, and I think that will result in better outcomes, internally and externally, in the long run.

(01:20:56):
I think your podcast is a great example of great craft and great quality. I was just saying this to my husband the other day, as I was talking about doing this. It's just like, your podcasts... There's more usable learning per minute than most. I don't know if that's a metric that you're measuring, but I love how you don't have your guests tell about their background. Because when someone tells about their background, that is interesting, but it's not really usable information. It's like, "I can take this information and run with it and then bring it to my own team and make my work better." You have clearly thought about that. Well, I don't know if that's why you made that decision.

Lenny (01:21:38):
Absolutely. That is exactly [inaudible 01:21:40]

Katie Dill (01:21:41):
Okay, great. I also love the way that you set these things up. You had said to me, in the thing that you set me, it's just like, "If it's not good, we're not going to ship it." And you set it in very nice ways, by the way. But at first I had this like, "Oh gosh, what if it's not good?" But I also had this moment of like, "Well, that's pretty great because if it's not good, he's not going to embarrass me to the rest of the world, hopefully." And I love that because that was that courage that I was talking about earlier, too, of that you're not going to let bad go out, because you know that each one of these little things will end up leading to a belief of the level of quality of what somebody can rely on getting when they listen to your podcast. Again, one workout isn't going to be a six-pack, but every one of those things will end up leading to better quality overall. I don't know, kudos to you. You're nailing it. So great.

Lenny (01:22:36):
Katie, what a nice way to end it. I really appreciate that. That's exactly how I think about it, actually. You cracked my whole strategy of just making it as concretely useful as possible. I was actually on David Perell's podcast recently and he had this really good way of describing this, which is exactly what I've tried to do, but I haven't put my words into it of make it as useful as possible per minute without removing the humanity. And I realized that's what I do, is I could cut all the stories of everyone's backgrounds, but that sucks. It's optimize for value and concrete, tactical advice, but also make it fun and human and interesting.

(01:23:15):
So thank you for the kind words. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a number of questions for you. Are you ready?

Katie Dill (01:23:24):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:23:25):
Okay, let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Katie Dill (01:23:30):
One, How to Win Friends and Influence People. It's an oldie but a goodie. I forget how many years old it is, but many, many decades. I think it was in the 1930s? The cover is funny. You might be embarrassed to read it on a bus, I don't know. But the learnings from it are timeless, and I've actually read it four times and I can always do for another because it is a great reminder of just how important the way you articulate things are. And not in a negative or gross kind of way, but people care first and foremost about themselves. That's the body that they're within, that is the context that they're within. Recognizing that can be really powerful as you think about leading teams, as you think about working with other people, as you think about being a good spouse, whatever it might be. I'm a big fan of that one.

(01:24:19):
The other one is a newer book, I think actually still a couple of years old. It's about the Wright Brothers by David McCullough, I think. I've been learning how to fly, and so I'm very obsessed with this, but I think it's a book that's relevant to everybody. Especially even entrepreneurs, because it just talks about the impossible challenge of nobody thought it could be done. Even the American Institute of Science didn't think it could be done. And these individuals that had the resolve and the commitment to make it happen. I think also the power of this beautiful partnership. Of course, they're brothers. That doesn't always mean you get along, but they're brothers and they did, and it's a beautiful story. Big, big, big fan of that.

(01:25:05):
And then third book, I would just say is... Actually, I brought it over because I knew you were going to ask me this question. I don't know if you could read that, but The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse. This book was given to me by Jenny Yarden, which I think you may know. It's wonderful. It's a beautiful story. It makes you laugh, it teaches you a thing or two, and one of the best quotes in it is, "One of our greatest freedoms is how we react to things."

Lenny (01:25:32):
Very Buddhist.

Katie Dill (01:25:33):
Yes.

Lenny (01:25:35):
What is a recent favorite movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Katie Dill (01:25:39):
Oppenheimer was amazing. And TV show? Shrinking. And that one was really good, and it actually really surprised me how funny and positive it was, because the trailer for it does not give that impression. But it was really good.

Lenny (01:25:55):
I've not seen that. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Katie Dill (01:26:01):
Tell me what work you are most proud of. And the reason I ask that is because it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.

Lenny (01:26:28):
Is there a favorite product you recently discovered, be it an app or physical thing? Anything?

Katie Dill (01:26:32):
Yeah. As a parent, you should definitely know the Toniebox.

Lenny (01:26:37):
Ooh, I don't don't know this. The Toniebox?

Katie Dill (01:26:40):
It's so good. The Toniebox. I should have brought it over, too. So it's like a squishy box, but it's a speaker. And your kids can control it. And the way they control it is these little figurines. This is also a brilliant product because you want to buy all these figurines. But the little figurines, it could be like Belle from Beauty and the Beast or Elsa from Frozen, and they place the figurine on top and that activates the stories that the thing reads to you or the songs that it plays for you. You can record your own voice so that you're telling stories to your child. And they control it all by themselves and they can drop it on the floor and it's all good. But the Toniebox, pretty awesome.

Lenny (01:27:20):
I just texted my wife to check this out so I don't forget. Amazing. Great. Very handy and timely. Do you have a favorite life motto that you'd like to share, come back to, find meaningful?

Katie Dill (01:27:31):
I don't say this out loud, but I've had it as a Post-It in my jewelry box and that I see regularly. Tomorrow is today. And what I mean by that is that so often I will in my head be like, "I'll do that tomorrow. I'll eat better tomorrow. I'll think about that vision tomorrow. I'll communicate better expectations tomorrow." And it's like those joke signs that "Free beer tomorrow." Because very easily, tomorrow just always moves on. And I needed to remind myself that it's actually, it is now today. Tomorrow is now today.

Lenny (01:28:14):
I love that one. I feel like I need to take all these mottoes, which are amazing. I love this question that I just invented. And just put them all on my wall here in this office.

Katie Dill (01:28:22):
Yes, that's a great idea. You should make a book. Book of Lenny Mottoes.

Lenny (01:28:26):
Oh, man. The Tribe of Mentors version of Lenny's podcast.

Katie Dill (01:28:29):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:28:30):
Is there a lesson that your mom or dad taught you that has really stuck with you, especially as a newish parent?

Katie Dill (01:28:39):
I think about this a lot. I am a mom of twin girls, and I feel so lucky that my parents raised me to see that accomplishment is based on merit and hard work. They never made me feel like because I was small and that I was not as strong as somebody, whatever it might be, that I wasn't able. My dad had me chopping wood and mixing cement as a young kid, and that certainly led me in one part to be a designer, but also to be able to pursue leadership. Even though sometimes I'm comfortable willing to be in the room where I am vastly outnumbered by people that don't look like me or just not letting that hold me back.

(01:29:31):
And actually, I thought about that the other day because I was riding in a Lyft to the airport. This was also at 4:00 AM, so it was a really hard time to be in a Lyft to gone to the airport. The driver was telling me about his kids, and actually he had twins. It was one boy and one girl, and so we were talking about twins. He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, my girl, she's my princess. My son doesn't understand why I don't let her take out the garbage and why her job is to sweep and that's his job." He's like, "I'm not going to let her take out the garbage." I was sitting in the back of the car wondering, "Should I tell him, you're screwing it up?"

(01:30:07):
Just because she's a female doesn't mean that she's not able to do the jobs, even the hard ones and even the bad ones taking off the trash. I really do think that I'm so fortunate that that was never the way that my parents were looking at it. Now, today, I feel like that is very much a part of a little bit of my chutzpah and willingness to step out there because I hadn't been held back from those hard jobs earlier.

Lenny (01:30:39):
Final question. You mentioned that you fly planes, and this is actually related to my last question. I guess one that I was going to ask if that's true, you mentioned it is true. Is there a lesson that you've taken from learning to fly and flying that you've brought into product, leadership, design? Anything come to mind?

Katie Dill (01:30:57):
First of all, learning to fly has been such an amazing experience because there haven't been many things in my adult life where you feel like yourself going from knowing nothing about something and being able to do something, and what an incredible journey that is. Whether it's learning a language or whatever, that is awesome and highly recommended. But one of the key things that has definitely sat with me from the experience of learning how to fly that I definitely thought about how to bring it into my work is that when I was getting to the stage of being able to do things myself... My instructor is sitting there next to me and usually is right there at the controls with me, so if something goes wrong when I'm flying, he's right there.

(01:31:46):
I remember one of the first times when I was learning how to land where he moved his seat back. A lot. And so he was now out of touch with the controls. He could jump there if he needed to, but he really pulled back. And it was such an incredible visceral experience. I was like, "He trusts me. Right now, he is showing his faith in me to take this and take this challenge on." And I think about that all the time. It's just like, "How can I show my team, people I work with, my support and trust in them to take that challenge on?" I can't always move my seat back, but what might be the way? And so that's been a pretty great example of something I want to pull forward.

Lenny (01:32:35):
That is an awesome metaphor. I feel like this whole episode is just full of beautiful metaphors. Also, just full of beauty. Katie, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find online if they want to reach out and maybe ask some questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Katie Dill (01:32:50):
First off, please do find me online because, as I talked about, we are in the pursuit of trying to build excellent things and it's always a work in progress, and so I'm always interested to learn how others do it and see how we can improve our own methods. I am Lil_Dill on Twitter, and then I think that name was taken on Threads, so I'm Lil_Dilly, with a Y, on Threads, and then I'm on LinkedIn and find me there. We're hiring, so definitely reach out at our job board, too. Stripe.com/jobs. Definitely check us out. We definitely would love to hear from you.

Lenny (01:33:30):
Katie. Again, thank you so much for being here.

Katie Dill (01:33:33):
Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny (01:33:34):

# Twitter’s ex-Head of Product on Elon, consumer products, culture, more | Kayvon Beykpour

## Transcript

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:00):
The first time I ever met Elon was over FaceTime. He was just like, "Do you want to just come hang out? You can swipe left or swipe right."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):
You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:15):
We wanted to change the lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product had changed at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
Here's a list of stuff that your team shipped while you were there, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, Fleets, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, Twitter Blue, Spaces, and obviously, live video.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:31):
The sacred cows are like their own roadmap. What are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
This was all relatively quickly.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:39):
I was like, "I might flame out completely, but Hell if I don't try."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):
Today, my guest is Kayvon Beykpour. Kayvon was the beloved and longest-tenured head of product at Twitter and also GM of the consumer business at Twitter up until the day that it was sold to Elon Musk. He landed at Twitter through an acquisition of his company, Periscope, which was the world's largest live-streaming platform, which ended up inspiring Instagram Live, TikTok Live, Facebook Live, and basically every other social network getting into live video. He sold the company to Twitter in 2015, continued leading Periscope for a number of years, and then moved into leading product and then the entire consumer business.

(00:01:19):
In our wide-ranging conversation, Kayvon shares what it was like getting Elon up to speed at Twitter, what it was like to be fired from Twitter, which actually happened during his pat leave. He also shares all kinds of lessons and stories from transforming Twitter's internal culture from a risk-averse, stagnant, product org to one that was shipping major features regularly. We talk about how they used acquihires and up-and-coming hungry product leaders to lead new initiatives and break through many of their sacred cows.

(00:01:47):
We also get into jobs-to-be-done, Elon's layoffs of most of Twitter's staff after the acquisition, his lessons from building and shutting down Periscope, and also building consumer products in general, and so much more. This episode is full of stories and lessons and a bunch of stuff that you haven't heard anywhere else. With that, I bring you Kayvon Beykpour after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:03:23):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never-ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug.

(00:03:45):
Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.

(00:04:28):
Kayvon, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:04:35):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. Great to meet you finally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):
It's amazing to meet you. I think this is going to be quite a unique and interesting podcast. A big thank you to Scott Belsky, illustrious former podcast guest for introducing us. When he introduced us, the one thing that he told me is that "Hopefully, Kayvon will share the story about our time getting Elon up to speed at Twitter." I would love to hear that story. I bet other people would too. Are you able to share that story?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:05:03):
When all the drama went down with Twitter and Elon ended up buying the company and after the eight months saga of legal back and forth ended up actually taking control of the company, there was that first two-day period where it was complete chaos at Twitter with the sink and Elon spreading his tentacles trying to find out who are the people that he wants to keep and what are the projects that are interesting. In the midst of all that, Scott ended up getting contacted and being asked, "Who should Elon talk to?" Scott recommended that Elon chat with me.

(00:05:42):
So, the first time I ever met Elon was over at FaceTime where Elon was just very curious to ask, "Hey, you were at Twitter for a while. You seem to have done some things. What should I be digging into, and who I be talking to?" At the end of that conversation, we ended up arranging an in-person meeting where Scott and I went to Twitter HQ to actually meet Elon. I think this was day two of Elon having brought the sink in. So, we had this really bizarre, wild, but really fun experience of walking into Twitter HQ, and in my case, walking back to Twitter HQ for the first time after having been fired, which was a very strange experience for me, and we walked into the building.

(00:06:29):
I was scurried through the back door because I didn't want to make a scene and make it ... There was a lot of rumors around is Kayvon coming back, and I just wanted to avoid all of that. So, it was just a very weird experience of being scurried through the elevator and through the back door and go to this massive conference room, which we had on the second floor of the 110th building.

(00:06:53):
In that massive conference room, it was me, Scott, Elon, and then at the very, very end of the room, Walter Isaacson, who by the way, I had a hard time. I knew I recognized. I'd never met Walter in person, but I was like, "Is that Walter Isaacson?" But he said nothing the entire time, and we had probably a two-hour conversation talking about the past, the future of Twitter, the good, the bad, the ugly. At the very end of the conversation, Walter came up and introduced himself and was like, "Hi, I'm Walter. Can I get your information just in case I need to ask any follow-up questions?" And I was like, "Oh, shit. I guess that whole conversation was on the record. I don't know."

(00:07:31):
So, it was a very surreal experience for a bunch of reasons, including just being weird for me since I was very conflicted about coming back to Twitter, even physically in the office. But I must say it was really fun. It was fun talking to someone. Obviously Elon, I'd never met him before, and he's one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time. So, that was exciting to go into that meeting. Also, I had been spending so much time dreaming about Twitter and trying to mold Twitter in a direction that I thought was compelling and working with a team of people to do that, and to meet someone who also had a similar ambition, but obviously, in different ways ... He had his own dream for Twitter ... but it was really bizarre and unique and surreal seeing that glimmer in someone else who was like, "Yeah, I also just bought this thing, so I can actually do whatever the Hell I want. And by the way, here's some crazy dreams I have for doing it."

(00:08:35):
It was just a really ... As someone who had had their own dreams for the product, witnessing that it was really unusual and cool. I think that's probably what Scott meant when he said, "You should ask Kayvon about that," was that I think we both kind of recognized that something's about to happen here. Obviously, you have this very public spectacle of someone essentially having a takeover of a public company, but all of that stuff aside, also, you could tell Elon was scheming and cooking up, "What am I going to do with this?" It was cool to see that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):
That's an amazing story. I love the Walter Isaacson component of it. Do you feel like you made a dent on his approach and way of thinking? Obviously, he made a lot of big radical changes. Do you feel like you made a dent in his view of where Twitter should go?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:09:26):
I don't know. I certainly don't think I've made any impression on how he should run the company. I think that's Elon's going to Elon in his way, and I think he certainly has had some radical moves in terms of how he's running the company, the decisions he made, how many people he let go, how the company is structured, the culture, and all that stuff is like ... We didn't even talk about that stuff.

(00:09:49):
I think what we spent time talking about is I shared my perspective with him of people I thought who were exceptional, who were at the company, and if I was in his shoes, who I would spend time with and embrace. Most of the people that I mentioned are still there, which is awesome, and they seem to be A, empowered, which is great, and B, having fun, which is awesome. So, hopefully, that stuff is useful.

(00:10:16):
We spent a bunch of time brainstorming products, and I had my set of projects that I was very passionate about because we'd given birth to them. I think a bunch of those projects, it seems like Twitter's still investing in and putting a lot of energy behind like Community Notes, which at the time was called Birdwatch. But I always felt really bullish on that being the future of essentially how content is moderated on Twitter, just because it was very clear that the way we were handling content moderation among many other flaws just wasn't scalable.

(00:10:55):
Spaces and Communities and the Creator Program of helping people make money on the platform, those are projects that we started over the year-ish prior to Elon taking over. My hope, having left the company and having had a new leader come in, was that those things would be given more oxygen. It's been awesome to see that those have been continuing to grow and be molded in different directions. Yeah, I think in that sense, I hope that our brainstorm was useful, but for all I know he doesn't even remember the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):
I freaking love Community Notes. It's such an amazing product. Let me ask two more dramatic-oriented Elon Twitter questions just to get these out of the way. The first is you said you were fired. I don't know if you've shared that publicly. People always wondered, I think, what happened. I know you tweeted during your pat leave, "I'm leaving Twitter," and no one really knows the story as far as I know. What actually went on there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:11:53):
It was weird, to say the least. Honestly, it took me some time to come to peace with it because it was frustrating and surprising. I guess the story of what happened starts with Jack resigning. Jack resigned in ... It was like November of 2021 at the end of the year. The board chose Parag to be the CEO of the company, and I've had a long relationship with Parag. I respect him, but I had mixed feelings about that.

(00:12:23):
To his credit, Parag very quickly addressed one of the biggest things that I was really frustrated about in the last three years essentially of my time at Twitter. One of my biggest points of feedback and points of consternation was the structure of the company in that we had a functional organizational model, meaning we had a head of consumer product, me, we had a head of revenue product, Bruce, we had a head of engineering, we had a head of design, we had head research. It was a functionally run organization.

(00:12:52):
And the combination of that model and the type of leader that Jack was wasn't working in my view. I think if you're going to have a functional organization, you need to have a GM or a CEO who's extremely leaned-in to tiebreak and resolve conflict and make sure the team is moving quickly. And Jack, for all of his amazing qualities, just wasn't operating that way, and so you had a group of highly opinionated people that often disagreed and would create either the need for consensus or deadlock. That just was driving a lot of people crazy, including me, and I think it really held us back from living up to Twitter's potential.

(00:13:29):
Anyway, all of that was super frustrating for me, and the combination of that and a dramatic change in leadership with Jack leaving and Parag coming in, I wasn't feeling too stoked. Parag to his credit, when he became CEO, quickly changed that and shifted the company to be a GM structure. And he promoted me to being the GM of consumers. So, for the prior three-ish years, having been responsible for growing Twitter's consumer product, I was only responsible for the product management team. I didn't have engineering or design, and that honestly was difficult. It's very difficult to change culture with one hand tied behind your back.

(00:14:10):
Still no regrets. Had a lot of fun. I think we had some impact, but it was frustrating. So, Parag changed that. The irony of this, by the way, is he was one of the biggest proponents of the functional structure. When he became a CEO, he changed the structure, promoted me to be the GM of consumer, and I was, at that point, one month ... This is one month before I went on pat leave because my daughter was due.

(00:14:35):
So, I went into my paternity leave being like, "All right, I'm going to give this a shot. We'll see. We'll see how this goes," as Parag addressed the biggest frustration that I had with the company and how it was being run. So, I had some trepidations but went into my pat leave feeling optimistic. Mind you, this was all before Elon was even part of the picture. He had not become a board member. There was no news about him having beef with the executive team or for that matter, trying to buy the company.

(00:15:06):
So, I went on pat leave maybe a week and a half before our daughter's due date. Three weeks goes by. In that three weeks, Elon joins the board, leaves the board, makes an offer, has a short dramatic feud about whether that goes through. And also during that time, my daughter was born. Some drama at the hospital for us, but a week afterwards, we come home. Mom's healthy. Daughter's healthy.

(00:15:35):
The day after we get home from the hospital, Parag called me and said that he was letting me go and that he was taking the team in a different direction. That night, Twitter signed a term sheet with Elon to sell the company. So, a lot happened in a very short period of time, and the reason that Parag gave is exactly what I shared publicly, which was that he wanted to take the team in a different direction. The only other thing he said is that given that new direction, he thinks that the things that I'm good at, Twitter doesn't need anymore. And the things that Twitter needs are not particularly in my skill set or in my interest.

(00:16:14):
He wasn't particularly expressive about what that direction was, but that was the reason he gave me. That was a huge bummer for me for a bunch of reasons. One, I love the company. I love the product, and also it just sucks to leave not on your own terms. And two, I was just confused. The timing was very frustrating and confusing for me, not least of which because I had just come home from the hospital while on paternity leave. But also because at that time, especially the fact that Elon was buying the company was ...

(00:16:48):
Well, I was conflicted, honestly. I was very excited because Elon is someone that I looked up to immensely, and you just look at the things that he's achieved in the world and you can't help but be inspired by that. And two, Twitter for all of, I think, the impact and progress that we had made, had a lot of challenges associated with its governance and the fact that it was constantly vulnerable as a public company. So, there's just always this drama associated with Twitter as a public company, even a private company before that, that made it extremely hard as a builder to get shit done and have the product live up to its potential.

(00:17:27):
One of the benefits of this particular takeover was that Elon offered a path towards solving all of that. It was like, "Oh, cool, now you've got one owner who happens to be, by the way, extremely opinionated about the product and a voracious consumer and creator of the product." I think there was an incredible opportunity in that that now you have this organization and this product and this incredible ecosystem that can be devoid of all the political bullshit associated with being a public company. Now, it has this conduit to just living up to its potential.

(00:17:59):
So, it was a bummer to be removed from that, I suppose, without having any agency myself. That was very a long-winded answer to your question, but that's what happened towards the end there. Like I said at the beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with it and to be at peace with it. I did eventually. Listen, there's a huge silver lining of I spent the first year of my daughter's life with her and my family. My wife Sarah had left Twitter eight months prior to me leaving, and so when's the next time we could all be together and have time and space to just enjoy each other and our new family, and frankly, to avoid a lot of the drama that ended up ensuing that not a lot of people could have predicted? The deal was on. The deal was off. It is just a whole lot of drama that I got to miss, which is the silver lining.

(00:18:53):
Then it was confusing there for a bit because when Elon did end up buying the company, in that conversation that I had with him, it was definitely ... I was conflicted about do I want to maybe spend some time working on this still? Elon was very cool about ... He actually used this phrase at the end of our conversation, which I still find hilarious. He was just like, "Do you want to just come? You seem like you care about the product, and you don't have dumb ideas. Do you want to come hang out?" And I was like, "What would my job be?" And he was like, "Don't know, just hang out, and you can swipe left or swipe right." He used the swipe right, swipe left Tinder metaphor, and I thought that was hilarious coming from him.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):
For ideas that come up just like, "Here, I have this idea [inaudible 00:19:41]?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:19:40):
No, like swipe right on whether you want to be here or swipe ... He's like, "We don't have to make this a thing. Just do you want to hang out and work on the product with us?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:40):
That's so funny.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:19:51):
So, I ended up deciding that actually, I'm just ready. I'm ready to move on. I spent enough time at this company, at this product trying to shape it into something that I was passionate about. I think it's someone else's turn, and especially Elon. If you buy it's your turn. You can do whatever you want with it.

(00:20:13):
So, that was conflicting for a bit, but I would say towards the end of the year, it was pretty clear in my mind that I was ready to move on and start thinking about other problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):
What I think about is there's always this tension being a PM at a company with a very strong-minded, product-oriented founder, and I feel like you would've been in the epitome worst possible situation there, where you're a product leader between Elon and the rest of org. So, I think it probably would not have worked out.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:20:40):
I'm not sure I would've been able to articulate it as succinctly as you did just now, but I think that is the feeling that I had that it's not my place anymore. I don't have a canvas to try and exert my dreams on this place. I think Elon took that mantle, and I'm excited to see what he going to do with it is the feeling I had.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):
Yeah. You've touched on this. You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time, all kinds of stuff. So, here's a list of stuff that I've gathered your team shipped while you were there. Twitter Blue, which is I think called Premium now, Spaces, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, fleets, being able to see Instagram photos in line, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, tons of UX improvements, and obviously, live video. What did you learn about how to change a product culture from a company that's very risk-averse and essentially just not shipping a lot to taking big, bold bets and becoming a lot more open to new stuff?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:21:53):
Trying to drive culture change is both one of the most challenging things and rewarding things. For the first year of my role ... There was a chapter of my time at Twitter, maybe just to backup, that was just leading Periscope. In that first chapter of maybe two years, I was not really involved with Twitter stuff all that much. That started to change when we really tried integrating Periscope with Twitter, but chapter two of my time at Twitter was when I became the head of product. That first year of being the head of product was one of the most difficult of my career not because the work was difficult, but because it was so politically and bureaucratically exhausting to try and change culture in a way that just there wasn't alignment around.

(00:22:40):
It comes back to the point I was making earlier around the organization of the company was functional, and so it is one thing for me to have some ideas and a plan and a strategy that I felt compelling. But when you have to essentially drive consensus amongst your peers across the other functions, that's a different game. That's not execution. That's politics and consensus building. I both can't stand that stuff, but I think ... This is going to sound like I'm tooting my own horn, but good enough at it and I have enough patience at it that I invested the time and the energy. I think a less patient person wouldn't have bothered and would've thrown their hands up.

(00:23:25):
I think honestly, a lot of it just comes down to I had practice. At my first company that I started in college with one of my best friends, Joe, who I ended up co-founding Periscope with, we got acquired by a big, public, ad tech company called Blackboard, and we were 19 at the time. We got thrown into a public ... I was a senior executive at a public company that was not your quintessential tech company. It was even more difficult to get things done. So, through the four years I spent there, I learned a lot about how to navigate that type of environment.

(00:23:56):
It all came coming back when I was given the product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like-

Kayvon Beykpour (00:24:00):
... product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like walking through mud, and it was really difficult. But I think when we started building that alignment and building excitement that like, oh, actually maybe we should be taking some bigger swings, and when we started seeing through the execution against some of those plans, I think it ended up, it got easier and easier. It becomes addicting. I think people end up feeling like, oh wow, maybe these sacred cows we had didn't need to be so sacred.

(00:24:37):
And so I think after that first year, it became a lot more fun. It was still difficult, but it felt like we were all swimming in the same direction a lot more. But I think my takeaway there is you can't change culture without having alignment from the top. It's difficult to change culture when you have a pocket of a company trying to advocate for change.

(00:25:01):
So I think we got there in the end. We didn't move as much urgency as I think we drove. We were not fast enough, we were not bold enough. I was consistently dissatisfied with what I was achieving and what our team was achieving. But I think we did make a change. Twitter was an organization that had a lot of sacred cows and became very [inaudible 00:25:24] in its ways. Literally the first two years I was at the company, the stated product strategy for Twitter was refine the core. It was like, we're not making any big bets here, team. Our goal is to keep turning the knobs that are working.

(00:25:42):
And listen, as much as I was kind of throwing stones from the sidelines through that period when I was in Periscope land in our separate office a few blocks away from the mothership, that focus actually did help the company for some period. The reason why Twitter went from stagnant to declining DAU growth to growing DAU again is because they refined the core. This is when they went from the reverse chronological timeline to the ranked timeline, and the year after that was a lot of knob turning. It was like, how do we make these recommendations better? How do we make our push notifications more relevant?

(00:26:16):
Now, that is not an inspiring product strategy. That does not result in the product feeling materially different or adding new capabilities, but it did return the company to user growth. And I think that the fact that it did actually calcified the organization's reticence to take any risky bets even more. So it was a very interesting predicament because when I got into the role, the goal wasn't to change that progress. We wanted to continue reaping the benefits of refining the things about the product that were working really well. What we wanted to change was a lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product was changed at all.

(00:26:58):
Because you would hear people, I mean, one of the beautiful things about working on Twitter as a product is that you have literally customers being injected into your veins. Every single day, whatever you change about a product or whatever you don't change, they're telling you what they love and what they hate. And it is both exhausting and exhilarating. It is one of the most ridiculous luxuries of product development, is working on a product that many people use and therefore you get that much feedback around.

(00:27:25):
And it was a very common thing for us to hear people say, "What are you all doing over there? The product hasn't changed in eight years." And that was horrible to hear, and I felt it too, as a critic on the sidelines, as a user who wasn't an employee who eventually became an employee, I had the same feedback. And so that was my mission. I was like, I am somehow ridiculously in this fortunate position that I've been entrusted some responsibility here. I might flame out completely, but hell if I don't try. And so that was both fun and exhausting, like I said.

(00:28:00):
But it was as simple as starting with we are voracious users of the product ourselves, and if we aren't, by the way, that's its own problem. I think that in order to build something wonderful, you have to be a customer of the product. And sure, I'm sure you could point to businesses and products where that's not the case, and I'm sure there's a flaw in that philosophy somewhere, but I've always believed that one of the best ways to build products is to be a customer yourself and to find your own pain points and to build a product that you want to use. And so that's actually not that hard to do if you're a user of Twitter and you can think critically. It was ripe with opportunity. And so it was actually really fun and amazing to be able to craft a plan that started to take a swing at some of these things.

(00:28:50):
And the other thing I'll add to this is that there were so many sacred cows at Twitter that the sacred cows are their own roadmap. It's like a built-in free roadmap of like, all right, what are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there. Everything from moving from reverse chron to a ranked feed, that was a sacred cow. Text and 140 characters, that's a sacred cow. Not letting anyone control any tweets that they see on the platform. The notion of Lenny owning his reply space was anathema at Twitter.

(00:29:21):
It's just like if a tweet gets, if you get an at mention and you don't like it or it's abusive, we're not touching that. We can't annotate tweets with [inaudible 00:29:30], all that stuff, those are all sacred cows. And the process of starting to address those one by one reveals a lot of the cultural hesitations that existed.

(00:29:43):
So yeah, I'll never forget one of the first features, and this is such a tiny feature that we worked on after I started the role, we were building this feature called hide replies. It still exists in the product today. If someone replies to one of your tweets, in the tweet details area as a reply to one of your conversations, before you had no ability, the only way you could address unwanted content was reporting it. So that was like Twitter acting as policemen and policewoman, completely unscalable and challenging, especially in the context of someone replying to one of your tweets.

(00:30:18):
And so we wanted to add a feature that let you hide a reply to one of your tweets, and it's not impacting what people say. It's not impacting free speech in the sense of you can still broadcast whatever you want, but if you're going to come into my reply space and say some shit that I don't want to see in my feed, I should be able to hide that. Tweet what you want, but don't at mention. You can't scream in my face basically.

(00:30:40):
And I remember we had a PM on our team who was leading this feature who a few weeks into this project mentioned to me that she had had a conversation with someone on the engineering team that told them, "Don't work on this feature. This is bad for your career. This is not going to launch, and you don't want to work on this. You don't want to be seen as having worked on this." Because it was so kind of anathema to we can't let people hide replies to their tweets. And I just remember hearing that and my blood was boiling. That is the most, it was such an interesting representation of the culture, not just hesitation to try new things, which by the way, that product might've failed. And that's fine, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

(00:31:27):
But to go so far as to dissuade someone else who was excited about experimenting with a hypothesis to see if it could help customers on the platform and telling them, "Don't work on this. It's bad for your career." As a microcosm for some of the cultural challenge we had around trying big, bold bets, which by the way, this wasn't even a big, bold bet. It was such an innocuous thing to try. But there was a lot of that and it made it very difficult without some sheer force of will and also just a lot of effort. So there was a lot of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):
Kayvon, there's fractals of stories that I could infinitely follow. There's so much interesting stuff here. One that just stands out is this idea of the sacred cows become your future roadmap. It's like flipping it from here's the thing that we're all afraid of. No, this is not what we should be doing. I think that's really interesting and could be a lesson to people.

(00:32:20):
The other is just, I love this point you made about the growth was most accelerant when you're just focusing on the core, that's what actually ... Like optimize, people bash on optimizing the existing experience and just micro-optimizing, improving, versus trying to take all these big, bold bets and experiments. Obviously, that's also valuable. But I think it's really interesting that that's what reignited growth and was responsible for growth for a while.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:32:44):
And continue to be, by the way. One of the lines that we had to maneuver was creating a portfolio of bets where some of them were not speculative at all. We knew that if we continue to invest in ML and getting better with recommendations in the main feed and through notifications and things like improving the onboarding flow, it was rife with opportunity.

(00:33:12):
You'd have really dumb things happen. We would learn. There was one just bizarre and incredible meeting we had where we finally had got more rigorous around instrumenting our onboarding flow. And we found that in a couple countries, like we had a bug with our SMS verification flow where we wanted to verify users who were signing up with a phone number and our telco integration to send SMS verification cards just wasn't working. And so a huge percentage of people signing up in the UAE and other countries just couldn't use Twitter.

(00:33:46):
And so of course at the scale that we were operating in with hundreds of millions of users, you need to be able to refine the basic building blocks of the product, and that's going to lead to reliable growth. But we wanted to balance that with a portfolio of other bets and product improvements that would materially add new capabilities. And that was a balance that I don't think existed. And by the way, I don't think we nailed it either under my tenure, but it was the driving force of what I wanted to achieve, was to create a better balance that would result in evolving the product and introducing new capabilities. And so that's what we tried to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):
In terms of what actually helped turn things around, things that I kind of gathered from what you shared so far, one is just building a little momentum, having some quick wins of new products that people start to get excited about. So creating more excitement down the, oh wow, we can actually try new things. There's also, it felt like there's a sense of trust that you built with Jack and execs of just like, okay, we can actually trust this team.

(00:34:47):
Also, it feels like because growth started up, there's probably a sense of like, okay, we can try some new crazy ideas. It feels like another part of your strategy was [inaudible 00:34:56] hires and bringing in these entrepreneurial folks to take the lead on some of these big ideas. Can you talk about that? Was that something you actively thought about and was that a big part of the impact there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:35:07):
Totally. Yeah. So I think a couple things. One, the only thing I'd add to what you said in terms of the ingredients, it was also just storytelling and just repetitive storytelling around this is the vision, these are the bets we're making. Here's why. And you can't just tell that story once. I'm talking internally, by the way. There's a whole other component of this, which is externally how do you tell, especially for a product like Twitter where it's a consumer product that hundreds of millions of people are using, and you have many constituents, you have users, you have advertisers. And so it was very important for us to tell the story of here's what we're doing and why. Here's why you should believe in us. And by the way, give us all your constructive criticism too, because we're listening and we're going to build that into ... So that storytelling was really, really important.

(00:35:51):
And this is oversimplifying the world, but there's two types of internal team members. There are people who hear that story, who have been a part of the organization who's been slow, or maybe they've been outside the company as a user of Twitter, and they're like, I'd never really want to work there because it doesn't seem like a particularly ambitious product company. And one of two things happens when you hear that story. Either you're inspired and you're like, yeah, we can finally take a swing at making this product better. And maybe I wasn't interested in working in this company before, but I mean, this is an iconic product, and to have an opportunity to reshape it is really exciting. Or again, oversimplified world, but there are people who are very pessimistic and maybe aren't excited by that vision. Let's just stick to what we know works. We're not going to take any big swings. That's a waste of time.

(00:36:35):
I think one of the really important things about driving cultural change at the leadership level is you've got to identify whether someone's on the wagon or off the wagon and either quickly convince them to get on the wagon or if they're not on the wagon, they shouldn't be there. And that's something that we were terrible at, and we didn't have the organizational structure to be able to enact that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):
The wagon is they're excited and bought into this vision and want this to happen?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:37:03):
Correct, and contribute towards it. And off the wagon is like you're not at the company. And we didn't have an organizational structure that could allow for that, nor frankly, the fortitude. I include myself in this. I feel like I've learned a lot about how to make that determination. So I think we were terrible at that. And Elon is the whatever, if that's a spectrum, Elon is the opposite spectrum of that. His tolerance for people who are not aligned and his tolerance for low performance is famously extremely low. And I think it's one of the things that when I say A/B test, it's very interesting to see the extreme to which he has operated.

(00:37:37):
And I think I've learned a ton around, we didn't have the organizational structure nor the fortitude to be swifter, and that made cultural change way slower. We still were able to change the culture, not as much as we should have, and certainly not as quickly as we should have or efficiently as we should have. Because by the way, a lot of high performers who are aligned with that desire to change and build, they don't have the, there's not like an equal distribution of patients. If you're extremely talented and you're dealing with organizational shit, you're going to go find someplace else that lets you do your craft and have impact. So it's very difficult.

(00:38:16):
But anyway, going to your question, one of the things we found that was a really effective way of accelerating cultural change and also helping drive some of these product initiatives that were particularly speculative was doing small acquires. And really the benefit of that was, A, you bring in a founder type who is an entrepreneur, who drives urgency, who has ambition, who's ideally savvy enough to also work in the context of a large organization, which sometimes is a totally different skillset. I mean, it is a totally different skillset. And a lot of our most ambitious bets that were the riskiest and most misaligned with how the product worked or there was no easy staff to build on top of, a lot of those bets were driven by founders who we basically acquired and said, "Here, you are going to run this."

(00:39:13):
And they believed in it. They were able to rally a team around them, and it's all the attributes of a startup, but with the canvas of a product that hundreds of millions of people use and more resources. So Spaces, Communities, Community Notes, called Birdwatch back then, these were all projects driven by ... Fleets, as well. These were all projects that were run by small teams led by entrepreneurs who we acquired, like Keith Coleman runs Community Notes, last Birdwatch. He actually was my predecessor. We acquired his company so that he could be the head of product. And then when he moved on from that role, he was extremely passionate about this idea of crowdsource moderation and letting people annotate misleading content on the platform without Twitter acting as a policeman.

(00:40:03):
And that was a very speculative bet that by the way, a lot of people thought, most people thought was a terrible idea. We gave Keith a little silo to go build this vision, and then it was our job to make sure that bet didn't get suffocated in the context of a big organization that would otherwise have not had patience for it.

(00:40:26):
All of the community effort or the creator efforts started with Super Follows and tipping, and all these things were led by Esther Crawford, whose company we acquired and who had her own couple of viral moments with the Elon acquisition. But she's a phenomenal leader who, again, is a perfect example of balancing that entrepreneurial startup muscle with the savviness to be able to get things done at a large organization. Fleets was run by Mo Oladam, who's an entrepreneur, and Communities has gone through a few iterations obviously and still is in the product, but John Barnett and a team of people who we acquired from Chroma Labs.

(00:41:02):
So I think that that story of acquiring hungry, ambitious founders and giving them responsibility and latitude is a success story of Twitter's. I mean, I'm a beneficiary of such a bet as well. My company Periscope was acquired, and I was given the responsibility to eventually lead the product team. So I feel like that we ended up realizing, both through the company's history and through learning, that this is actually a very effective way to drive cultural change and to deliver impact because you need a special type of person to be able to both operate within the existing structure and change the structure, to know when to use the system and to know when to fuck the system.

(00:41:52):
And I feel like my whole life has benefited from other people taking bets on me like that, to the point that even I was like, "Really? You sure you want to?" And so I think I've enjoyed trying to pass the buck and do that for other people, and I've never regretted it. You always, taking a bet on people and especially throwing them in a deep end, which on paper they may be unqualified for, I think is one of the best ways of driving change. And by the way, supporting growth, you've learned so much more when you're thrown into the deep end than in other contexts. And so I think it's fantastic, it's an expensive strategy if you're going to go buy a bunch of companies, but it's a great strategy for the situation that we found ourselves in at Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
It feels like every big bet was one of these companies from the list that you just shared, and I'm glad you shared Periscope, obviously. That's a great example, too. I guess maybe just a follow-up question here, is there anything you learned about how to do this well? I know you talked about maybe creating a little silo for the team, because so many companies acquire and acquihire and they just go nowhere.

(00:42:59):
So I guess just a two-part question, just like what are some tips for how to do this well at a company? And then, two, you also, we were talking offline about this previously and I think it's a really interesting point, that a lot of companies staff based on who's available versus who is right for the role, and let's wait until that person is there for us to bet on this. Can you just talk about lessons there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:43:19):
That last one is a huge pet peeve of mine that I feel like we learned the hard way, and particularly it's a common pattern I think in highly functional organizations where you have different people making decisions on how to staff projects, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. But I think in the situations, in the situation we found ourselves in where we had this sort of cultural evolution that we were going through where some people just didn't agree with the things that we were prioritizing, they were begrudgingly going along with it, but you would end up in a situation where the combination of that sort of cultural shift and strategy and the fact that the way teams were being staffed was not, there's ultimately no single decision maker other than the CEO and Jack is not going to get in the weeds and debate a staffing decision on the team, resulted in a situation where oftentimes we'd have projects, like the one I mentioned about hiding replies, where there wasn't even an agreement on the team about whether this was a good idea and whether this is worth trying or how to do it.

(00:44:22):
And imagine, it's hard enough to build something from nothing. It's even harder if the team doesn't believe in it. This is to the point of just being toxic. The startup would never succeed if all the people who are working on that startup aren't to the point of being perhaps irrational obsessed with that idea. And still willing to see truth, you need to be able to see whether the thing is working or not, but if you don't believe it in the first place, I'm not betting on that succeeding.

(00:44:50):
And so this was common, and sometimes not as extreme as the examples that I mentioned, but I think one of the lessons I learned, and it's quite intuitive actually, is you need to staff projects with the team of people that are well equipped from a skillset standpoint, but more importantly have an obsession with the idea they want to pursue. It's going to make them work harder, it's going to make them be more creative. It's going to make them have the sufficient level of ambition and desire to will this thing into existence. Because every project, whether big or small, there is an element of you need to will this thing into existence because it's hard. The only way you're going to get through that pain is by having that desire, and I think a very easy cheat code for an organization to employ is to say, if you're going to work on something, especially if it's speculative or risky, staff it with a set of people who believe in it and really want to learn whether this solves a customer problem or not. Because if you don't have that ingredient, it's going to drag everyone down and it's just not going to be as successful.

This kind of touches on something I wanted to touch on, which is jobs-to-be-done. This is maybe one of the most recurring controversies of the podcast, is jobs-to-be-done amazing or is it really bad and not something you should do? We've had many guests share their opinions. I feel like at Twitter, jobs-to-be-done was implemented so strictly that it burned a lot of people out on it. It's like, oh my, this is not anything anyone should ever do. I'm curious, just your lessons and experience of just with frameworks in general, the jobs-to-be- done specifically, maybe even OKRs.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:47:31):
I've only seen one interview on your show that covers this. Sriram was particularly spicy when he talked about jobs-to-be-done, which is unsurprising because. I spent a lot of time talking to Sriram about jobs-to-be-done. I mean, I guess I'll just start by saying I was not a fan of how we leveraged jobs-to-be-done at Twitter. I thought it was exhausting and not particularly helpful, and so it's a particularly sore subject for me because I was sort of charged with defending it and rolling it out. It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something. But...

Kayvon Beykpour (00:48:00):
It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something, but to me the critique is less about Jobs-to-be-Done though there are many critiques of it and more about every framework at its limit is followed to such a religious extent it's just unhelpful. You need to have nuance in how you leverage these frameworks. Otherwise, you lose the forest through the trees and you end up following a process for the sake of following a process. And that's what happened with Jobs-to-be-Done. So I think that's my real critique of it. It's not the... I mean listen, the premise of Jobs-to-be-Done and my most charitable take on Jobs-to-be-Done, which is actually useful is that it forces you to look at things through the lens of customers and understanding what their needs are and understanding what their true alternatives are outside of the narrow lens of your product.

(00:48:47):
And I think that's just healthy product thinking. You don't need a framework called Jobs-to-be-Done. You don't need to think about milkshakes in order to be able to do that. It's like you could employ common sense or you could leverage something like Jobs-to-be-Done, to be able to force your mind to think of things through that lens. So I think that's my charitable view on what Jobs-to-be-Done can help you do, but as a framework into and of itself as a sole governing principle of what to build, it's just not useful.

(00:49:14):
By the way, in the same way as, and I think Twitter had this problem as well prior to our detour around Jobs-to-be-Done, if the only way the organization is trained to think about what to build and what not to build is OKRs, it's equally unhelpful at the limit because sure, you can have a good sense of what you should build to drive metrics, but by the way, you might be focusing on the wrong metrics or that might not help you have the right balance of things to build. That might not help you see when the things that you're building are actually hostile to customers.

(00:49:47):
So just as an interesting example, the thing that I remember about your interview with Shriram, if I'm not mistaken, I think he mentioned, and I love Shriram, I'd be happy to debate him about this on his podcast, but he mentioned one of the examples I think was the Amazon. When you get order confirmation from Amazon, they intentionally bury the order details. You have to click the link and authenticate to go see what you ordered. I don't give two shits what metrics that drive for Amazon. That is one of the most customer hostile things I experience in my daily life. I order a lot of things from Amazon. I hate the fact that I can't search my email to see what I ordered. And so I think the problem with these frameworks is that you lose nuance and ultimately, and this is where I agree with Shriram, he actually mentioned this on your podcast as well, you need to be able to make trade-off decisions that balance what's right for the organization and what's right for the customer.

(00:50:43):
And sometimes based on how you devise your frameworks, your metrics aren't actually aligned with the customer's benefit. Like the Amazon example, and we had many famous examples in Twitter's history, which were the same. One of our key metrics that we always optimized Shriram growing was DAU and we had obviously the rank timeline did wonders for growing DAU and it was a great experience for many customers, but we often had features that would not lead to a good customer experience and the team would just be blind towards leaving hostile customer experiences in place because it was good for metrics and aggregate. And the famous example of this is we had this toggle, which we called Swish very affectionately, but it was like a sparkle icon.

(00:51:26):
Before you could switch between the rank timeline and the following, that reverse chronological timeline, which is still in the product right now, it was just the toggle. You would press a button and it would turn your feed reverse chron, which very few people use as a percentage of our users. But you had power users who really cared about having a reverse chronological timeline and we took so many baby steps on the evolution of this product. The very first baby step was you press the toggle, it turns you to reverse chron and then we would pull the rug out from underneath you and make the experience go back to the rank timeline after, I don't know, 24 hours or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:02):
Oh, wow.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:52:03):
And the reason that the team felt strongly about keeping it this way is it was better for metrics. Why? Even if Lenny wants a reverse chron feed, we knew that he would spend more time in the app if we put them in the rank timeline and this was the number of debates that we had about this because the team understandably was like, "This is good for metrics", but at the same time you'd have customers being like, "I fucking hate this experience. I'm telling you I want reverse chron. Stop randomly changing it for me."

(00:52:34):
Instagram has I think gone through their own struggles with this as well. They tiptoed their way towards ultimately giving people control and the difficulty in making product decisions comes down ultimately to making these trade-off decisions and you have to look at things through the lens of the customer. You have to balance that with what's driving the right business outcomes. And sometimes those things are aligned and sometimes they're not, and the answer isn't any one framework. Sometimes it's just good old-fashioned judgment and product taste. And so that's where my take is different. I don't think the issue is Jobs-to-be-Done, although I'm not the biggest fan of Jobs-to-be-Done. The issue is just having the right nuance and ultimately the right leadership to be able to weigh these things and see when your frameworks are not actually helping you make the right decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:20):
I think that's really important advice and I love hearing the details if I actually think about this stuff. Actually finding this balance is very hard in practice. I'm curious if there's something you could recommend or have learned about how to know when you've gone too far with a framework like signs like you have implemented this to religiously and maybe you should be thinking a little more broadly.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:53:41):
There's two, I think, simple and obvious ones. One is if the result of your framework is that subjectively bad decisions are being made, then something's got to change. Assuming the person who's making this assessment has good product taste, which is in of itself subjective obviously, but my personal view on this would be in the role that I had, if I saw that our organization was being incentivized to make decisions that to some non-trivial degree of the time were just bad decisions that I don't like as a user, I can't stand by as a user or builder, then something's got to change. Either bad judgment was made in following the process or the process was wrong, or if that framework, it didn't even lead to the right debates, then that's how you know. Either you have an incentive problem but the team did what they were incentivized to do or that there was bad judgment and that's a different problem obviously.

(00:54:38):
But I think in the situation we found ourselves in where the team was again understandably hyper focused on driving DAU because that was the strategy for so long. It left so little room for even taking ambitious bets that in the short term wouldn't drive DAU, like some of our bets that I still to this day believe in hurt DAU in the short term, but you had to squint and believe over time would improve some metric DAU or otherwise, like a product like Spaces. In order for Spaces to be actually used, you needed to make sure that when Lenny starts a Space that people would join. And how do you get people to join Lenny space when they're used to having an asynchronous feed of tweets? Well, you can send push notifications, you can occupy really trying real estate at the top of the app that lets people know, "Hey, Lenny's live right now. He's in a space, there's people here, come join."

(00:55:31):
Guess what happens when you put a bar at the top of the app that tells people when they're live? You move tweets down, you move ads down, DAU goes down, revenue goes down. And so if you have an organization that's just hyper focused on the thing that matters is driving DAU quarter over quarter, then that doesn't leave enough room for nuance to accommodate new speculative bets that might hurt one metric, but over time have other consequences that are positive and beneficial, like enabling an entire new vector of content creation and conversation on the platform. I guess the other answer to your question in terms of how do you know when the framework's not serving you right? When you start imagining and planning for a bunch of bets that the organization then sees is disincentivized to make successful, then something's got to change.

(00:56:17):
Either your strategy is just not the right strategy because it doesn't abide by the frameworks or the framework needs to accommodate the fact that actually we're going to try some things that in the short term either might not show up as blips on our DAU radar or are going to help some other metric that's important. And so that took us some time to get, and we tried a variety of schemes to make that work. Community Notes, the project that I was mentioning Keith started, we intentionally structured that like a startup. It was literally like we made a seed bet on Keith and his team and we were like, don't worry about the OKRs. We're not going to judge you on the basis of your OKRs.

(00:56:57):
And there's some pros and cons to that. A lot of our projects worked that way. Fleets started that way. Community Notes started that way and some other projects started more part of the core organization because they were so intertwined with how we were the nature of the product that it just made sense to... Separating it was going to do more harm than good. So you just have to figure out based on how execution is going, whether you've got the right framework and you've got to be willing to make adjustments when it's not working.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That's actually really helpful. The two that I'm taking away here is how often are you feeling bad about the features you're shipping? Like they're bad for users and you think they're bad for you as a user potentially. And the other is it keeping you from taking big bold bets that don't necessarily drive the metrics you're focusing on. Okay, so before I let you go, I want to spend some time on Periscope. I don't know if everybody knows the history and story of Periscope. Basically it was the biggest live video streaming platform in the world and I imagine inspired basically every other social network to build a live-streaming platform, Instagram live, Facebook, TikTok, obviously Twitter. So I want to spend a little time here and see what you learned and also just broadly consumer products, but first of all, I hear there's a story with Kobe Bryant and Periscope about him using it in some form. Can you share that story?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:58:18):
Before Periscope launched publicly, which it was in March of 2015, I want to say, we had a small beta that grew to maybe 500 people in total before we actually released the app publicly. And in that time while we were still in beta, I was trying to personally onboard every single user and I had a shtick that I did, which was we'd get them in the app and I would start a broadcast. We had a feature called Private Broadcasting that we basically built for this use case, which is someone joins, I'm going to go live and they're going to join and I'm going to show them how the app works. And we were spending a lot of time in our office, so Kobe, Chris Saka actually invited Kobe to the beta.

(00:58:59):
And so Chris connected us and I did a private broadcast and Kobe joins and I was like, it was like 10:00 PM in the office and my routine was like, let me just walk around the office talking through the mechanics of Periscope through the lens of this demo of like, "Hey, let me show you around the office and here's how the chat works and you can tap the screen to send hearts and if you want me to do something, go to the room over there, just type it in the chat and it'll come up."

(00:59:22):
And sort of showed one of the things that was unique about Periscope was it was a one to many broadcasts, but still low latency enough that it felt like a FaceTime so you could have the bidirectional communication between multiple viewers and a broadcaster. And so I was teaching him how to use the chat and showing him the office and he was playing with it and at one point through the end of the demo he posts a comment that was like, "Why the fuck would anyone want to watch someone else stream live?" And I remember my heart sank and I started fumbling through like, "Well, we think it's cool."

(01:00:03):
And before I could even get the words out, he posted like, "I'm just fucking with you, bro. This is incredible." And I just remember it was just such a surreal moment that has, I'll never forget, I mean Kobe's a legend obviously, but to have him essentially troll me while also putting a point on what was cool about the experience and that was bidirectional and something he commented on to cause the broadcaster to change their behavior or change the experience, it was a really ironic full circle of showing off how the product works. But yeah, it's one of my favorite early Periscope stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
Oh man, if I kept doing that, the manual onboarding, I'd be like, "Who's coming?" Just always worried that someone else fancy is going to join. You never know who Chris Saka is getting, who he's talking to. That's amazing. Okay, so it's been about 10 years, I believe, since you sold Periscope and about six years ish since you stopped running at as CEO, something like that. Now as I shared, every single platform basically is doing this. They added live video streaming. I'm curious if there's anything you learned about just competing with these major platforms.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:01:14):
Well, there's a few reasons why Periscope failed ultimately and why we shut down the app. Obviously Periscope, the technology and the mechanics still lives on because you can go live on Twitter, you can watch live broadcasts on Twitter, you can do audio conversations on Twitter and all of that is the Periscope stack. Still there, which is awesome that the legacy lives on in a different form factor. The reason that the Periscope app failed, it really comes down to a few things. One, we did not address the core problem that retention wasn't good. Our poor retention was mapped by just an incredible surge in top-line user growth. And for Periscope, it was interesting because every month or two we would blow up in a new market that would just bring along an incredible surge in usage.

(01:02:02):
We blew up in the US, we then blew up in France. We then blew up in Turkey. We then blew up in the Middle East and you had these incredible surges, but underneath that surge, the core product had retention issues and we ultimately just did not, we didn't spend enough time prioritizing, addressing those. And in fact, we shipped product changes that made those retention issues worse. Compounding that was the fact that one of the theses behind our acquisition, the Twitter acquisition, was that we would leverage the scale and the community and the product mechanics of Twitter to make the product grow faster and also become more durable. And I think that's connects to one of the reasons why I feel like one of my learnings and one of the things that we knew but just failed to execute on was that I still am very skeptical that there can be a consumer product that is just focused on live video, like a generalized synchronous live video application for short form video I don't think can be durable on its own. I think you have to surround that product with enough features and capabilities to allow a community and an ecosystem of users to be able to stay in touch with one another asynchronously and synchronously. This is why a lot of the other products that you mentioned that incorporate live capabilities and we're shameless about copying. What was working about Periscope, they're surrounded by a scaffolding that lets people also stay in touch with each other. Asynchronously Instagram, it's an asynchronous product that has synchronous features like live. Same with TikTok obviously. And I think we were in this position where it was a live only product.

(01:03:39):
You are connecting with your audience and having a great time when you're broadcasting live, but you're not using the product to keep in touch with that community when you're not broadcasting. How often throughout the day would you broadcast live from your phone? And mind you, this is different for products that are live. There are live consumer products that focus on a specific vertical like whatnot for selling or Twitch for gaming that have very different properties that make it more durable as a standalone live product. But Periscope was really in this consumer generalized live-streaming from a phone land, and I think it was just not durable to have the product be live only. And the time it took us to integrate with Twitter was way too long. And there was reasons for that that come down to just how distracted Twitter was with its own roadmap and refining the core and they just had other fish to fry basically.

(01:04:32):
And all of that leads us to competition because at some point Facebook woke up and decided this is cool and we need to go build this. And I obviously wasn't there on the inside, but legend has it, Mark says, "Hey, you 300 people, stop what you're doing. Go basically make live exist in our product as a first [inaudible 01:04:56] experience."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):
Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:04:57):
And if you have that level of organizational effort put on building something that by the way, you don't have to spend any time wondering what the product looks like, just go copy these features basically and make them work. And they did a lot of other savvy things too from a partnership standpoint. We had a lot of prominent streamers that ranged from influencer or just creative people that became known on Periscopes, all the way up to celebrities like Kevin Hart and others who were prolific Periscopers that Facebook just went and bought out.

(01:05:30):
They were just like, "Cool, we're going to pay you a bunch of money to stream exclusively with us." So they hit us from all sides. They had the entire company put their effort towards building live in a way that was cohesive in the core product first with Facebook and then Instagram and then also attacked it from the creator as well. And we were too slow and it was very painful to think about because it was like many other insights that Twitter had early. Twitter had the right insight, but botched the follow through. I'm not pointing fingers, I blame myself for that just as much, but there's a pattern where Twitter is really great at spotting meaningful consumer behavior changes. They spotted Vine and acquired Vine, botched it, spotted Periscope, botched it, spotted Instagram by the way, before Facebook tried to buy Instagram, Twitter was trying to buy Instagram, and there are other reasons why that didn't fall through, but it's interesting to me, it's one of the interesting aspects of Twitter's history.

(01:06:35):
They were phenomenal at spotting meaningful changes in consumer social behavior, and actually putting their money where their mouth is in terms of trying to follow through on bringing those bets in-house, but then botching the execution. And so that was one of the things that was really motivating for me when I was in my role leading product of Twitter was I didn't want to make that mistake and we didn't end as up buying anything like Vine or Periscope and keeping the product. We obviously bought lots of small acquirers, but we did obviously have a bit of a story with Clubhouse that ended up with us building Spaces and competing with them. But anyway, that was a long, rambly story. Hopefully that answered your question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):
Yeah, there's so many. Again, it's all these fractals of thought threads I want to follow and ask you about. Real quick on the Vine and Periscope point, I was going to ask this. Twitter, as you said, had the opportunity to win in video in so many ways. Vine was amazing, killing everyone, loved it, and then it's fades away. I guess, you already shared a lot of challenges Twitter had with executing, shipping, Secret Cows, things like that. Is there anything specific with video? Was it just like, oh, this is not actually a huge priority and we're just going to ride it for now and that's why it didn't work out? Or is there anything more that?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:07:53):
No, it's even more like pathetic than that 'cause I think Twitter did believe in video, but it made this classical mistake that we also unfortunately recreated with Periscope, which was they had the insight around short-run video, they bought Vine. They then competed with Vine internally. So Vine was a separate organization within Twitter, separate office obviously in New York and then Twitter rather than integrated holistically into the product and pour gasoline on it, they built a native Twitter video feature that was a different stack, different team. It became what you think of as Twitter video now. It's like the most simple active uploading video and all the professional video tools called Media Studio that let publishers like ESPN put content. All of that was basically built as a separate team, separate organization, separate product that was competing with Vine. You had two visions for short form video that were manifesting, and that's the quickest way for things to get messy.

(01:08:58):
And of course the separate startup team is going to get, you're not going to be able to make good on the vision of buying the company and integrating it in all the right ways if you compete with it internally. And we had a similar thing happen with Periscope. We were very focused on Periscope with separate organizations, separate structures, separate app. Periscope at the time primarily was focused on UGC live video. So user-generated content being streamed from a phone. Twitter then decided to get in the premium live video business very famously with acquiring rights to Thursday night football, the NFL. Guess what happened? We competed internally rather than have a cohesive technical and product vision for how to embrace live video across the spectrum of UGC and premium live video, Twitter put a separate team in charge of premium with a separate product, separate technology stack. And so you had two ways to manifest live video on the product. It was like UGC live video, which was awkwardly not even really implemented well with Twitter at the time. And then premium live video, which had totally different UX, total different team, totally different architecture. And by the way, the company put a tremendous amount of energy and investment in talking about Twitter being a place to watch the NFL. And meanwhile you had this burgeoning UGC ecosystem, so this was like we're making the same mistake all over again. Now, luckily in the Periscope case with a lot of persistence and impatience and table pounding, we eventually fixed that mistake, but we wasted a tremendous amount of time. It was just a lot of headbutting in politics and eventually it took us a lot of time to technically reintegrate things together and now it's clean and awesome, right?

(01:10:48):
ESPN can go live with behind the scenes content at Wimbledon and it's the same technology stack and the same user experience, the powers, Lenny going live from his iPhone. But I think that was one of the reasons why it was an example of failed execution that ended up wasting time, resources and just leading to a subpar product experience that other companies I think have avoided making such mistakes. Facebook being a prime example, as frustrated, I am with them as a competitor for having really taken over the use case for live video. Got to hand it to them, brilliant execution, have a lot of respect for them. So we made sure to not make that mistake moving forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):
I imagine there was reason for that. Partly I imagine this calcification of just like, we can't get you done, we just need to start a new team and do this thing. I imagine it always comes from like, oh, this makes sense. And then you realize, okay, this was a terrible idea down the road.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:11:47):
Yeah, it's that and also leadership. When you don't have unified leadership around these things, you end up making decisions that are in conflict with one another. They're just need a highly opinionated person at the top that avoids that kind of messiness from a.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:12:01):
That kind of messiness from a product and engineering standpoint.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):
You mentioned Clubhouse, so I think what's interesting is one, many people copy Periscope as a product. I don't know if you'll describe it as copying, but it feels like spaces very inspired by Clubhouse. Do you have just a current philosophy on when it makes sense to be super inspired by another product and build it into your existing product versus like, no, you should not do this?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:12:30):
I think it's always about doing the right thing for the customer. Everyone has always been shameless to be shamelessly inspired by other people's ideas. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think copying ideas can be done in poor taste and can be done with taste. I think some of the people who copied Periscope did so in poor taste, can't blame them. I wouldn't have done it the same way, but it worked. So you can't say it's the wrong thing. I think that it's possible to take ideas in good taste and take ideas in poor taste.

(01:13:07):
And I think with Clubhouse, we actually had been working on audio. Audio was one of those bets I mentioned that we structured very separately with a team of people, many of which were the former Periscope team, that when we wound down Periscope, I felt very strongly that there was still something to the idea of synchronous conversations. Because one of the famous things that I think we botched with Periscope is that we always... Our dream and our vision for Periscope and how we talked about it was was a mechanism for teleportation. You could see through someone else's eyes and be teleported somewhere else. It was like that was the story we told ourselves. That was the thing that inspired Periscope. And to a certain extent, a lot of people did use the product for that way. You could go see what it was like someplace in the world where it was something amazing happening or civil unrest happening or some important moment happening with breaking news or otherwise.

(01:13:58):
But it turns out the vast majority of our users were not using Periscope that way. It wasn't a rear-facing camera experience where you were showing someone the world, the vast majority of people were using it to just talk to other people. They were bored or they were lonely and they wanted to just have a conversation with other people. And it turns out video and audio is a very interesting way of doing that that allows for more nuance, more long-form conversation, more in-depth conversation, especially in contracts to Twitter, which has mechanics to really incentivize quick, snappy broadcasts that don't lead to much depth. And so when we shut down Periscope, we were like, man, we really need to enable a new form of conversation on Twitter that has some of those properties. And so we had a team that was working on a project that we sort of code named Hydra. Hydra because there were multiple heads on this monster and those heads are participants in a conversation.

(01:14:54):
And so well before Clubhouse was on the map, we had many different iterations of both video and audio only experiences that just didn't feel right, weren't working right, but we felt like we were onto something. And when Clubhouse came on the map, it really re-centered, it put into focus a user experience that felt a lot more right and now give them complete credit for that. Paul and Rohan and that team did an exceptional job crafting an experience that really enabled that mechanic and that premise of enabling these longer form conversations to shine. And so we did shamelessly seek inspiration from what they had done and what had worked and we put our own spin on it. The execution of Spaces within Twitter I think has some similarities, but also really took advantage of the mechanics that you had available to you in Twitter. It's a different product. And so we took the ideas that we felt were shortcuts to making the experience work and then we put our own spin on it. And so I have no problems with what we did there.

(01:15:55):
And having had experienced the pain of not moving quickly enough with Vine from the outside and Periscope having lived that experience, we were not willing to not be the winner with this use case. It is one of the projects I'm most proud of that we worked on at Twitter because we were very radical in our execution. Hydra went from this tiny project that six people were working on that no one knew or care about to, we made Spaces as the number one priority of the company literally above any other project period. And we put a bunch of people on accelerating that product and making it come to life within Twitter. And a lot of that was having felt the pain and burn of fucking this up with Vine and Periscope. And so I'm really proud of our execution. And it was also really energizing. I hope for the company to see that, wow, we pulled that off. So yeah, it was good. It was nice to have that full circle experience and also nice that, personally, I love that aspects of Periscope continue living on within Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):
I did not know that. That is extremely interesting. Speaking full circle, when I joined Clubhouse the first time, Paul was there introducing me to Clubhouse and exactly the way you described Periscope, so I feel like he drew some inspiration from you one step back.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:17:30):
Paul's amazing. I feel like we're kindred spirits and I could see... It was one of the things I love about that team is just you could just feel how palpable their excitement was and their passion was for what they were building. Another universe we could have worked together more closely, but I think what they built was incredible and we took inspiration from it for sure. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:58):
So you've built some of the most successful, most beloved, most used consumer products. You continue to help other founders with their product. I'm curious just if you have any advice for how to get better at building consumer products in terms of maybe craft a product, product sense. What have you learned about what it takes to build a successful consumer product?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:18:19):
The best cheat codes for getting better at building products is just being a voracious user of products. And just trying new things, feeling out what works well, what doesn't, what you like, what you don't like. There's just no replacement for that. It's such an effective way of honing your own taste and seeing what's superficial but not useful, what's ugly but useful, what's beautiful and useful. And you hone that by having practice and building muscle memory. And so I think there's not a lot of science to it, I think. I mean obviously science can help you become more effective at lots of things. But I feel like I've just always been very curious about trying new things. I'm a very hungry consumer of new things that people are building and I'm not quick to judge. I'll try it even if it seems dumb because sometimes things that seem dumb at the beginning become very meaningful.

(01:19:20):
And so it's always been a very helpful cheat code for me. And it's also just personally interesting. Every tool, even the silly ones, people put their heart and soul into it and it's like an expression of themselves and it's always interesting to see that, to see people's creations and to learn from them and see what you like, what you don't like and how you might create something of your own that borrows from that. So if I could give people any advice through the lens of what's worked for me, it's that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:51):
Speaking of trying new things, what are you up to these days?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:19:55):
I'm building something in the consumer space. I started the company with a couple of co-founders late last year. We're not quite ready to talk about it yet, but hopefully you'll be hearing from us pretty soon. But it's really nice to be back building something again, particularly building something with a small team again after seeing the opposite extreme with a really large company. We've just talked about lots of large company things. But yeah, hopefully you'll be hearing about it soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Oh man, I think this is breaking news. So mysterious and exciting. Kayvon, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:38):
No, no, I think we've covered quite a bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:42):
We have. We have indeed. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:46):
I'm going to take a sip of water and then I'll be ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):
Okay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:54):
I love reading sci-fi. I just feel like sci-fi and mystery books are so healthy for jogging the imagination. And so some of my favorite books are by Neal Stephenson, I love Cryptonomicon. I love Reamde. I love a book called Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, which is more like a fantasy book, but I just love escaping reality and thinking about sci-fi, thinking about fantasy is just, it's helpful for the soul and helpful for the imagination. So those are some of my favorite reads because it helps me. I feel like in some weird circular or wandering way, it helps me be more creative and imaginative. And by the way, that's true outside of reading as well. Some of the content that has shaped me, I feel like and help motivate my curiosity and a lot of things I built is sci-fi TV, right? Star Trek is incredible. We used to use as a metaphor for what Periscope was, we would think about Star Trek. It'd be really cool to be able to teleport or get beamed somewhere else in the world and we're not smart enough to go build that device, but what's the closest approximation to that that we can realize through software? Live streaming. So I think that kind of literature or content has always been inspirational for me and I think getting that through books is really healthy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):
On that note, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that's inspired you in addition to Star Trek back in the day?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:22:37):
I mean the most recent movie I saw in theaters was Dune Two, and it was incredible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):
I just saw that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:22:41):
It's insane. I also thought Oppenheimer was... I'm a huge Nolan fan. Oppenheimer was captivating. To have that level of high octane in a biopic consistently for two and a half hours is so hard to pull off. And I thought it was exceptional. TV shows we're watching Tokyo Vice right now, which I really like. I think one of the best TV shows I've watched recently, I mean Succession was amazing, but maybe I'll pull a less popular one, which is Devs also in the sci-fi realm. I think it was a Hulu show. But if you're interested in tech and AI and you want great acting in Nick Offerman, Devs is a pretty amazing show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):
I haven't heard of that. Have you seen 3 Body Problem yet, by the way? It feels like it's squarely in your wheelhouse.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:33):
I haven't seen it yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Okay.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:35):
And it's funny, some content people are talking about it so much that I kind of want to not watch it now because I feel like it's really hard for shows to live up to the hype when you're mid-hype cycle. So I haven't gone around to it yet, but it's definitely on my list. I know it's the type of show that I would love, but I just haven't gone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):
Okay, great. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates you're hiring?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:58):
The thing that I find is both very illustrative and helpful is just asking people to talk about something they worked on that failed and talk about something they built that succeeded as well. But I think you just learn a lot about self-reflection and their passions. But particularly their self-reflection. If they talk through something that they really cared deeply about that didn't work and why didn't it work? What were the takeaways? What did you learn from it? I think it teaches you about how willing people are to take risks. It tells you have they experienced failure, what they learned from failure. And so I think it's always, you just get to know someone really well. It ends up in a well-rounded understanding of a person, if you can dig into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):
Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:24:51):
I love Proplexity. It's really interesting to me how Proplexity is a product that fits in your life and replaces a product that is so ingrained in people's behavior, which is using Google search for some set of use cases. And it's just really incredible to me how quickly Proplexity took that over. It is very hard actually to rewire your muscle memory if you're used to using Google for searching for 15, 20 years or whatever. It was just amazing to me how quickly my go-to became Proplexity. And frankly, it's one of the only non-development tool AI products that actually has retained. A lot of people try and consumer AI products that just aren't really, haven't retained. But Proplexity is one that it's a daily driver for me. It's on my home screen and I love it. I'm very impressed by it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:45):
Also a huge fan.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:25:46):
Yeah. Here's a bias one, my wife is actually working on a startup called Particle, and they're the news experience with AI. And what I love about what they're doing is that for the first time they're like they've rethought what the form factor and the unit of content for news stories should be. Articles are a failed format, is my belief, and certainly their belief. And so they've really come up with an elegant and engaging experience for understanding what's happening in the world in a way that's purely powered by AI. And it's awesome. Again, hashtag biased husband, but it's amazing. It's in beta right now. You can sign up on the wait list. The URL is particlenews.ai. They're letting people in on beta. If you sign up, use coupon code hashtag #KayvonLenny. That's not a real code. But yeah, so that's amazing. So that would be my second pick.

(01:26:48):
I'll give you a non-software one, which is actually a board game that I ran into, that I was gifted actually for my birthday. And it's called Crokinole. Have you heard of this game called Crokinole?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):
I have not.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:01):
So Crokinole is Canadian. I think it's a Canadian board game and it's amazing to me because I've never seen a game be captivating to all age ranges. I love it. I play with my friends. My parents over Christmas were obsessed with this game. My daughter loves. It's a physical game. You flick a puck, like shuffleboard style, but miniaturized with a totally different set of mechanics. And it was just like seeing this game captivate, people of all age ranges was mind-blowing to me and it's really fun. So maybe a curveball answer for you there, but I think those are some of the products that I've been really enjoying and appreciating lately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):
These are awesome answers. What's the name of that game again? I'm going to-

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:48):
Crokinole.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:53):
Okay. I don't don't know how to spell it, but I'm sure Google will help me figure it out. We'll link to it in the show notes.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:56):
C-R-O-K-I-N-O-L-E.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:59):
Great. I love the K in there. That makes it really fun. And by the way, I think it's also Particle.news looking at it. It's so cool. It's basically bullet points of news items and then it links to all the articles that have written about it. So it just summarizes, here's the things you need to know and it's beautiful.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:28:13):
Yeah, basically they consume and aggregate everything that's happening in the world by among other things, ingesting articles and then crafting these story modules through them that are summarized by AI. And then they let you actually interrogate the news and ask questions. So leveraging LLMs and tool calls, it's able to actually help you understand what's happening in the world. And they also are building a social layer as well. So it was very cool. I'll definitely get you in the beta.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:39):
This is actually amazing timing, because I was a huge fan of Artifact, the news app, and they're going away, so this is the next news app, so thanks for sharing that. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with people that you find useful in work or in life?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:28:57):
Something that definitely shaped my work ethic and how I work that came from my first boss actually. When I was 14, I had a summer job basically replacing and doing maintenance on fire extinguishers. So I would drive into San Francisco, my boss would pick me up in his truck, we'd go to big commercial buildings, hospitals, high rises, and we would take all the fire extinguishers in the building, hundreds of them to the garage, empty them, fill them, tag them, inspect them. And that was my first job. And I don't even remember if I was getting paid. I was probably getting paid very small amount, but it was just first work experience. And I remember there was this moment that I had finished dealing with my extinguishers and I was just sitting in his truck twiddling my thumbs doing nothing. And my boss came up to me and was like, when you've got nothing to do, sweep never sit around.

(01:29:57):
And it was so funny, it was just very tiny moment, but I've never ever forgotten that. When you got nothing to do sweep. And it had such a profound impact on my work ethic of there's always something you can be doing to move the ball forward and being productive and being impactful. And I'm so grateful that Fred, my boss, had that moment with me. It was like, I don't even think he understands how impactful that was, but it felt so much a life motto, but it definitely stuck with me and shaped how I work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:35):
I love that you shared that story. I found that quote and story in GQ Magazine turns out is where you talked about this and I was going to ask about it and I didn't and I'm glad you shared it because I love it.

(01:30:47):
Final question, we're going to go full circle. Scott Belsky, you're friends with him. What's something people would be surprised about or don't know about Scott, that might be interesting?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:30:58):
Well, I'll tell you one funny story and then I'll first tell you something I love about Scott. Scott is a great example of someone who I think has driven immense cultural change at a massive, legendary company in Adobe obviously. But the number of transformations that Scott oversaw and led and contributed to at Adobe are incredible. And I'm sure having a fraction of this experience at Twitter, I can appreciate how difficult and challenging and rewarding that was, right? Going from package software to cloud, going from non-AI to AI, going from discrete tools to an integrated suite that worked really elegantly together. I think Scott oversaw a lot of this stuff and it's pretty incredible to see that transformation have been so successful at Adobe. So I love that.

(01:31:55):
I guess a funny story about Scott that people might not know, I consider him to have been the first Periscoper. So Scott believed in Periscope before it was Periscope, before we had turned it into live video, we had a previous version of our beta that was static photo sharing, same vision, same concept, but the product was called Bounty. And it was like you put a pin somewhere in the world like the Tokyo fish market and someone would respond with a photo of what it looked like there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:25):
I didn't know that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:32:26):
Our vision was still to help you see through someone else's eyes, but the first manifestation was really static and had this marketplace dynamic, and it took us a while to get to the point where we were like, press a button, go live and have it be live video because by definition it's real time rather than static.

(01:32:42):
Anyways, before we built any of that, when we were playing with the idea and Scott was encouraging us to go in this direction, I remember probably the second time I ever met Scott, we did it FaceTime and he was at the TED conference, I want to say it was in Vancouver, and just to illustrate how cool it would be when he accepted the FaceTime and he's like, "Cool, and I'm going to take you on a Periscope." And he flipped this camera and started walking around the TED conference and basically pretending like he was prototyping the product, but using FaceTime. And it was such an amazing experience because having an investor essentially encourage you down a product direction by showing rather than telling, it was such a great encapsulation of how supportive Scott was and inspiring Scott was as one of our cheerleaders. And I respect him so much for everything he did to help Periscope make happen, and also for betting on us, because he was one of the first people who said yes to investing. He didn't know us, he just believed in us. And that helped everything else come together. And yeah, he's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:48):
What a mensch.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:33:48):
What a mensch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:49):
We've got to get him back on the podcast. The story reminds me of your Elon's story, where he FaceTimed you, and it also makes me think about your lesson of building consumer products, just using it, being obsessed with it, Scott, just like, here's what it could look like. And actually using the product, not just talking about.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:04):
Yeah, he's a great example of that as well. He's definitely a gracious user of all tools and products, and that's why he has really great, really great product sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):
Kayvon, you're amazing. This was so freaking fascinating. There's so many nuggets here. Can't wait for folks to hear this.

(01:34:20):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more and maybe follow up on anything if there's things you want to follow up on potentially? And then, how can listeners be useful to you?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:30):
People can find me on Twitter/X/whatever we're calling it these days. My handle is @kayvz, K-A-Y-V-Z. And yeah, if you're of this podcast and you're working on something cool and you need some help or advice or you're looking for an angel investor, don't hesitate to reach out and would love to try what you're building.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:51):
Amazing. And also check out Particle.news.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:53):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:54):
Support the wife.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:55):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:56):
Amazing. All right, Kayvon, thank you so much for being here.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:59):

# An inside look at X’s Community Notes | Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
The work that you guys do has had such a tremendous impact on the way the world works. I want to start with just giving people a brief understanding of what is Community Notes.

Keith Coleman (00:00:09):
Someone on X can see a post. If they think it's misleading, they can propose a note that they think other people might find informative. Other people can then rate that note.

Jay Baxter (00:00:18):
We actually look for agreement from people who have disagreed in the past. And what we see is when people actually have that sort of surprising agreement, that's what makes the notes so neutral and accurate and well- written, really, overall.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
There's many people that are very polarized. How do you deal with people that are super anti-vax, super Jan 6?

Keith Coleman (00:00:36):
One philosophical thing that's important is that we want all of humanity to participate and sometimes people are surprised by that. We have all of humanity. We then have the data to understand what notes will be helpful to actual humanity. Every post is eligible for notes. We shouldn't exempt Elon. We shouldn't exempt government figures. We should be like everyone... Even advertisers can get notes.

Jay Baxter (00:00:58):
There have been external studies run by people totally independent of us who have found that if you take a post with or without a Community Note, that actually people's agreement with the core claims in the post does change if they see it with a note versus without.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):
Is there anything else along the lines of just working for Elon within an org Elon runs that might surprise people?

Keith Coleman (00:01:18):
If I were to start a company in that company, it would be even leaner than I would've made it before. I've been amazed with just how much the team is able to accomplish with a small group and I think because of a small group-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guests are Keith Coleman, Product Lead for Community Notes, and Jay Baxter, Founding ML Engineer and Researcher for Community Notes. This conversation may be my newest favorite podcast episode so far. Community Notes is one of the most impactful and clever and, also, underappreciated products in the world right now.

(00:01:52):
If you ever use X/Twitter and you see a note underneath a tweet correcting the misinformation in that tweet, that is Community Notes. I've never heard a deep dive into the story behind the product and the team that built it and I'm excited to bring you just that. We get into the surprising origin story of the product, how the algorithm actually works, how the algorithm emerged out of an internal contest within Twitter, the principles behind Community Notes, and why staying true to them has been so key to its success. Also, how it survived four different leaders, including Elon and Jack, and why it's now a big part of the solution to solving misinformation on the internet. Including recently being adopted by Meta as their main fact-checking tool. This is an incredibly special episode and I'm so excited to bring it to you.

Keith and Jay, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Keith Coleman (00:05:23):
It's great to be here. [inaudible 00:05:25].

Jay Baxter (00:05:25):
Thanks for having us on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):
It's so my pleasure. I'm so thrilled to be having this conversation. The work that you guys do has had such a tremendous impact on the way the world works. So many product teams are always talking about driving impact and want to drive impact. You guys have actually built things that have changed the world in meaningful ways and continue to do that. And I've never really heard the backstory of how Community Notes came to be and how it works and all these things, so I'm really appreciative of you guys making time to chat.

Keith Coleman (00:05:52):
Yeah. First, thanks for saying that. That's why we built this thing is to help people and it's great to hear it. It's great to see people enjoying it and finding it useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:02):
I want to start with just giving people a brief understanding of what is Community Notes. I think a lot of people kind of heard about it, kind of maybe see it on X. As they scroll through, they see these notes but they're like, "I don't actually know what this is." So can you just briefly describe what is Community Notes?

Keith Coleman (00:06:18):
Community Notes is a way for the people, like the public, to add context to posts that might be misleading. The basic way it works is that someone on X can see a post. If they think it's misleading, they can propose a note that they think other people might find informative. Other people can then rate that note. And if the note is found helpful by people who normally disagree with each other, indicating that it's probably accurate, it's probably really neutrally-worded, it's probably informative, then it will show to everyone on X. The goal is just to get people more information about what they're seeing so they can make better decisions in their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:57):
Amazing, and I think hearing this, it's absurd that this works. I think when people originally heard this idea like, "No way this is going to work." And so, just to dive a little bit deeper, can you give us a deeper understanding of how it actually works? Because I think it's the algorithm that you guys designed that is so clever that allowed this to work. So talk a little bit about that algorithm.

Jay Baxter (00:07:22):
Yeah. So I think a key misunderstanding a lot of people have if they haven't really dived into details, they just think that maybe someone can write a note and it appears immediately or we're just taking a majority rules vote of who thinks the note's good. I think both of those approaches would probably lead to biased or inaccurate notes. I think the key thing, really, that we do is we actually look for agreement from people who have disagreed in the past.

(00:07:48):
And what we see is when people actually have that sort of surprising agreement, that's what makes the notes so neutral and accurate and well-written, really, overall. It's just that people who are very polarized, overall, often can't find agreement when things aren't accurate, right? I think it also provides some good anti-manipulation properties. I think people are often... If you said... I think back in 2020 before we started building anything here, whether this could work at all, I think a room of ML engineers would say, "Oh, you have to keep it closed source. People are going to be manipulating this all the time. You have to use ground truth labels from fact checkers. There's no way that you could bootstrap the system without external labels." But it turns out that you can do that with this kind of bridging-based agreement algorithm is what we call it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:41):
Okay. So just to summarize and make it super clear. It's basically people... Someone writes a note. This information is fault... What's a good example, just as we talk about this, like a classic example?

Keith Coleman (00:08:50):
A really classic example is an AI generated image or an out of context image like, "Look what's happening here." But it's actually from five years ago in a different country and a different topic or something-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:00):
Oh, man. I've seen this so many times where it's like, "Look what's happening in San Francisco," and I'm like, "No, this is a whole different city and that's not-"

Keith Coleman (00:09:06):
Totally. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):
Yeah. Okay. So someone posts this AI image. Someone writes a note, "This is actually five years ago in a different city," and this algorithm helps understand if this note is true and it's just regular people doing this.

Jay Baxter (00:09:23):
Yep. Regular people who have signed up to be Community Notes contributors. So there are a few checks, like you do have to have a verified phone number for instance. But yeah, at the end of the day, these are regular people. Not necessarily professional fact checkers or anything like that.

Keith Coleman (00:09:40):
And yeah, that was really important to us too. There was a question at the beginning, to the point Jay was making of like, "Did anyone think this was going to work?" Obviously, it was a crazy idea. We didn't know if regular people were going to be able to do this task and certainly people had concerns about whether they would do it effectively.

(00:09:58):
Initially, some people inside the company were suggesting like, "Hey, why don't you have journalists or some select group be the first participants?" But very specifically we were like, "No. We're trying to move away from the idea of curated editorial decisions being made around this. This is supposed to be open to everyone." So we very intentionally try to allow all humans in. People are randomly selected and that's important to it feeling fair, feeling open, feeling trustable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:27):
Yeah. And again, it's just like this sounds like the holy grail of understanding what is true and it actually works. And works so well that Meta recently, as you all know, decided to adopt this exact system for them instead of having tens of thousands of fact checkers reviewing things.

Jay Baxter (00:10:46):
One distinction that I would make, which maybe can come off as nitpicky but I think is important, is Community Notes adds additional context. It's not fact-checking necessarily, right? So there are cases where the post could be true. But maybe, it's just misleading because there there's no context or there's missing context. We cover those cases and I think that's an important distinction. We just have the philosophy that users should be able to make up their own minds, right? Like, "Here's extra context, take it or leave it," right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):
Yeah. What I think about, you shared this with me, this example of a picture with a cat and somebody's Community Note was just, "That's a dog." Or is it the other way around or that's a-

Jay Baxter (00:11:31):
Yeah. "A Palestinian boy shares his bread with a dog," was the post and it's a picture of this cat. So obviously, this particular note is not super necessary because it just says, "That's a cat," and links to a Wikipedia for cat. It's a good example that the system is... This is not something a professional fact-checker or whatever or you think would need fact-checking. But it's proof that the system is really run by the users at the end of the day and adds some comic relief, I guess. And the note is correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:06):
Okay. It's important.

Jay Baxter (00:12:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:08):
When does a post get triggered to even be considered for Community Note? Is there a threshold or is it just you can write a Community Note on anything and people decide what they would vote on? How does that work?

Keith Coleman (00:12:19):
So every post is eligible for notes and that was, again, another really important principle. It's like, "We shouldn't exempt Elon. We shouldn't exempt government figures. We should..." Everyone, even advertisers, can get notes. So any posts on the platform can get a note. And if you look in practice, you'll see notes appearing on world leaders, on Elon, on ads, on media organizations, and on, obviously, just regular people using social media. But yeah, the idea is really that it's an even playing field. For a note to be proposed, the person proposing it has to have earned the ability to write notes. So there is that aspect where you have to earn in to be able to do this. And the way you earn that ability is through your ratings by demonstrating the ability to help identify notes that are found helpful to a broad range of people. So basically, if you have an ability to see and know, recognize what's helpful with a lot of people, then you have the ability to start proposing notes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):
I actually signed up to be on... What do you call these people? Note take-

Jay Baxter (00:13:24):
Contributors.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:25):
Okay. Contributors. Yeah. So I've been rating. I haven't achieved-

Keith Coleman (00:13:29):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
I can't write notes yet.

Keith Coleman (00:13:30):
Yeah. It's not super easy. It takes some effort.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:33):
Are there stats you can share about the scale of Community Notes at this point, especially things that might surprise people?

Keith Coleman (00:13:39):
Yeah. I mean, the service is growing rapidly, so there are hundreds of notes per day. And to put that into context, I saw some stats recently from someone at UC Berkeley saying there was something like 10 traditional fact checks a day. So in contrast, there's hundreds of notes a day that are getting shown. They span a huge range of topics from, obviously, politics, news, out to entertainment, sports, gaming. Just whatever is going on that day.

(00:14:07):
In addition to there being hundreds of these individual notes, they can also be matched to multiple posts. So if someone writes a note on an image or a video, like let's say it's AI generated or something like that, that note will automatically be matched to all posts that contain the same image. So you can have a single note matching to thousands of posts. And over let's say the last year, 2024, we had something like 95,000 notes that were seen about 30 billion times. That's more than double the prior year. Prior year was something like 37K notes seen 14 billion times. So that rate is increasing dramatically when you think about 30 billion views, that's a lot of information that is getting out there that might not have been out there otherwise, which is pretty cool. And part of the reason it is expanding like that is the contributor base is expanding. There's something like 950,000 contributors around the world. That's nearing a million people making this happen which is amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:13):
Wow. And I'm one of those, right? I count as a contributor?

Keith Coleman (00:15:15):
Yeah. Yep. No. If you're signed up as a contributor, you count.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:16):
Okay. Cool.

Jay Baxter (00:15:18):
Then, there's more people on the waitlist too. So there's plenty of headroom for more growth. Regarding the matching on media and URLs, I think that's a huge way to get extra coverage. Also, I do think we've been very careful to make sure that those matches are precise. Because I think one thing that people love about Community Notes compared to other types of fact checking is that, actually, the notes are custom written for the particular claim you're seeing, right? So often, a fact check warning would just say something like, "Get the facts here." And then, there's a link to some generic page about voting information, which is so not helpful to have the information behind a click. So pulling the context up so that you have zero clicks that you need to make and keeping it specific is so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):
One feature I love that I imagine you guys thought deeply about is if I liked the post in the past, I get notified later if a community note shows up, so that I'm not remembering this false information.

Keith Coleman (00:16:22):
Yeah. I mean, we try to make notes as fast as we can, so we want them to appear instantly if possible. But inevitably, there's going to be a time gap between when a post goes live and when people figure out what's going on and when they get the note out there. And so, we send those notifications to try to close that gap. And yeah, we get a lot of love for that. We see people take screenshots and share them. They're excited about it. And it's also a pretty cool example of something you can do on the internet, in the social media world that was difficult in a print or standard news world where you would see maybe a correction the next day in a corner of a paper that was hard to read. Here, you're getting a ping about it if you've engaged with a post and note shows up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:05):
One user feedback point is I'd love the push to just tell me, "Here's what you got wrong." Because I find that I actually have to go into it and read it and I feel like the push could just be like, "Here's more context to this thing." You're like-

Jay Baxter (00:17:20):
Agreed.

Keith Coleman (00:17:20):
We'll go take a look at that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:21):
There we go. Live user feedback.

Keith Coleman (00:17:24):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:25):
Okay. I want to get into the origin story of this whole thing. But two more questions, because we're on this thread. One is what's the the threshold for a note to show up on a note? Is that information you can share, just how does that work?

Jay Baxter (00:17:35):
So just because of the details of the way the algorithm works, it uses this machine learning algorithm called Matrix factorization where we fit it with Gradient Descent and whatnot. The threshold is it's 0.4 on this made up scale-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:52):
0.4. Great.

Jay Baxter (00:17:53):
Yeah. I mean, in practice, what it means is basically a majority of people... If there is a polarized divide relevant to the notes. Obviously, some notes are not about politics or something polarizing. But if there is, then a sizable majority of people on both sides would generally need to find the note helpful. And then, there are other rules that come into play beyond that main one. So even if it's above that threshold, it might get filtered out if... There's a separate algorithm that's looking at agreement between people's incorrect tags. So like maybe people found the note helpful but incorrect, right? It happens. And in those cases, it doesn't matter if it's above the helpfulness threshold.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:39):
This is probably the wrong way to think about it, but is it 40% of people that normally disagree, agree-

Jay Baxter (00:18:45):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
Okay. It's-

Jay Baxter (00:18:45):
It means nothing like that. It's just like on some arbitrary scale-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:48):
Okay.

Jay Baxter (00:18:48):
Yeah.

Keith Coleman (00:18:49):
Yeah. If we change random other things about the algorithm, that number would also have to change to an equally seemingly arbitrary number. We arrived at some numbers like that by gauging user feedback. So we could share a lot of notes with people, get feedback on which ones are helpful, and just a line emerged about indicating where things go from questionable to pretty clearly helpful.

Jay Baxter (00:19:13):
Yeah. And it is set right now, by the way, to be really conservative, I think. We just are pretty particular about quality and we really want note quality to be really high. I think Keith and I both believe that we live or die based on the quality of the notes at the end of the day. So we'd rather not show a note that maybe good, but we didn't have enough signal on than the other way around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
That makes so much sense. I've never seen a Community Note that is wrong and breaking that promise is a big deal. So I completely get why you guys are super conservative there. Okay. Two more questions [inaudible 00:19:53] because I'm just curious. These weren't on my list of questions to ask, but I feel like people wonder this. How many notes are written versus end up showing up and triggering on a-

Keith Coleman (00:20:02):
We probably show about 8% of notes that get proposed. It's been between, let's say, 7% and 10% or 11%, something like that over time. The number can vary a little bit. And as Jay said, there are undoubtedly... And you can see it, there's clearly more good notes than we show, but the goal is to hold a really high bar. We want to show a note when it's going to be helpful, when it's not going to appear biased and undermine trust in the system. We want these to be neutral, informative, helpful. And as Jay was saying, we view the worst possible mistake as showing a bad note because that's going to undermine trust and the trust is why people like the product.

(00:20:47):
So yeah, the bar is there. And like I said, there's clearly some in that remaining, let's call it 90%, that are good. And then, there's a lot that are just not that great and there's some that are bad. And if you write one of these ones that are bad which bad being defined as people who normally disagree find the note not helpful, so it's like the inverse of the ones we show. If you write one that people normally disagree, find not helpful, you actually will ultimately lose your ability to write and have to earn it back. That other 90% is a mix. Sometimes people look at the number, they're like, "Oh, why don't you show more?" It's like, "Well, you probably actually don't really want us showing most of those." The gold here is that the system is able to filter out the good ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
That makes sense. Okay. One other question is there's many people that are very polarized, like very disagreeable with a lot of things. How do they filter into this algorithm? How do you deal with people that are super anti-vax, super Jan 6, like all these very extreme potential views?

Jay Baxter (00:21:47):
If people really are so polarized that there isn't agreement among people that typically disagree, it's possible that this is one of those notes that might be correct, but it wouldn't be helpful to show as context. Maybe it's about a claim that people have really entrenched opinions about and they've read hundreds of things about it already.

(00:22:15):
Probably this is just not going to improve people's understanding. It's just not going to be a helpful user experience. So it might not be the worst thing in those cases to not show the note. People, a few years ago, were pretty pessimistic that maybe fact-checking never changes people's understandings about what's true. Actually, there have been external studies run by people totally independent of us who have found that if you take a community note or posts with or without a community note... That actually, people's agreement with the core claims in the post does change if they see it with the note versus without. So we are having an impact on this thing that people previously thought was maybe not so easy to do.

(00:22:59):
And so, it's nice to focus on the cases where there is the bridging agreement. I would also say there is this reputation component to the algorithm as well. So if you consistently rate notes in a way that is counter to the bridging-based consensus, then we will stop counting your ratings. So if you're the kind of person who constantly rates bad notes as helpful, we do filter you out. So there's a difference between those types of people versus the good but polarized ones.

Keith Coleman (00:23:30):
Yeah. I think one philosophical thing that's important is that we want all of humanity to participate. And sometimes, people are surprised by that. They'll be like, "Oh, aren't there people who shouldn't be doing this?", or like, "Their thinking is so extreme or something, maybe they shouldn't participate." But our view is it's actually we want to have all of humanity here. Because if we have all of humanity, we then have the data to understand what notes will be helpful to actual humanity. We can better model that better or better understand and better show those notes.

(00:24:03):
So it's advantageous to have people who have all sorts of points of views and we don't expect that every note will be loved by every single person. That's an impossible bar. But we do intend to show the notes that 80% of people are going to read and say, "Wow. I'm glad I knew that." And so, in that sense, it doesn't matter how maybe extreme someone views a person's views as. It's still great to have them in the program. So no matter what your views are, please sign up and participate. It helps identify what's really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
Cool. And we'll link to people if they want to actually sign up, so they know how to do this. Something we didn't actually specify, these are all volunteers. No one's getting paid to be doing these notes and voting, right?

Keith Coleman (00:24:49):
Yeah. It's totally based on intrinsic motivation and we think that's a great reason to be doing it. When you talk to the most active contributors, a lot of them, they want to have better information out in the world and that's a great motivation. So yeah, that's why they... If you think about, like for these people, the impact they can have is nuts. So when we first launched US-wide, this was like in 2022, a note appeared on a White House tweet and the White House deleted the tweet and reissued an updated statement.

(00:25:25):
Imagine being the person who wrote that. You probably have 12 followers. Your posts probably get a couple likes. And here, you just put a note on the White House and they changed their public talking points based on what you did. That is an incredible amount of impact. So you could see why people are motivated to do it when they care about what's going on in the world. You don't have to be a big, well-known person to shape the discourse and information flow in a way that's helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
It's insane. There's so much to love about this. One is just the meritocracy of this whole operation of just anybody that is true and correct can participate and have impact. Also, it just shows you how much information we get that is just wrong. We had no idea how often we see things that are wrong and now we do.

Keith Coleman (00:26:18):
Working on this product has made me realize just how many things I used to trust by default, that now I look at more skeptically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:26):
Definitely mean these days. Okay. Before we get to the origin story, is there anything else along those lines you guys think might be really important to share, that are really interesting?

Jay Baxter (00:26:36):
Sure. I guess one other thing is that although we don't actually use the fact that a post was noted in the core ranking algorithm, which we think is a nice property. There is a really big impact just organically, meaning not from the algorithm but just from user behavior, where people will like and re-share or quote posts way less when-

Jay Baxter (00:27:00):
Quote. Posts way less when notes are applied. I don't know, for people out there who typically run A-B tests on big platforms, you may already be familiar with this, but 1% is typically an awesome effect size for any algorithm change. We saw more like 30 to 40% engagement rate drops for likes and reposts in A-B tests we were ran when showing a post with or without a note, which is just crazy big. That's just an A-B test on the engagement rate, so that's not the network effect. If you capture the overall network effect of how post spread less by that person's repost, basically if you look top line with a difference in differences approach, multiple different external research groups have both found consistently that there's a 50 or 60% drop in total reposts, which is just nuts after a note is applied. It's having a really big impact on spread actually, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):
That's so great to hear. It's what I would want to see and it's incredible impact. Basically, an AI image of something false would just go crazy on Twitter, and did before Community Notes came out, and now what you're saying is just adding that context, not actually... Like you're saying, the algorithm doesn't demote it. If there's something incorrect, it's just people are like, "Okay, this is false, why would I want to retweet this?" That makes sense.

Keith Coleman (00:28:28):
Correct.

Jay Baxter (00:28:29):
Right.

Keith Coleman (00:28:29):
Yeah, the notes just totally take the wind out these stories. The thing will be going viral, note appears, resharing drops 50 to 60%, and that's it. At 50 to 60% per generation, the virality quickly goes to zero.

Jay Baxter (00:28:45):
By the way, I have very mixed feelings about this next one, but authors become 80% more likely to decrease, sorry, to delete their post after they get noted, which okay, that's great, because less misinfo out there, but I'm pan about, because those are usually the best notes. If the note was so just good that you had no other option but to delete your post, those notes don't get seen by other people, right? Because-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:13):
That's hard.

Jay Baxter (00:29:14):
There's an argument, by the way, that seeing... Just because you might see the same misleading claim elsewhere off X, or somewhere else on X, it might be good to actually show... Better to have seen the post with the note than not see it at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:28):
Yeah.

Jay Baxter (00:29:29):
Unsure about that claim.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
That is so interesting.

Jay Baxter (00:29:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):
Yeah, I'd be so sad if I was that community note writer and just... Man, it's so good. They just can't even keep the post up. Okay. Coming back from today's world, where this small amount of code is changing the way people understand the world and what they believe, and making the White House rescind their announcements, zooming back to the beginning of how this whole project started, what I heard just briefly is, Keith, you were just tired of managing PMs, you wanted to just work on something yourself, you wanted to work on something impactful away from corporate BS, and you basically just started looking for something that was impactful, important, and you found this. Talk about just how it all came to be at the beginnings of the story.

Keith Coleman (00:30:19):
Yeah. I mean, for me, the beginnings actually go back to why I joined, it was then, Twitter in 2016. I had a startup and we'd had some acquisition offers, and one of them was from this company, Twitter. It was 2016, it was the middle of the election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and there were something like three televised debates, but every day, there was a debate happening on Twitter, and it was very clear, this is where people are talking about these things that matter, where information is being shared, where ideas are being formed. As a user, it was obvious that I could get good information there, but it was also obvious that there was questionable information floating around. I remember just looking, as an outsider, thinking like, "Wow, this is a really hard problem and it also seems really important," so we ended up going to Twitter and the company was in a turnaround at that point.

(00:31:21):
My first three years was just helping to get the company growing again, working on everything that was the consumer product, getting user growth going back and people wanting to work there again, et cetera, but a few years in, I was reflecting on what we had done. I think we had done a lot of good work getting momentum going, and people in the us and in the industry had tried things to deal with misleading information, but nothing was really working. It was obvious nothing was working. Nothing could handle the scale of the problem, nothing could handle the speed, and a lot of people just didn't trust the existing approaches. The existing approaches were either fact-checkers or internal trust and safety teams making decisions about what was or was not misleading. A lot of people just didn't want or trust that to be the way this was decided, which is very reasonable.

(00:32:19):
I'm looking at that, I was still managing a large PM team. That's a whole story in itself. That job required a lot of energy in, and I didn't feel like I always saw the output that I wanted to see from it. I didn't see the change in the product I wanted to see and I was contemplating, "Should I go start a company? Should I do something else?" And I kept coming back to this problem. I'm like, "Man, how is the world going to deal with this information quality issue of what we get on social media?" Wherever get it. I'm at this company where you can make a difference on this problem, why not go and try some crazy ideas and see if one of them might work? I had a kid, I came back from paternity leave, I went to my boss, Kayvon. I was like, "Hey, Kayvon. How about I just stop doing my job and I go work on this instead? 'This' being trying some crazy ideas to see if we can deal with misleading info."

(00:33:24):
He was stoked, so I went off and started working on that. It started with just reading any research I could on the problem and existing solutions. What was or was not working, what were the issues, and then into prototyping. Then it ultimately led to us building and piloting this idea that became Community Notes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
Amazing. I have so many questions and we're going to keep going through the story, but when you joined Twitter, what was the... It was called Twitter. At this point, I'm going to try to call it X now, which I know is important to your boss. What era of Twitter was it at that point? It was Kayvon joined and who was the CEO? Because there's been many.

Keith Coleman (00:34:05):
Okay, yeah. I came in December 2016, so Jack had relatively recently come back as CEO to turn the company around, and just to give you a sense of the state of the company, something like a third of employees were leaving every year. Just imagine a third of your team gone every year. The stock was in the toilet, the product was not really growing, so Jack was working on a turnaround and Kayvon was there already. Kayvon was running Periscope with a bunch of video stuff, and that group continued to... Jack was there up through the start of the Community Notes, then Birdwatch Project, and... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:50):
Okay, and it was called Birdwatch. I don't think we've used that term yet, but that's an important point. It was called Birdwatch initially.

Keith Coleman (00:34:55):
Yeah. It was originally called Birdwatch when we started the project, but obviously, somewhat famously the name changed along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:05):
Yeah, maybe let's just tell that story real quick, and I know we're zooming it forward, but just... I have this Twitter thread that I saw between Jack and Elon when they're debating what to call it, and Elon's like, "Birdwatch sounds creepy, I want to change it". Is there anything there you can share?

Keith Coleman (00:35:19):
Yeah, the story there... The story, that's funny. Elon came in, acquired the company, and we had just launched the product relatively recently in the US. It had been in pilot for a year, but we had just made it available US-wide, and I guess he'd been seeing the notes. Soon after the exhibition, he DM'd me and he was like, "Hey, this Community Notes thing is awesome," and I was like, "I'm glad you like it, let's talk," so we talked the next day and he kept referring to it as "This Community Notes thing." I was like, "It's interesting you keep calling it that, because that's actually the very first thing that I called it." The very first figma mockup I made depicting this thing was called "Community Notes." I don't know why, it just felt really natural, so that's the first prototype we had tested.

(00:36:14):
Later, the project changed the same to Birdwatch, but Elon was like, "Hey, let's just call it that." The next day, we just changed the name. It's always notable for the team when you change the name, but really, the team was excited about it. I think it is a much more understandable name. Jack has made fun of it, calling it "The ultimate Facebook name," or something like that.

Jay Baxter (00:36:41):
The most boring Facebook name [inaudible 00:36:44].

Keith Coleman (00:36:44):
Boring name, which is funny, because they're now launching Community Notes. I think it is a very understandable, intuitive name, and I think it has served the product really well. There's a reason it was the name in the very first mockup.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:57):
Yeah, I think descriptive names just makes sense. This connection with Elon, and I want to talk later about just how you've dealt with so many strong personalities over and kept this alive throughout so many changes, but before we get to that, you did something that I think a lot of product leaders, angel leaders, just people that have managed people dream of give up all this power, in air quotes, and career trajectory and influence and just, "Forget all that. I'm going to go back to just building something awesome, small team." Is there any advice there that you could share from that experience that you think might be helpful for other leaders to share or to hear to help them maybe do that same jump? Because that's really difficult in practice. Easy to talk about, hard to do.

Keith Coleman (00:37:42):
Yeah, I think it is a difficult jump. I've done it a bunch of times in my career and I've always been very happy with it, where I started with a small team, that it grew into something bigger, and then I was like, "We're dealing with a lot of big production stuff, team's really big. I want to go back to doing something like crazy and new with a small team again." I've done that sawtooth leap a bunch of times, but it can be hard, because certainly, the natural... The classic career path is, I don't know, rewards or running a large organization or being a manager, or things like that, but I think, at the end of the day, you got to work on stuff you love, you got to be having fun, and I think people want to be having impact.

(00:38:29):
I think there's one myth that can get in people's ways. The idea that the more people you manage or the larger your scope is, the more impact you have. I definitely do not think that is true. I mean, look at Community Notes for example. If I had stayed running a large consumer PM team, what would I have produced? 16 more pages of OKRs? I don't know, a bunch of documents? I think building Community Notes has had way bigger impact on the world. It's become the industry standard for how to deal with this now, which is super cool. People love it, it's the first thing that is plausibly dealing with the internet-scale issue of information quality. I think it's unquestionably a bigger impact than I would've had if I were just doing whatever, doing some standard management track thing like I was doing before. I think that's true of so many other small companies and startups. Someone screenshotted I think it's Blake Scholl's LinkedIn the other day. He went from director of coupons or something to building the first supersonic-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):
Yeah, from Groupon.

Keith Coleman (00:39:41):
Those stories are everywhere when you look, so I definitely have found that, for me, I love building hands-on, I love trying crazy new ideas. I love the zero-to-one experience. It's fun to scale things up too, and it can be fun to operate at scale, but this team is a good example of one that operates at a very large scale, but that is still very small.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
Yeah, I think the way you guys operate is what more and more companies are trying to do, remove middle management layers, create small teams that just execute and build impact, just like Ics. Whenever I say IC, I have a comment on YouTube, where like, "What is IC?" I'm just going to explain, individual contributor, non-manager is when I say the word IC. Let me follow this thread, and when I asked people about how you set up the team to operate effectively and protect it initially, there's this term, "Thermal," that came up a lot. It was like a thermal team, if that's how you describe it.

Keith Coleman (00:40:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:38):
What is thermal?

Keith Coleman (00:40:39):
Yeah, so anyone who's worked in a larger company probably knows that things can get bureaucratic or bogged-down, decision-making can be slow. There's these large planning cycles, people can try to take someone from one team, move them to another at random arbitrary times that can disrupt a project, all sorts of things like that. Our company, this is a number of years ago when we started this project, we had a lot of founders in the company. Kayvon is an example of founder who is helping to run the company, and he had this idea, "Hey, why don't we create this program, call it Thermal, where we could have teams that were somewhat isolated from that." They could run through their own process, they would have one clear owner. The team would be entirely dedicated to that project and we would just repeatedly make funding decisions as to whether to continue the effort.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):
Why was it called Thermal, by the way? What was the idea there?

Keith Coleman (00:41:35):
I think it was an old bird analogy of thermals lifting the bird on their wings. Twitter 1.0 obviously had a lot of bird analogies, bless its heart, so that was one of them. I loved the idea, as someone who liked the startup environment, so when we were starting this project, I was like, "Hey, Kayvon. Why don't we make this the first Thermal project?" And he was like, "Yeah, let's do it," so we started with that way of operating and it gave us, from day one, a lot of freedom and autonomy that I think was really important to make the product work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):
Just be very specific about it. What makes it a Thermal project? How do you set that up? This is asking from perspective, if a company wants to build their own something like this, what does that look like?

Keith Coleman (00:42:24):
Yeah, I think there's a bunch of key attributes. One key attribute is there's one clear driver of the project, who's effectively a founder. I guess maybe you could have two or something, but really clear, there's driver of the project and also there's one clear decision-maker that they go to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:43):
Outside of the team?

Keith Coleman (00:42:44):
Outside of the team. That was true back when we started and it is true now. If we need something or have a question about something, I talk to Elon. It was like that from the beginning, it's like that now, and I think that's a big reason we're able to make decisions effectively, quickly, in a simple way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:02):
It probably has to be someone very senior, not [inaudible 00:43:05] manager.

Keith Coleman (00:43:06):
Someone senior who can make the decisions you need made, whatever they are. I think that's really important, that clear decision-making structure. Another was 100% focus, so everyone on the project is expected to be totally focused on it. A lot of companies, it can be easy to have people's attention spread across a bunch of things, and it makes it hard to get stuff done. You'll talk to whoever that person is, you'll ask them for help on something, and they'll be like, "Yeah, I'll help you. I got to finish this thing, and it'll take me a week or two and then I'll get to it." A week or two delay totally changes the momentum of a project. When we were 100% focused, we talk in the morning, it's like, "Hey, Jay. Why don't we try this thing in the algorithm?" He's like, "Yeah." Then that afternoon or the next day, we're looking at results.

(00:43:59):
Because of that total focus, the rate of iteration goes way up. Then beyond that, there was also just the ability to use whatever our own decision-making process was. We didn't need to write OKRs or... For others standard practices. Obviously, we had to make sure we were responsibly building the product and everything, but we didn't need to use the standard practices. I think that's another great example, OKRs, I understand why they can be helpful, but they can also be not necessarily the right cadence at which to set goals. I think it's really unclear that quarterly or annual goals are actually the right pace. We would set the goal for the next milestone that mattered, and we would work on that. We reached that milestone, we would have an idea of what was coming after, and then when we hit that, we'd set the next milestone. Whether that was two weeks, a month, three months, whatever it was. We set our own pace and goals at that pace, and that just I think is a lot more natural for the development of something.

Jay Baxter (00:45:06):
The whole OKR determination and planning process took longer than it would take us to pick a goal and then execute on it and finish it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
How big was the team early on that you set up? How many engineers?

Keith Coleman (00:45:19):
It started with just me and then, when we decided to build the thing, we figured we needed about five. We wanted it to be as small as we possibly could. It was clear we needed someone on ML doing scoring, it was clear we needed someone to do some client engineering work, someone to do backend engineering work. There may have been one or two other. We needed a designer and a researcher to help us understand the customer base and make sure we were building the thing in a way that was actually going to resonate with people. I think it was backend, frontend, ML, design research. That was the original team, from what I remember.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:01):
Amazing. Basically, one of each function. A question I have for Jay, actually, is there's all this talk of small teams and moving fast, but sometimes you just need more engineers to build the thing. Is there anything you've learned about just how to keep a team small while moving as fast as you are, and not need or need to hire more engineers?

Jay Baxter (00:46:22):
I think, in the beginning when we were iterating on what should even the requirements be, it was definitely good to just have one ML engineer, but I think, at some point, we got clear on what the goals of the algorithm should really be and we tried... I think, at the very beginning, it wasn't clear that we needed to build this bridging-based algorithm. The actual first algorithm that I put into production was very focused on anti-manipulation. It was this page rank variant, but it didn't solve the problem of bias, basically. If there are more users on one side, a page rank type graph algorithm can actually amplify those biases. I think, after building that prototype and getting data from that, it was clear that the bridging-based algorithm was going to be the way that we needed to solve it, and at that point, basically I set up a bake-off. Kind of a Kaggle competition or something. That was the key time where it was really important to pull in other engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
That is such a cool story. I want to follow that thread. Before we do that, you just mentioned you guys yell "Thermal." What does that mean? Is that YOLO, like a version of... Okay.

Keith Coleman (00:47:43):
We're just going to ship, because we're thermal project.

Jay Baxter (00:47:46):
Ship it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):

(00:48:52):
Okay, so coming back to this algorithm, this is actually really interesting, because I've never heard any of this. I was going to ask just what inspired this actual algorithm, and you basically did an internal competition amongst ML engineers to see who had the most successful algorithm. Netflix-contest style, Kaggle style.

Jay Baxter (00:49:09):
Yeah, yeah. This particular idea of finding content that is liked by people on opposite sides of a polarized divider who typically disagree, this was not an idea out of thin air. I think Keith had found some of Chris Bale's work, he had made this list of accounts that were often liked by people who were on both sides politically. There is other projects, like polls out there that look for agreement among people who typically disagree, but I think that it wasn't obvious that our project definitely needed to use that from the very beginning. When you implement it and compare it against these other type... PageRank seems, obviously, it's designed to be manipulation-resistant. Naturally, if you just have a voting ring of people who all vote themselves up, then PageRank can filter that out very well, but that just wasn't the main attack vector, I guess.

(00:50:15):
We had to get some real data from the pilot to realize that, "Okay, the real thing going on here is people are polarized," so it was only once we got that, the real data from the pilot, that I think it was clear that the bridging-based algorithm was the direction we really needed to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:34):
I want to come back to the way you operate the team. I hear that you run the whole team off a single Google Doc that's like a four-year-old doc that you just keep adding goals to, bullet points. Is that true?

Keith Coleman (00:50:47):
There is a very long-running doc that has had to be chopped and purged, because it was breaking Google Docs in Chrome at various points in time. It's like a note-taking doc. It's really where we coordinate what we're doing. The team meets on a daily basis, we spend whatever amount of time we need to get on the same page about what we're building. We might talk about anything from what's most important right now to, "What should we work on next?" To, "What are we trying to launch right now, and why is it not launched? What's in the way of launching it?" We might review new modeling or scoring algorithm update and try to understand what's working in it, what's not. We'll just cover whatever we want or whatever feels most important. As you said, we set our goals very dynamically, so whatever seems like the most important thing for us to work on now and next is what we spend our time on. I think that's served the project really well versus feeling attached to some quarterly goals, or something. We'll look at, "What is going to help people the most?" Or, "What's the biggest problem right now?" What are either one of those? And we will go tackle it. We might change our roadmap multiple times in two weeks based on what we see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:08):
I'm hearing no Jira, no Asana, no Monday.com.

Keith Coleman (00:52:11):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:12):
Okay.

Keith Coleman (00:52:12):
Yeah, I mean, we have to use Jira to coordinate with some other teams. Sometimes when we file a request, we have to make a Jira ticket. But no, I am not a fan of heavyweight task management. I love being on the same page, being able to keep most things in my head, and having a really light way to write down the things that the team can't keep in its head.

Jay Baxter (00:52:34):
We did use Asana briefly, but my memory of it is that you spent more time in the meeting grooming a backlog of irrelevant stuff than actually talking about the proper priorities. I think it's nice in the Google Doc that, if something becomes irrelevant, it can just fall off without needing explicit backlog grooming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:58):
Just to maybe summarize a little bit of how you guys operate that might inspire other companies to set teams up like this, so I'm going to go through a few things you shared. One is one person in charge of the team, like the founder almost. They're basically the founder of the team. They have one very senior, essentially, sponsor/decision-maker that they interface with. In your case, Elon, no big deal. In other cases, it could be the CTO, CPO, someone like that. The team is focused 100% on its product and goal. You keep the team very small, so you start with one person of each function. One front-end engineer, back-end, ML person, designer, researcher, PM, and then Google Docs is almost basically for your project management. Yeah, it's basically run with Google Docs, stop, don't use big, complicated products.

Keith Coleman (00:53:50):
I think that's a pretty good recipe. On the Google Docs, people can do what they want. If they want to use thumbnails, go for it. I think those first ingredients, really, are key structurally. Then beyond that, it's a matter of having an ambitious goal that gets-

Keith Coleman (00:54:00):
And then beyond that, it's a matter of having an ambitious goal that gets people fired up to go do great work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:06):
Yeah. Awesome. I think there's a lot there that a lot of people think they should do when they set these teams up, but they don't actually do, and it feels like each of these is just a really key ingredient to it to actually succeeding.

Keith Coleman (00:54:17):
It definitely really helped us succeed. I don't know that the project would be here if it was not for some of those elements.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:24):
That's a powerful statement. This thing that has changed the way the world understands what is true would not have existed if you didn't set it up in this specific way.

Keith Coleman (00:54:34):
Yeah. I don't know if I would've begun the project had I not known. We had that structure, that ability to make decisions, the autonomy, the speed, the ability to go fast. We started with that in 1.0 and it's been continued and if anything, furthered in X. X as a whole company operates with a lot of those attributes, and I think it's one of the reasons the product is successful. I think those are big reasons why at least, Jay can speak for himself, I have so much fun working on this. I love working on it. It's great to wake up every day and solve these problems. We get to do them efficiently, make decisions quickly, build stuff that helps a lot of people. It's awesome.

Jay Baxter (00:55:25):
This whether thermal or Elon way of operating is definitely more fun and the fact that... That combined with the awesome mission is super important for internal recruiting. I remember when I was first chatting to Keith about this back in early 2020, I had another project. I worked on a few, but one was like personalize the number of push notifications that we send, and it drove a lot of DAU without losing opt-outs significantly. So that was setting me on track, or if I had kept working on that, I could have probably gotten a promotion from that with low risk, or I could take this huge career... It's not as big at a career risk as joining or founding an actual external startup, but there is still career risk, I guess, in joining a team like this. I think all of the same aspects of recruiting that apply to external startups and apply internally, and if you can have an exciting vision, that is key.

Keith Coleman (00:56:30):
Related to that and your list, Lenny, one thing we missed that's super important is that on this project, and I think of successful projects like it in startups, is that people are self-selecting to join. We did not assign anyone to this project. People reached out to join or they applied to join the job. I and the team interviewed every single person that joined the team and we were like, "We want that person on the team. They want to be on the team." And so people are totally bought in to the goal, mission, the way the team works, the other people they're going to be working with. And that makes a huge difference.

(00:57:10):
So a great time to do that is at the start of one of these things. If you're going to try something crazy, it's going to be tough if you're just assigning random people to it. But if you let people opt in and self-select much more likely to be successful. And one thing that I have observed at X, which really surprised me was that this is also possible at a large scale. One of the things that Elon did when he bought the company was he basically asked people to self-select to stay. You had to click the button. And he sent an email out that was like, "Hey, Twitter 2.0."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:44):
Fork in the road. Right? [inaudible 00:57:46]

Keith Coleman (00:57:45):
Fork in the road. Fork in the road. Exactly. He's like, "Twitter 2.0, now X, it's going to be hardcore. We're going to do ambitious things. You're going to work your butt off." And you had to click on the form and say, "Yes, I want to join." And I think that was really important for the company because you want people to opt into that. You want the people to be saying, "Yeah, that's what I want to do," and the company's going to be a lot more successful. If people aren't sure, it's better for them probably to go do something else and where they're naturally more aligned and happier. And I thought that was a great approach to taking a large company and getting it down to people who are really excited about working together on a mission. So for us, we did it from day one, which I think is an easy way to do it, but it's possible to do it later as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):
I love that you described it as fun and I think a lot of people when they see Elon laying off a bunch of people, being very hardcore himself, people don't imagine it as a fun place to work. And it's clear how much you guys love working on this, how fun it is and how interesting it is. And it's interesting to hear that 'cause I think a lot of people don't feel that externally. Is there anything else along the lines of just working for Elon within an org Elon runs that might surprise people about just the way of working that's interesting or surprising or you think other companies might want to think about adopting?

Keith Coleman (00:59:07):
I've always liked lean teams, but my experience at X has made me change the way I would think about running a future org-... If I were to start a company and had to change the way I think about starting that company, I would be even leaner than I would've made it before. I've been amazed with just how much the team is able to accomplish with a small group. And I think because of a small group, shortly after the acquisition, we had this product called Spaces. It had been in the product before, but it was pretty small scale, and Elon wanted to run these large spaces. I forget who the first people he was going to bring on were, but he was going to be there. Ultimately, these things have gone on to host politicians and things like that, and he's like, "Guys, we got to scale this up." I forget the numbers.

(00:59:57):
He's like, "We need to be able to scale a million people," or something like that. I'm getting the numbers wrong. "You need to be able to scale way up." This is the kind of thing at 1.0 That would've taken a year if it had ever happened, and the team did it in two or three weeks. And it was really exciting and inspiring to see. I didn't work on that, but I watched it from the outside. I'm like, "Wow, with this tiny team motivated behind a big goal that was like, 'Hey, guys, it's not like, are we going to do this?' It's, 'We are going to do this.'" They got it done in two or three weeks. That must've felt amazing for them. It was certainly exciting to see. But I've definitely come to appreciate just how lean something can be and not just get by but actually thrive because it's that lean.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):
I think the point you made about people opting into that is important, 'cause I think a lot of people hearing that would be like, "I would never want to be asked to build something like that in two weeks." And I think a lot of people do, and we love that kind of experience, especially working with the Elon, especially shipping something at that scale. But I think there's an important element there of just like, "Okay, I don't want to do that. I have other things to do in my life other than ship spaces." So I think that's a key point you've raised of just there's an opt-in step.

Keith Coleman (01:01:10):
Totally. I think the opt in is important, and it may even be that you want to opt in at one point in your life, and maybe at another point in your life something else is better. I think whatever it is you're choosing to do, it's nice to be opting in to feel like it's aligned with how you want to spend your time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):
Something on my mind, and I don't know if you guys want to go here, but it's something I think a lot of people think about is when Elon came in, he let go of 80% of folks. And everyone's just like, "Twitter is dead. It's all going to fall apart. There's no way they can run this thing with that small of a staff," and clearly they were wrong. Clearly, it's working great. It's becoming a massive deal in the world and continues to grow. Is there anything about that that you were surprised by or anything about just how it continues to operate so well in spite of that big shift?

Keith Coleman (01:01:57):
I think the leaner team, the reduced process in bureaucracy is a big reason it does move as fast as it does. It's easier to get stuff done faster here. Yeah. I think that shrinking is actually a big reason for the increased pace of launches, the increased pace of experimentation. One thing that I noticed a result of that is the people who are here, they seem to all really feel like owners. They take the sense of responsibility that an owner takes in the product. They'll try to track down what's wrong, fix whatever is needed, jump in to help build or fix, improve any system that needs help, even if it's outside of their space. And there's the flip side of that too. For people who've worked at big companies, they may have experienced this thing where there's like ano-... You want to change something in some other system or product, and so you reach out to that team. And maybe they're a little resistant, they'll maybe be like, "Oh, we'll get to that next quarter or so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:07):
They have their own goals to hit. Yeah. [inaudible 01:03:08]

Keith Coleman (01:03:08):
Yeah. Exactly. They don't really necessarily want to help you or they're busy. Here, you're like, "Hey, guys, we need to do this thing with that other system you work on." And they're like, "Great! Here's the code. Here are the docs. Send us the fab if you have any questions, and we'll get it in." And it's just the thing, you can just jump in and get it done. And that kind of collaborative effort, like the sense of shared ownership, I think from my experience came from or was a result of the shrinking of the team down to people who wanted to be there and work together to build this thing. So I think that's been a really positive impact. It's not always easy. Certainly, a lot of people have a lot of responsibilities, but they're here because they're up for it.

Jay Baxter (01:03:53):
Yeah. I think one other thing that's key is when you are forced to have such a small team, well, this is important anyways, but deleting code is more important than writing it a lot of the time. So I think so often maybe due to promotion incentives or just regular human tendency, engineers have a tendency to add these little incremental wins that actually add more of a long-term maintenance cost than is clear, because you just run a little one month A-B test, you see this significant win and you don't realize the maintenance burden you just added to your team for the rest of eternity until you turn the thing off. So I think there's a lot to be gained and you get forced to do this, by the way, when you have such a small team. It's just auditing parts of your system and deleting the things where the maintenance cost is worse than the gains. So I think we did have to do this across the company after the big layoffs, and systems are leaner now and they can be worked on by fewer numbers of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):
That's an amazing point. I remember Elon's being like, "Here, we have to throw away the whole thing. We have to re-architect everything. It's stupid the way it's built." And it sounds like that actually worked.

Jay Baxter (01:05:10):
Yeah, so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:10):
Well.

Jay Baxter (01:05:11):
You don't have to rewrite everything from scratch. Some things are good, I guess, to rewrite. But just even deleting the unnecessary cruft and keeping the rest of the core system, that's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:23):
I love that we're creating a formula to run these sorts of companies and teams. There's so much here. I want to go back to the building of the original product. I took us on a long tangent and an amazing tangent, but I heard a story of when you launched Birdwatch at that point. You specifically wanted to keep expectations very low and there was a GIF in the thing, and it just looked like clearly this is not ready for prime time. Talk about just how you did that, how you launched it in a way where people weren't like, "It's never going to work."

Keith Coleman (01:05:53):
We were very disciplined, I guess you could say, about having the product prove itself at every given point. When we built the first mockups, these were just pictures of depicting what community notes might look like. We showed those to people across the political spectrum. We saw, hey, people really like these. Whether they're on the right or left, they seem very open to reading these community notes even when they're critical to people of their own side. So we're like, "All right. That gives us confidence that if we can build this, if we can actually make this as a reality, it's going to work." Then there's a question of can we make it a reality? Will people in the real world be able to write notes that are of this quality?

(01:06:35):
And so we had an internal pilot test version of this where you could write notes. And we first basically ran this through an Amazon MTurk type of participant test just to see if you just put some normal people in there, will they be able to write these notes? All those notes weren't good, but it was clear that there were people out there who could write good notes. So then like, "Okay, this is possible. What will happen if we actually do this out in the real world? And let's run a pilot and find out." And so we took that pilot that we'd run the MTurk of test on, and we released it to at first 1000 people, totally out in public, and we didn't know what was going to show up. You could imagine the notes could have been terrible.

(01:07:27):
And so we were talking, "Well, what do we do? We're going to put this out there. Everyone's going to have all these questions. They're probably going to be really skeptical, and we know it might be a total dumpster fire. And so what do we do to set expectations appropriately?" We felt like we could probably get there in the end, but we just didn't know what was going to happen at first. We wanted to set expectations, and so we're like, "Well, why don't we just stick..." There's the page where you see a post in the notes below. We're like, "Why don't we just stick a dumpster fire GIF on that page?" And you go there, you're like, "Hey, anything you see below here might just be a total dumpster fire. At least it would show we were aware of that as a possible risk." In the end, we did not do that. It cracked me up, but we thought it was like-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):
Oh, you didn't actually launch. Okay. That was just a concept. Okay.

Keith Coleman (01:08:16):
We had mockups of it, and every time I looked at the mockup, I laughed, but ultimately we had so much to explain on that page, like, what is this thing and how does it work? Ultimately, we're like, "Okay, this is probably going to distract from the point." So we pulled it. I wish maybe it had seen the light of day at one point, but yeah, ultimately we kept it simple and we focused that page on explaining what was going on here. But again, as has happened many times with the project, we put the pilot out there and the notes were good.

(01:08:48):
They weren't all good. It was a mixed bag, but there was gold in there. And from the very early days with just 1000 contributors, it was obvious that people could write notes that were informative, that were neutral, that spoke to controversial challenging topics, and that if we could just identify those from the rest, this was going to work. It was going to work as well as the very first mockups we had made. So that became the focus that is, how do we sift out the gold from the rest?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
I think you may have shared with this with me, when someone noticed you guys were testing this and they took screenshots and tweeted it, and I think Elon replied, "This is cool."

Keith Coleman (01:09:27):
Yeah. Yeah. So in the very early days when it was just a Figma prototype, we were running these usertesting.com on moderated studies. I guess one of the participants sent one to an NBC reporter who wrote a bunch of stories on it. Anyway, that day, there was a lot of chatter about it on the service, and Elon... To put this back in time perspective, this is, I think, 2020, so two years before any acquisition stuff happened, Elon is just a Twitter user building rockets and electric cars and other cool stuff and stumbles on this thing that depicts the prototype that we've been testing. And he writes back, "Definitely worth trying, IMO." And I remember thinking that was cool back then and it's interesting to see, he's obviously had a very consistent point on it. I think the idea was appealing and he has obviously been a big fan of it in the product and had been a big supporter proponent. So yeah, it was cool that it came from... that support has been from the very early days before he was ever involved in the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
I love that moment. That must have felt really wild for Elon to be commenting on this Figma prototype retesting.

Keith Coleman (01:10:42):
It was cool. It was cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:44):
Oh, man. So when we were preparing for this interview, I asked you guys what's the main thing you want to make sure people get and understand about why community notes has been so effective? And Keith, you specifically said that it was the principles behind how you wanted to approach this and how you continue to stick to this throughout. And we'll talk about how you kept it alive throughout all these different CO changes in leaders. But just talk about these principles, what the actual principles are and why that was so key to it working out.

Keith Coleman (01:11:16):
There are a number of principles that I think when we first shared them with people at the company seemed maybe a little bit crazy. But I think they are the reason the product works, and I think they've been very important, and we do. We come back to them regularly, today, all the time. Probably the craziest one is just that this thing is going to be the voice of the people. It's going to represent the voice of people. It's not going to represent the company's voice. So it is not a tech company deciding what shows. It is the people deciding what shows, and that had a lot of implications on the design. First of all, we don't have a button that will change the status of a note. So if a note is showing because the people have rated it and found it helpful, it is going to show. We can't change that.

(01:12:08):
And that is the kind of thing that when we first propose this, that's unsettling to people. They're like, "Wait, so something can go up and the company can't take it down, or can't change its status, get it to stop showing." And we're like, "Yeah, and it has to work that well. If it doesn't work well enough to do that, then it doesn't work." This is one of our key principles was, if there's a problem with a note that's so bad, you want to do something about it's a problem with the system. We need to redesign the system to be showing good notes. And so yeah, we had to get everyone comfortable with the idea that there was no button to change the status of a note. Similarly, as we talked about earlier, we wanted this to represent all of humanity.

(01:12:53):
And so we didn't want to be arbiters of who can come in and be a contributor and who can't. So we open it to everyone. You just have to meet a really basic objective criteria. You have to have a verified phone to help reduce the likelihood of having bots or things like that participating. But beyond that, it's random selection and it still is that way today. And again, that people took some time to get people comfortable with it. But I think that the fact that this is the voice of the people and reflects their output through an open and transparent process is so key to both why it is good, why it works, but also why it's trusted. So that's number one and I think will forever be the heart of the product. Another one that people thought was crazy was transparency.

(01:13:49):
The previous approaches to dealing with misleading info, it felt to a lot of people, like black box tech companies or media companies or leads or whatever making decisions. We're like, "People need to get comfortable with this. They need to trust this. So the whole thing has to be out in the open." The code that decides what notes share has to be out in the open. All of the data and ratings that make it happen have to be out in the open. People should be able to take the code and data and replicate the whole service and that we have done exactly what we've said we've done. And they should be able to audit it. They should be able to go and look and say, "Hey, I think this part could be better."

(01:14:28):
Or if they think we're biased, they should be able to work with the data and point it out. And if people have good observations, that should factor back into the code. And this is, again, something that's difficult to get people comfortable with, that everything is out there, you can't cover anything up. But I think that's so essential to people trusting it. Yeah, we set these out on day one. We go back to them constantly because we're always evolving the product, and we're always like got to make sure every new change is open. Whenever we update the scoring system, there's an update in GitHub when the data is published daily so you can download it. And so yeah, I think those have been really essential to the thing working.

Jay Baxter (01:15:13):
And by the way, these do not come without a cost. It's actually really hard from an end perspective to actually open source the actual algorithm that's running on the actual data. Because the way large-scale services like this are usually architected does not naturally lend itself to being run as a script by someone who's downloaded a TSV. So we actually have to take weird architectural decisions to make this possible in a way that probably wouldn't have been if we didn't start with this assumption from scratch. We would've had to maybe rewrite the system to make it like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:49):
What's an example of that?

Jay Baxter (01:15:50):
For instance, there's a matrix factorization that we train. Usually, you would train a matrix factor... train your ML model once and then serve it, I guess with a separate service. But we didn't want to have people externally spinning up services to be able to replicate the system that we had. So basically, I don't think it would've been actually very cool if we had open sourced the code in a way that wasn't actually runnable, I guess, by someone just... At this point, you can download Python code and run a script. You do need a lot of RAM right now, but you can do it on one machine.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
Okay. How much RAM are we talking about?

Jay Baxter (01:16:37):
Oh, only like 500 gigs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):
Okay. Okay. That's reasonable.

Jay Baxter (01:16:41):
It'll take a day if you don't do anything special to speed it up. Good to know, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:45):
Cool.

Jay Baxter (01:16:46):
Possible is the key thing, and people have done it. Vitalik Buterin had a blog post where he talks about his explorations, making sure the algorithm really does what it says it does. And I think just the fact that a handful of people have done this, there's enough people who have done it that there's someone you'd probably trust who's verified it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
And that's rolling out to Meta. No big deal. I love just as you described these principles, just I could imagine a PM at a company being like, "Okay, guys. Here, I want to do this project." There's so much idealism to it that rarely works in real life; going to be open source. You're going to give it to everyone. We don't have actual control over what it's going to do, don't worry about it. It's going to just change the way people see this thing that we've been very careful about and then it works. And I think that's very rare and it's really impressive. And what I'm hearing partly is that sticking to those principles was actually really fundamental to it working and not bending over when someone's like, "No, no, no, we can't do this. What if we change this part?"

Keith Coleman (01:17:54):
I think if we had broken with any of those principles, if there was anything black box, if there was whatever, the product would be a lot harder to trust. And so I think it's because we've just stuck to them so cleanly simply that people can trust it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:11):
You've talked about a few moments when it was like, wow, the White House changed their announcement because of the community note. We talked about the dog is a cat. Are there any other moments that after you launched of, "Holy shit, this is working? This is going to actually work."

Keith Coleman (01:18:26):
All along, we saw it working. We wanted to be confident whenever we expanded it to new audiences or new countries or whatever, we wanted to be confident it was going to work. So maybe held our breath a little bit just to see that it would do what we expected, but we always expected that. But that said, there were definitely stress cases. The one that comes to mind is the start of the Israel Hamas conflict in 2023 in October. That was probably the largest deluge of misleading information I've ever seen shared on the internet at one time. It was overwhelming. A number of photos and videos and whatever coming out related to that, it was insane. And just to give you an example, I think it was first three days or something of that conflict, we had 500 notes covering all sorts of different... out of context imagery.

(01:19:32):
Someone would say, "Hey, this is happening here." It's actually from 2013 in Syria. There were people making fake battle footage in the video game simulator Arma 3. So there were notes explaining, this stuff looked realistic. And unless you saw the note, you wouldn't really know. There are all sorts of claims about what was going on in the ground, and that was definitely... The product was still pretty new at that point. We'd expanded in the U. S. less than a year before that. We had been rolling out throughout the world that year and then this large event happened. And I felt like we were just enough prepared at the right time for the system to be able to handle that.

(01:20:16):
Probably one of the most important things we did right before that was launch the ability to write notes on images and videos and have those matched to other posts. I remember at that time thinking, "Wow, I'm glad we launched that feature a few months ago versus still had it on the shelf," because it was really important in that conflict. And I think even it was just a few weeks before we had launched a major speed up in notes too. When we first built the product, the number one focus was always quality. We knew that the product would live and die by the quality of the notes. That was the thing we could never give up on. We also knew it needed to deliver speed and scale, but we're like, "We will get the quality in the right place, and we can speed it up and scale-

Keith Coleman (01:21:00):
Get the quality in the right place and we can speed it up and scale it out over time. And we had actually just launched a speed-up that took three hours off the time it needed to go live, and it was I think a matter of weeks before that conflict happened, so again, super glad that was out there. In the first few days of the conflict the median time from a post going live to a note showing up was five hours, which is like crazy fast. Typical fact checking is like two to four, at least it's really common to see it take two to four days. These notes were showing up in five hours and we're like, we are so glad we got those things out before this happened, it made the service a lot more helpful.

Jay Baxter (01:21:40):
One other thing that was, I think, nice to see working then was, one criticism of Community Notes some people bring up is, well if you always need agreement from people who typically disagree, then in these super polarized settings, that conflict being probably number one, then you wouldn't see any notes. But actually the reality was there were tons of notes about that conflict. So I think there was this kind of nice property where actually, and maybe this is a surprising fact, that there's more agreement out there across polarized divides than maybe conventional wisdom says, and the places where people agreed were really objectively true and verifiable. I guess maybe this is more true the more polarized the setting is, but where the agreement actually lends you, and basically notes that are very neutrally written, very focused on the facts and easy to verify information.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):
There's this talk for a while of just there's no more facts, nobody believes there is a single true fact anymore, everything is subjective, and I think Community Notes proves the opposite. Facts matter, there are facts that we can all agree with even on the most controversial topics.

Keith Coleman (01:23:04):
Yeah, we saw this really from day one, when we would show those prototypes to people just depicting the idea, it was really obvious that people cared more about, or they cared a lot about understanding reality and what was going on and they were willing to disagree with their side, so to speak, to recognize that. And I think that's not always that obvious to people. The world does feel really polarized, but people definitely are willing to cross partisan boundaries to get to accurate information and that's why the product works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):
It feels like as we rely more and more on what we know and understand about the world is becoming social media online and moving this quickly, it's like I'm so thankful this exists because otherwise it'd just be, what do we trust anymore? This being out aligns with we need this thing to exist at the same time. And it feels like at the same time there's also people I just don't trust. I think people have shifted from I trust what I read to, okay, I shouldn't just believe everything I'm reading. Is there anything there you're noticing about just how people think about news they see and their shift of just like, I'm not going to believe everything. Is there anything that you've noticed about just human behavior or just the way we've shifted understanding what is true?

Keith Coleman (01:24:30):
We haven't done any research to look broadly at how people's perceptions are changing there, but I certainly have found myself that particularly seeing notes, I am more skeptical about what I read at first, and I think that's been helpful. And we hear that from people, that they think about things a bit more, and I think that's a good secondary effect and benefit of something like this, which is the more you see the patterns of how what you're reading can be wrong, the more you can thoughtfully question it and try to get a better understanding of what's really going on. So historically I think this was called media literacy, but basic idea of can you understand the ways in which things can go wrong and try to cut them yourself.

Jay Baxter (01:25:21):
Another aspect I think we help with that is discovery of the Community Notes. I think often before Community Notes you could have just been living in a little news filter bubble, or maybe there were fact checks out there that you should have been reading but you weren't discovering them. So the fact that the note applies, it is directly attached to the post and visible by anyone who sees the post helps cross those filter bubbles and can kind of... I think for some people it's the first time they've actually seen counter arguments to claims made in their own little echo chamber.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:59):
That's incredible, yeah. I love the point you're making about how it actually teaches people to be a little more skeptical of the things they read. It's an education system more than just, here, this one thing is wrong. I love that.

(01:26:13):
Okay, just a few more questions. There was an audience question asked on Twitter, we all asked on Twitter, "What do people want to know about Community Notes?" one was actually why you guys switched to anonymous contributors, what was the decision behind that?

Keith Coleman (01:26:26):
Yeah, we had this pilot where we were testing with a small number of contributors, a few thousand contributors, and we learned a lot through that pilot. Probably the biggest thing we learned was related to anonymity or pseudonymity of contributors. We had originally assumed that it was important that people contribute under their real handle, or their real name, or whatever it was. The first prototypes depicted that, we kind of thought that would be important for people trusting the note, and actually it was totally wrong. The best option was actually opposite of what we first tried.

(01:27:02):
We found a few things. One, people were hesitant to write a note on a controversial topic because they didn't want to get attacked or harassed online. And so some people were comfortable doing this but others were not, and so it meant there was more potential good notes to be written than were getting written, and this was very clear feedback from the pilot.

(01:27:24):
Two, and this is super interesting, people are actually more willing to cross partisan boundaries when they are anonymous or pseudonymous than when they are under their real name, and it intuitively makes a lot of sense. If you publicly are using your name, you feel are affiliated with one side versus the other, you might hesitate to be perceived as breaking with that side. But you may actually, for example, find a note helpful that's critical of that side, and there's a bunch of studies that show when people are anonymous, they're much more willing to cross partisan boundaries and work with the other side, agree with the other side, and we saw that too. And so by allowing people to be pseudonymous, you actually get more honest answers about what they really think and it helps find disagreement that really-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:11):
That's so counterintuitive.

Keith Coleman (01:28:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:12):
You never hear the opposite always, and it's so interesting it's the opposite.

Keith Coleman (01:28:15):
Yeah, yeah.

Jay Baxter (01:28:17):
I think the same principle applies to making the likes private.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:21):
I was just thinking that.

Jay Baxter (01:28:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:23):
Yeah, I like a lot more stuff that's a little, definitely, I wouldn't have liked, yeah.

Keith Coleman (01:28:28):
It allows freedom for honesty, which is pretty great. And one of the criticisms of pseudonymity is it can generate, maybe people have reached the quality threshold that they put out there, but we have so many quality mechanisms in the system that that wasn't an issue, so we could keep quality high while opening up for that honesty.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:48):
Another question, you touched on this a little bit, which is around navigating the existing trust and safety apparatus of Twitter, which as you described, basically, previously, it was like we make decisions on what is true and not, and every company works this way, you guys basically upended that like, here's a completely different way, you have no control over what we say is true or not. Talk about just that experience of overcoming that, I imagine, very difficult hurdle of like, okay, forget all that, we're going to do it totally different.

Keith Coleman (01:29:20):
Yeah, it was definitely, what we were proposing was very different. I will say that I think people were sort of open-minded to it, generally speaking, and I think everyone had a sense that what was being done at the time wasn't really working that well or solving the problem, and people were open to new ideas, so that's a good foundation.

(01:29:39):
But I think one thing we did that was probably very helpful in that is we wanted the product to prove itself at any point. First it had to prove that people could possibly find notes helpful, then it had to prove that people could possibly write these notes that would be good quality. And so anytime that we were proposing doing something with the product, like running some research test, or running the pilot, or expanding the pilot, we always had the data that had convinced us that that was a good decision, like we were stepping into the next phase of expansion that made sense. And so I think we probably rarely proposed anything that seemed unwise, because we were holding such a high bar for quality ourselves, and I suspect that went a long way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:33):
So it's partly, what I'm hearing is, take it step by step to prove this is actually working, and partly be confident it is working to yourself before you try to convince the trust and safety team this is the way to go.

Keith Coleman (01:30:46):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:49):
Was there a moment along that journey it shifted from no way this is a thing to okay, wow, let's actually consider this? Or was it this very gradual process?

Keith Coleman (01:30:59):
Whether other people were saying no way to wow, let's actually-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Yeah, just internally of just like, okay, we're going to actually stop this trust and safety way of operating and instead rely on Community Notes, was there a moment of like, okay, let's actually make that switch, or was that Elon actually, is that the big switch?

Keith Coleman (01:31:15):
The biggest change there happened in X, the biggest changes prior to that were just the decision to put this out there and have it be operating in public at first US wide scale. But yeah, then the bigger switches came in the X period.

Jay Baxter (01:31:36):
I think even though there was original research before Birdwatch had even started, or Community Notes had even started, from external researchers showing that crowdsourced fact-checkers, laypeople can do about as well as fact-checkers and actually the agreement rates were kind of similar between the groups. I think even though that research was out there, I think there were definitely a lot of people who didn't really believe it could work until it already worked.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:04):
Basically prove it, prove that it works. Yeah, that makes sense, versus just a bunch of docs and strategy and thinking, it's just like, look, it's actually working, you can see for yourself.

Jay Baxter (01:32:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:14):
Makes sense. Okay, possibly last question, we'll see which fractals of questions you guys bring up here. I referenced this a couple times, this incredible achievement of keeping a project alive through Jack and then, I have this note, and Kayvon running the show then, and then Parag running Twitter, and then Elon, and then Linda taking over as CEO, quite rare, especially something this visible, this impactful to everything that X is. Any lessons or keys to that actually working, of this project surviving throughout so many work changes and leaders?

Keith Coleman (01:32:54):
It definitely has been a crazy time to be building something. It's been fun. The craziness has been entertaining. I think one reason perhaps the product has done so well and survived is the nature of the product itself. It is designed to produce information that is found helpful by people who normally disagree. And so even if you have CEOs or leaders who might disagree, there's a good chance actually they'll find it helpful, they'll be like, wow, this thing does produce pretty useful output. So I think there's something in the nature of the product itself, that when people see it, whatever side they're on, left, up, down, they're likely to find it pretty helpful, so I do think that helps.

(01:33:39):
I also think the team executed really well. We had ambitious goals that were exciting, they solved a real problem. This is a real problem that matters in the world. At every step, as we talked about, the product needed to prove itself, and we would make sure it proved itself and we would bring the results that convinced us and we'd share those with people. And so they would say, oh yeah, I agree, it kind of proved itself, let's take the next leap. And we've done that all along the way and we continue to operate that way, and I think that focus on the outcome and goal that matters, and executing against it, really helped.

(01:34:24):
The team did not get distracted by much all through the period during which the acquisition happened. There was a lot of opportunity for distraction. This team was shipping every week, we were super focused on the goal, let's make this thing work, let's get these notes out there, and I think people saw that execution and were excited to support it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:49):
Yeah, like it's working, why would we mess with that? And it's important, and it keeps us from having to hire tens of thousands of people to fact check.

Keith Coleman (01:34:57):
The interesting thing about that is no one ever asked us or brought up or seemed to care about anything related to cost savings in this process. And I think that's an assumption people have outside the company, that this must have been a reason there was interest in it. But that was never a goal, it was not at all why the project was started, it was not why people were excited about the project. And I think that's also, for people outside who maybe don't see the conversations, it's kind of a heartening thing to know, is that the focus was always on solving the problem. The other approach is even if you had 10,000 people doing it, the real issue is that they don't work that well because they're not trusted or they don't scale or they're too slow. And so the goal was really always just help people stay informed at scale. Let's build an internet scale solution to an internet scale problem that people like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:51):
Something I heard about you, Keith, when I was asking people about how this worked and why this worked so well is that they describe you with having a very low ego, and that allowed you to give up this whole team and power and influence and just the name, forget it, whatever you want, we'll call it Community Notes, great. Is there anything in there you can share of just how you think about that and how important that is as a product leader to have a low ego?

Keith Coleman (01:36:19):
For me, this project, I feel like I get to do community service with this project. I see my work as in service of the people and the community, and that's what motivates me. The only thing that I care about is delivering the outcome that the world finds helpful. And so in some ways the project has not been about ego, it's about truth-seeking, let's find... Not truth in the sense of what information is true, but let's find out what's actually going to make this work. How does it need to be structured, what should it be called? Whatever is going to produce the best outcome is what we should do. So I think I feel more attached to the product being helpful than to anything else, and so to whatever degree it might seem like low ego is probably more a result of wanting to actually solve the problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:15):
And I think partly what I'm hearing is just if you win and succeed, good things will happen, so focus on that.

Keith Coleman (01:37:20):
Certainly satisfying things will happen, it's very satisfying to have people appreciate it. It's satisfying that people on the left and right love it. It's satisfying that even people who receive notes, love notes, and reach out to them and post them, that's amazing, it feels so good to have helped give people that, and yeah, it's very motivating. It's a great reason to wake up in the morning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:44):
It's absurd this has worked, but it's also like of course this would work, of course something like this should work. It's like such interesting-

Keith Coleman (01:37:50):
It's the internet, it's of the internet, that's why it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:55):
Oh man. Where's Community Notes going from here? What's happening, where's it going, what's the future?

Keith Coleman (01:38:03):
We're always working on basically more better notes faster. So there's clearly an opportunity to get more notes out there, we want them to stay as good or better than they are, we want to get them there faster, so we're always working on core product changes to help deliver that. Recently, for example, we just released an update to what we call the Community Notes bat signal, or the ability to request a Community Note. So anyone on X can say, "Hey, I think this post needs a Community Note," and now they can even add a source explaining why so that when a prospective writer sees that it's much easier for them to write a note. So we're always working on core things like that, core algorithm improvements.

(01:38:47):
I think there are also new frontiers that show a lot of potential, AI and LLMs are one. It's easy to imagine a lot of ways that AI could assist the people in this task they're doing of trying to get information out there quickly. And maybe Jay should talk about the Supernotes work that we've done with some folks outside the company.

Jay Baxter (01:39:13):
Yeah, so one cool thing about having public data and code is that external researchers can collaborate with you, and in this case Supernotes had this idea that we can basically take existing notes as input, existing proposed notes that maybe they have some problem, maybe they have part of the story, maybe they're worded in kind of a biased way. Basically take all these in, have an LLM generate a ton of different variants, and then basically make the simulated jury to basically get a representative group of contributors for community notes who would be rating the note and try to predict based on their past ratings how they would rate these LLM generated notes. And so this way you can actually, rather than just having an LLM write a note from scratch and hoping it's good, you can simulate the entire community notes rating process and explicitly create notes that are likely to be rated helpful by people.

(01:40:18):
So I think ideas like that are very promising for the future, and it's a nice way that LLMs and humans can work together. Obviously agents can browse the web too, and that's one way that you could imagine agents assisting humans is maybe checking whether a note is actually supported by the source. Although then you get into things like, well, are people going to actually be as diligent? Right now I think raters are very diligent because they know just some Community Notes contributor wrote this like, I better check this before I rate it helpful. But hopefully we can design things in a way such that people don't trust the output and actually verify it themselves before issuing a helpful rating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):
Yeah, that is such an interesting area to explore where you want to avoid AI hallucinating slop versus make it easier and scale it even further. What an interesting challenge.

Keith Coleman (01:41:23):
What's cool about this project, in addition to the AI element, is that it's being done outside the company. We talked earlier about the open source transparency. The key reason we made this all open source was so people could see how it worked, but the dream is actually that, it's not just that the contributions to the notes and ratings are from the people, but the dream is actually the product is built by the people. What if the scoring algorithm were significantly or entirely written by the public? That would be incredible. And Supernotes is probably the first very substantial potential change in the algorithm of the way it works, that was kind of coming from the outside and plausibly could be part of the core, so we'd love to see the product go in that direction as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:08):
Sweet, go Supernotes. Well guys, the work you're doing is tremendous. This is every product person's dream, I think to work, on something like this. Small team, lots of support, lots of impact, just innately interesting, and so I think this is going to inspire a lot of people.

(01:42:27):
So let me just ask you, is there anything else you wanted to share? Anything else you think might be helpful for folks to leave them with?

Jay Baxter (01:42:33):
Sure, I guess one thing that just I thought was interesting over the course of working on this product is just there's... I think in a similar way to how retweets originally were not something Jack came up with, I think users just started doing it and then it became a core part of the product. There's a huge way already in which there's just a lot of surprising things that people wanted to use Community Notes for that I don't think we really expected, and it's kind of cool to see those user desires emerge.

(01:43:04):
I think one example, I guess we had always been imagining political type of misinformation, but for whatever reason there's a lot of people who love debating whether Messi or Ronaldo got more goals. I guess it's kind of a funny one. There's a community moderation aspect, so I think we also thought that this would be specifically for adding context to misleading or potentially misleading information, but what you can see is that there are some notes that go beyond that towards calling out content that they think is spammy or something. So I think that's just another dimension in which commuted notes is a product that's driven by the people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:57):
That's so beautiful, basically they're trying to keep Twitter/X healthy and they're just like, no, this should be taken down, this tweet of spam.

Jay Baxter (01:44:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:06):
I love that. Is there an answer on the Messi versus, who is the other soccer player?

Jay Baxter (01:44:10):
Ronaldo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:11):
Ronaldo, okay. Is there a definitive fact there or is that just unknowable?

Jay Baxter (01:44:17):
Yeah, I guess that's an interesting one because it's a case where raters are actually very polarized. I guess it actually kind of fits into the core algorithm where there's some people who are just diehard Messi fans or Ronaldo fans, just like they could be on politics, so we actually specifically modeled that topic, as well as some other topics, so we can estimate people's opinion on that particular debate. It's kind of funny that something like that would emerge.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:45):
You're saying that's the most controversial topic on X, Ronaldo versus Messi.

Jay Baxter (01:44:51):
That's a controversial one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:52):
Oh wow, who knew? Okay. Keith, is there anything you wanted to add?

Keith Coleman (01:44:58):
Yeah, community Notes is cool itself, but I think what it points to about society is actually even bigger. Society often feels really polarized, you hear people talk about it all the time, no one can ever agree on anything, but actually Community Note shows you people really can agree on quite a lot. Even on super controversial topics related to politics and everything, there's a lot of agreement, that's why notes work.

(01:45:23):
And I think that's a really big reason for optimism about the world, is that while it might feel polarized, there's probably like an 80% set of people that agree on quite a lot of things. And imagine if we could use the same kind of approaches we use with notes, but to find agreement on legislation, or policies, or things like that that people want the government or the world to do, possibly we could get a lot more momentum behind these ideas that the people really want and everyone would be a lot happier. Maybe 10% of the people on the edges wouldn't be happy, but I bet there's a lot of agreement that we are not identifying, and if we did it, we'd all be pretty happy. So I don't know, I think it's easy for people to feel pessimistic about the world, but I think this product is a good reason to be optimistic about the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:12):
What an incredible way to end it. I can also see, Keith, why people want to join you and work with you and work on this team.

Keith Coleman (01:46:19):
Appreciate it. If you do want to join, we are hiring an ML engineer. You get to work on these amazing problems with us and have a lot of fun, so we're accepting applications at x.com/communitynotes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:32):
Okay, great, I'm glad you gave the URL. Oh man, you're about to get flooded.

(01:46:36):
Guys, thank you so much for doing this. Is there anywhere other than that place to go off, join the team as an ML engineer, is there any other place you want to point people to, either your socials or anything else?

Keith Coleman (01:46:47):
I'm KeithColeman on X, please reach out if you have any feedback or want to help us out, whether you may want to work here or want to do something from the outside, we would love to talk.

Jay Baxter (01:46:58):
Yeah, I'm @ _JayBaxter_ at X. Yeah, I think in particular, besides just using Community Notes, it would be great to get more substantial contributions, pull requests, collaborate on projects like Supernotes, I think that's the most exciting type of stuff if people do want to contribute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:22):
Ship some code guys. Amazing. Guys, thank you so much for doing this.

Keith Coleman (01:47:27):
Thanks for having us, Lenny.

## Transcript

Ken Norton (00:00:00):
Part of what I think is pretty exciting about product management is you are a leader from day one in product management. There's leadership all over the place, but that's your job. You're a leader. You don't have any formal authority, but you're a leader. You're expected to lead

Lenny (00:00:22):
Over his 14-year career at Google. Ken Norton led product teams at built Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Maps, and even did a stint at Google Ventures. The products that he's helped craft are now used by over three billion people.

(00:00:37):
Today Ken is a full-time executive coach specializing at working with product leaders. In our conversation, we cover the creative versus reactive mindset, why the art of product management is much more important than the science of product management, how to get over imposter syndrome, the most common PM blind spots, how to find a coach and how to know if a coach is right for you, and so much more. I hope that you enjoy this episode with Ken Norton.

Welcome to the podcast, Ken. I am so honored to have you here. You're such a legend of product managers and product management circles. Your writing has had so much influence on so many people, including myself. If nothing else, you've led to many donuts being purchased by tech companies over the years. So thanks for being here.

Ken Norton (00:02:58):
Thank you and thanks for having me. The feeling's mutual. Obviously a big fan of your work and all the things you've done for the community and this podcast, which has been fantastic. So humbled and excited to be here. Yes, I do think that I'm at least maybe partially responsible for at least a lot of consumption of donuts over these years.

Lenny (00:03:18):
Are you tired of people asking you about donuts?

Ken Norton (00:03:21):
I'll never get tired of it. Well, back when we met with people in person, people would bring me donuts, and I never got tired of it, nor did any of the people that I worked with who got to eat those donuts get tired of it. So, no, no, I'll never get tired of donuts.

Lenny (00:03:37):
Someone on Twitter asked what's a digital equivalent of bringing the donuts now that we're in a remote world. Do you have any advice on that?

Ken Norton (00:03:45):
That's a great question. I'm not even sure if the physical equivalent of donuts is donuts. I mean when I came up with that, I think it was really to be a metaphor around being a servant leader, bringing whatever needs to be done, filling the white space, filling the gaps, whatever needed to happen. So it doesn't always have to be donuts.

(00:04:07):
I did put that question out to some of the readers in my newsletter a while ago, maybe earlier in the pandemic, and got a lot of really interesting ideas. Maybe that was at a place where people had a little bit more patience for happy hours over Zoom and stuff like that. Maybe that patient set is worn out. The idea that I love the most was actual donuts. There was a PM who got DoorDash codes and found the best local donut place for each of the people on the team and basically sent them a code and said, "Click here and order the donuts to come to your house whenever you want them." So maybe at least partially the digital equivalent of donuts might be actual donuts.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Decentralized donuts.

Ken Norton (00:04:42):
Decentralized donuts, on the blockchain.

Lenny (00:04:46):
Oh boy, let's not go there.

Ken Norton (00:04:48):
I don't know what that is.

Lenny (00:04:50):
So I was perusing your career path ahead of this chat. You had this pretty wild career. You were an engineer initially, and then you were CTO at a part of NBC. Then you're a founder. Then you spent 14 years at Google working on products that folks may have heard of, like Google Docs and Google Calendar and Google Maps. You've also done a bunch of writing. Then more recently, you've become a full-time executive coach focusing on product people.

(00:05:17):
I have so many questions I'd love to ask you about your career and learnings along the way, and the writing. But I'd actually like to spend most of our time talking about the coaching and things that you've learned through that experience. And so, I have a couple questions just off the bat. What does an executive coach actually do? What kinds of things are you helping people with? What does a session look like? Then, two, just how did you decide you wanted to be a coach full time after leaving Google?

Ken Norton (00:05:40):
Yeah, that's a great question. I think coaching does mean a lot of different things. I mean it depends on who you talk to. It is a little bit of who you are, your style, your approach. Some people are calling themselves coaches, doing more mentoring, more advice. Other people are maybe more like me, more peer coaching.

(00:06:01):
To me, I see executive coaching as a partnership or creative partnership. It's all about helping my client reach their goals, their potential, whatever that means to them. So an important thing about coaching is the definition of success does belong to the client. I don't have an agenda. I don't have a set of things I'm trying to share, teach, learn. It really is fundamentally up to them, which means every client is completely different. They have different sense of where they want to go. Different barriers that might be standing in their way.

(00:06:35):
My coaching practice, I coach the whole person. So there is no restriction on what we might talk on, what we might work on together. It's not limited to product. It's not even limited to work or even leadership. It's wherever they want to go, whatever change, transformation means to them.

(00:06:52):
As coaches, we bring a bunch of tools to the conversation. The most important ones, honestly, are probably listening and curiosity, intuition, open-mindedness, really there to help challenge them to see things in different ways, help them tap into their imagination, figure out when there might be underlying beliefs, help them connect dots that need to be connected, help them disconnect things that feel connected. There's a lot of exploration to it.

(00:07:20):
It's very jazz-like. My love of jazz has been shared before, but there is an improvisation to it. What coaching is really powerful is you may not necessarily know where you're going when you start and you follow wherever there is meaning and change for that individual, wherever is they want to go.

(00:07:38):
The question around what brought me into it was actually interesting. I, honestly working with my own executive coach, started to figure out what it is that mattered to me, what I liked, what my values were, what my purpose was, started to unpack that I love deeply connecting with people and I love helping people change and grow.

(00:08:01):
The moments when I had the opportunity to do that as a manager, as a product leader were the most fulfilling parts of my career. And so, I started to unpack that and figure out what would it look like if that was what I did.

(00:08:15):
The other part of the journey was, for several years at Google, I worked at GV. It's Google Ventures, Google's venture capital arm. I had the opportunity to work with founders and product leaders in the portfolio. I started to simultaneously recognize the shortcomings of giving advice, because it seemed like, well, I can meet with these folks, I could tell them what I did, I could tell them what Google did, and that'll answer all their questions.

(00:08:41):
You start to realize advice is not as powerful as you might think it is. It's a little bit like cotton candy. Doesn't have a lot of nutrition. You get a nice sugar high. You feel great, both sides feel happy, but then a couple weeks later, a couple months later, nothing's really changed.

(00:08:57):
That's because it doesn't often confront the real problem. It often isn't relevant. Like what worked for us at Google may not have worked anywhere else. It may not even have worked at Google for all I know. I feel like there were years at Google where all we were doing was making things worse by showing up and we should just all have gone sat on a beach somewhere, and the company would've grown even faster. So who knows?

(00:09:20):
I mean so it was these just twin pillars of wanting to figure out where I could do what I like the most, and then also recognizing that where growth comes from is less around advice and telling people what to do and more about helping them figure out their own path, their own way. Then that ultimately you brought me into, hey, I want to do this full time, and that's what I've been doing ever since.

Lenny (00:09:46):
When do you find people come to you to get advice and coaching? What kind of clients do you find you end up working with?

Ken Norton (00:09:53):
That's a great question. Generally speaking, I work with senior product leaders, however you want to define that. Typically, these are chief product officers, VPs of product at startups, largely director level and above at bigger tech companies, some CEOs, other C-level execs in there. I think really anyone that considers themselves in a product leadership role.

(00:10:15):
Often they come to me because there's a career milestone or a crossroads, and it could be that they now find themselves in the position of being a CPO for the first time. Maybe there's a new industry change, or they've gone from a big company to a startup and a have this sense of what got me here isn't going to get me there. That's oftentimes when they reach out for coaching.

(00:10:41):
I think my clients are also very introspective and surrounded by great mentors and advisors and have all sorts of people in their life who can help them, but are realizing that a lot of the work is going to be internal work that's going to get them to the next level. And so, this transformation is going to be just as much what I need to do as who I am. That's often when people come to me.

Lenny (00:11:08):
You said that the way you coach is about the whole person. I'm curious ... I don't know if there's an answer to this, but when people come to get help and coaching, how much of their blocks, I guess, are rooted in their regular life versus skills, technical skills, and more like the PME, product leadership side, if that makes sense?

Ken Norton (00:11:31):
Yeah, I think ... Well, let me maybe try to illustrate this with an example from my life right now. Indulge me, I'm going to go a little bit left field here, but I promise [inaudible 00:11:45].

Lenny (00:11:45):
Let's do it.

Ken Norton (00:11:46):
So we are teaching our 16-year-old son how to drive. So he just got his driver's permit. Do you remember when you learned how to drive, Lenny?

Lenny (00:11:56):
I do. Yup.

Ken Norton (00:11:58):
Yeah. Yeah. So it's scary. I don't know if you know how your parents might have felt, but-

Lenny (00:12:04):
Nope, [inaudible 00:12:06].

Ken Norton (00:12:06):
... [inaudible 00:12:06] on the other side of it. It's a whole new journey. Look, he's a smart kid. He's going to do great. But it helped me actually think back to when I learned how to drive. Actually, what I think is maybe a little bit more important here is before you learn to drive. And so, if you think about it as a ... When you're a kid, cars just go places. You get strapped in and you just wait and you get impatient. Then eventually you go somewhere. You're not even consciously aware of the concept of driving. Just cars just happen and you're not even aware of it.

(00:12:41):
As you get a little bit older, you start to become curious. You start to figure out, oh, that wheel has something to do with it. You turn the wheel. Maybe you start to understand there's pedals. But it also just seems really simple. Just like you get in the car and you drive it and you go somewhere. Maybe as you get older, you end up maybe even being a little bit of a smart Alec about how easy it looks and you start talking to your parents about, like, "It doesn't look hard. I can do this."

(00:13:07):
Now suddenly you're behind the wheel of the car. This is what my son is doing. Wow. Is it different than you thought it was going to be? Is it way more complicated? You have to remember check your mirrors. You've got to look before you turn. You didn't even know what that sign meant. You didn't know what those stripes meant. It is just overloading with complication and your internal mindset for confronting this challenge is not going to suit you the way you used to approach the world.

(00:13:44):
Maybe to put it in product leadership, product terms, everyone around you has got some real pithy advice about the things you're forgetting to do. It's like, "Hey, don't forget to check your mirror." Everyone's got a framework. It's like, "Ah, do you know about the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Wait, what's the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?" "Oh, you just put your left hand on the 10:00, your right hand on the 2:00. That's the only thing you're missing. Here's a great medium post about that." Then you're like, "This is a problem is I have not adapted to the complexity of the world around me."

(00:14:19):
And so, there is this sense that what is interesting about driving is the world hasn't gotten any more complex. Driving's always been driving. But now your place in the world has shifted such that the internal meaning-making and self-complexity that is required requires a complete reboot of the internal operating system in order to allow you to thrive there.

(00:14:41):
And so, when you talk about this question of how much of this is skills, how much of this is tactics, how much of this is learning versus how much is internal growth, the answer is it's both, but the shift that is required is very much around how your inner self can make meaning and respond to the demands of the world around you so that you can succeed and thrive in this mindset shift that happens.

(00:15:09):
The skills matter, but by this point, you're beyond the place where you've learned the skills. There's mastering the skills, but there is this sense of what developmental psychologists call self-complexity, the ability to respond and adapt to that.

(00:15:24):
And so, I think we go through a lot of those shifts in our career. The driving example is simple. Actually, probably too simple, because the world is actually getting more complex for those of us that work in product. I mean every day something changes. It forces us to respond and adapt. So there aren't even rules of the road in product.

(00:15:42):
But I think this is what we're talking about, this question of the internal operating system I develop my ability to restructure it such that I can succeed given the demands that have been placed upon me.

Lenny (00:15:57):
What an amazing analogy. Totally hits home in a good and bad way. It's a really good segue to something I wanted to chat about, something that we talked about before the recording, which is what you're finding to be one of the bigger unlocks for your clients. It's also a concept that you've been spending a lot of time refining and you're finding is helping people shift, and specifically shift their leadership mindset. And so, I'd love to just hear you talk through your thinking there.

Ken Norton (00:16:24):
Yeah, it does sort lead into this. Maybe another analogy that might work for your listeners, if you think about product management, your career arc and where you are challenged from a mindset perspective, in some ways it does feel like the early part of your career. You're learning to play a video game. Hopefully there's a tutorial. Your first job is learning the ropes, somebody's teaching you. You maybe have managers that are giving you simple little missions that you can succeed at and if you fail, the consequences aren't bad.

(00:17:03):
It does feel like a little bit ... And I felt this way, and I talked to a lot of people earlier in their career. It does feel like you're trying to learn the rules of the game, trying to figure out the physics. You want to run up the score.

(00:17:15):
You get better at playing the game. You fail, but you start to develop some confidence that when you fail, you'll learn from it. You'll get better. You get really good at the game. You get promoted, you get rewarded, you unlock new levels, teach other people how to play the game. You start to feel really awesome about yourself.

(00:17:32):
But then suddenly you're put in a place where you realize that the rules of the game aren't so black and white. Maybe there's a long delay now between when you get to see what you did and the score of it. Things start to behave in unexpected ways. The physics start to get weird. You're on a level where you're floating. I don't know what the right metaphor is here.

(00:17:52):
But you start to recognize that there's been this huge change. The most frightening part about it is you look around and everyone is looking at you like you're the designer of the game, and you thought you were playing. That's often what it feels like when you move into a leadership role, to come back to this sense of what got me here is not going to get me there.

(00:18:17):
I work with a lot of leaders and sometimes that's come with a pretty significant cost, this juxtaposition, maybe your happiness, your health, your marriage. There's been this existential crisis of I don't know if I love this anymore. Maybe it leads to burnout. Maybe it's not even that dire. It's just a sense of, well, I'm looking around and I need to be something. I need to unlock something else to continue on this path. There is a sense of stuckness that comes from that.

(00:18:45):
What I've come to realize is this is the precipice of, I think, this pretty fundamental concept in leadership. I'm not the originator of this, so this has come up again and again and again. It's not new. It's going to sound familiar. It's like the flood myth from Gilgamesh showing up in all this oral histories of the world. It's not new.

(00:19:10):
Conscious Leadership Group, an organization that I'm big fan of, they call it above the line versus below the line. Brene Brown calls it daring versus armored leadership, sage versus warrior. Even in the world of sports, there's playing to win versus playing not to lose. It's this concept that's come up again and again. Leadership Circle calls it creative versus reactive, and that's the term I'm going to use. I like that.

(00:19:35):
Here's the distinction. Very simple. Are you responding to the world from a place of fear, where you see problems and threats, you want to be right, you want to be liked, you're defensive as an inward approach, or are you responding to the world from a place of openness, possibility, curiosity, passion, growth, purpose? Very simple concept. Pretty much everyone understands what I mean. It makes sense.

(00:20:11):
Everyone also then immediately says a couple of different things. "That sounds amazing. I'd rather have that," or, "Here are moments when I've felt that," but that's usually followed up by a couple of questions. "I don't know if that works. It doesn't sound very effective. Is it possible?" Then how do you that?

(00:20:38):
The effective part is actually a question we can answer, which is, yes, it is more effective. Bob Anderson, Bill Adams are two management scientists who've written extensively, done a whole bunch of research, and they have looked at every possible dimension you can imagine of success, both leadership capability, they've looked at revenue, brand, profitability, everything, and it's shown, yes, this creative form of leadership is in every possible way positively correlated with success and reactive leadership is negatively correlated. So, yes, it works yet.

(00:21:17):
Yet, according to their research, some 75% of leaders are primarily operating reactively. So most leaders are operating from a place of fear, reacting, seeing problems, and threats. That's because that other question of how do you do it is such a hard one to answer. It's not an easy thing that you flip the switch of. It goes back to this notion of redesigning that internal operating system, so how you confront the world, what underlying belief systems and assumptions you have that are causing you to operate from that place.

Lenny (00:21:55):
Can I ask you a quick question? Just to clarify the two sides, what's a sign that you're in the reactive side of things? I think one thing you said is you're worrying a lot about how people think about you and make sure that they like you. Is there anything else that's going to tell a listener, "Oh, maybe I'm falling into this trap"?

Ken Norton (00:22:13):
Yeah, you've nailed it, which is that fear, like operating from a place of anxiety. There are different ways, depending on our mindsets, our approaches. I like the word postures because it seems to click different ways that we retreat into this reactive mode. Fear and anxiety is the way. That's how you know. You're just like, "Ugh, I'm below the line." I'm just like I'm seeing problems. I'm seeing threats.

(00:22:43):
Our brains are hardwired to do that, so it's not like that's wrong. These are brains that learn to do that, I don't know, on the tundra being chased by wild animals. So this is our normal way of being. There might be different desires and needs that force you to operate that way. We think there's really three of these postures.

(00:23:11):
Anybody is probably more than one of them, so this is not pathologizing. This isn't putting you in a box. But probably one of these will resonate more than the others. Wanting to be approved, wanting to be loved, wanting other people to like you. This was me in my early part of my career.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Same.

Ken Norton (00:23:29):
Yeah. So you're kind of like the heart type. It's sometimes called move toward other people. A lot of that came from my environment. I was coming up with product management. No one necessarily knew what the job even was. I had no authority and most people could just ignore me if they wanted to. And so, I had to meet other people's expectations, please them, want to be accepted by them, seek their approval. It was this what we call a complying approach.

(00:23:58):
Here, this is why this is so vexing is it actually worked really well. It was pretty effective. Other people liked working with me. I listened to them and I considered everyone's needs and made sure everyone felt heard. But there came a point where I gave away so much power that it was hurting me when it came to purpose and execution and decisiveness.

(00:24:22):
And so, again, these aren't bad. There's usually underlying tendencies that are very good. It just starts to have a cost as you become more senior. It's like the gears start to grind to a halt a little bit.

(00:24:35):
Another way is more of a needing to be right head type, protecting one's own ideas, sometimes called a move away from type, distance, arrogance, criticism, retreating into your own ideas and head. Then the other will not be a surprise, is the more controlling, my way or the highway, autocratic will move against wanting to win, wanting to be number one, wanting to excel, wanting dominance, wanting control, this would be another tendency.

(00:25:10):
Often one of those feels natural to you and another one feels just so incredibly distasteful that you can't imagine possibly operating that way. This goes into the underlying beliefs part. If you had told me early in my career, when you saw me being passive and people-pleasing like that, "You've just got to stop caring what other people think, Ken. You've got to be more pushy."

(00:25:41):
People did say that to me. That was pretty common probably in my performance review. It was very common. Even people who worked for me were like, "You need to push back." My only archetype for doing that was the autocratic, controlling type. I was like, "I don't want to be like that. That guy's a jerk. That's a fascist. I don't want to be a fascist. I do care about other people."

(00:26:04):
And so, many of our examples and archetypes are these equally ineffective reactive ways of being. And so, no wonder I didn't want to be like that, because that's also not very effective either. But there was a sense for me of redefining ... This is where coaching is powerful is this what are the underlying assumptions and beliefs that you have that are causing you to fall back on some of these fundamental ways of operating and not let go of them?

(00:26:35):
Because the answer for me wasn't stop caring about other people. I wasn't going to do that. That's a value of mine. It's part of who I am. But take the caring about other people, the empathy, the connection, and direct it in a more creative way where you're operating now from a place of purpose and vision and not reacting and protecting and defending and wanting to be.

(00:26:56):
For me, the key to that was letting go of needing to be liked and redefining it as an admiration that takes place over time. So rather than I want to leave this room with everyone liking me, I started to realize I want to be the type of leader where, a decade later, people say, "I would work with that guy again in a heartbeat." That was part of the unlock for me.

(00:27:25):
Again, I care about other people. That's a natural gift that underlines it. But it's a redefinition of how that serves me, if that makes sense.

Lenny (00:27:34):
Say someone's in that first bucket ... And I was definitely in that first bucket. I still want people to like me and I still probably have flaws there. But say you're a PM and you're like, "Oh, man. That's exactly how I am acting right now." It sounds like is the core of it just a mindset shift, going from I need people to like me to what you just talked about of, okay, I'm going to shift to I just want them to respect me over time? Is that the core of it? I know it's probably not that easy, but how should someone behave during that bucket right now?

Ken Norton (00:28:03):
Yeah. It sounds easy, right? This is part of what's hard about this, is it always sounds easy when you describe it, having gone through the journey. It's sort of like talk to somebody on the summit of Mount Everest and they'll be like, "Yeah. Well, I could just climb this mountain. That's how I got here." You're like, "Okay, wait, that's not that easy." Again, it is very individualized.

(00:28:21):
I think there's an appreciation that you have to understand what is holding you back. This is a lot of the work that I'll do with my clients is what is those underlying expectations? What are these underlying beliefs?

(00:28:40):
I Believe that my style was incompatible with being the leader. I would've said I can't be a CEO because I'm not tough enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not commanding enough. I can't command a room. It's like, okay, what is the underlying belief I'm making about what leadership is there? There's an archetype that I have in my mind that is incompatible with this this way.

(00:29:10):
And so, there's a need to confront that. Okay, what makes you believe the only type of leader is the leader that orders people around? Maybe that's all I've ever seen. Maybe I don't believe it's possible to be another type of leader. Maybe there's an inner critic that is convincing me that that's not who I am, because a part of it is redefinition of what does leadership need for you, for you authentically? What would it be like, in my case, to lead with purpose and be decisive and lead with vision and to have other people felt like they're being brought along and listened to and participated and create safe spaces for other people? That was the question there.

(00:29:47):
It took people challenging my point of view. It took working with a coach, asking me questions, forcing me to see places I'd made connections, that the connections don't really need to be made. There's a lot of instruments and tools we work with in coaching. There's 360-degree assessments that are very helpful here that will start to help you understand, hey, here are places where you're operating actively. Here are places where you're operating really creatively, because, by the way, most people are partially somewhere in that journey. It's a developmental process.

(00:30:17):
And to start to be able to get the feedback, the dopamine hit of seeing when I do it this way, actually it's more effective and it doesn't cost me as much. I'm happier and I'm enjoying it, I'm seeing that it's working, is oftentimes a big part of this because there is this belief that it won't work. The number of times when I'm with a client in coaching and say, "Well, what if you did do that?" and they go, "It just won't work." You realize that there is this wiring in there that needs ... And this is what I talk about, this operating system that needs to be rejiggered to start to make sense of what if it did and how might you know.

Lenny (00:30:55):
The point you just made about how you can realize that you can be successful in a lot of different ways and you don't have to be this one archetype of a leader really resonates with my experience. I actually had an executive coach for a few months, and that was probably the biggest unlock for me. We did the strengths exercise, which a lot of people do. The main thing that she helped me see is you can do all the things that you want to do through the lens of the strengths that you have and not have to force yourself to be good at these other things, because there's many ways to accomplish the same outcomes.

Ken Norton (00:31:29):
That's exactly right. Then once you start to understand that, you start to develop a better way of finding the right place, the right environment, the right role. When we began the conversation, you asked me what brought me into executive coaching. I would feel these ... I would describe it as flying too close to the sun in my career, where I would have a team. I'd be managing a small team. I would love it. I would enjoy it. Then suddenly my team would grow.

(00:31:57):
I'd become more senior than I felt comfortable being. Then I felt like I wasn't getting to do the "real" work anymore. Then I would be just completely disheveled and dissatisfied. Then I'd go try to go find a smaller team or even stop being a manager. It was a very meandering, reactive path. It was like every so often I was catching a wave, and I knew what it felt like to be on the wave, but I didn't know what the characteristics of the wave were.

(00:32:23):
Then through coaching, I was like I love connecting with other people. I like helping people grow. I like helping challenge people. I like helping. Then I was like what are those parts? What if I unpack those? Oh, that's why I loved managing that team of five because I got to do a lot of it. That's why I hated managing a team of 35 because there's no time for it.

(00:32:44):
Then you start to say, okay, well, what if rather than just randomly meandering through my career, I actually elevated needing to connect, wanting to be helpful? Then you're like what would it be like if I wanted the helping professions? It's just a reframing of move through your career in a way that seems externally to fit some definition of success and to start to define that internally.

(00:33:11):
That is the very definition of the reactive versus creative mindset. Reactive, allowing the world to set the expectations and try to meet them versus tap into what your real, true sense of purpose and vision is. Then use that to navigate the world.

Lenny (00:33:28):
It's interesting that so much of this is just mindset. It's not like learning a new skill as a leader or a product manager. It's just seeing yourself in the world differently. All of a sudden you unlock your career. Is that what you find?

Ken Norton (00:33:40):
Absolutely. That's why I think so much of the focus on the skills, the frameworks, it can be limited as you develop these capabilities, because it's inner work. Where we're talking about is this is all me.

(00:33:57):
Now that's empowering. There's empowerment to be able to say I want to change something and it doesn't involve a whole bunch of other people convincing and persuading them, getting into an executive ... This is all me. But it also, in some ways, makes it harder because it is all you. In coaching, it's all about you. It's all about that. Who am I and what matters to me? What underlying belief systems, inner voices are challenging me in ways that I want to be challenged? What is my unique ...

(00:34:31):
I love the word authenticity. It's, like you were just talking about, like what is my authentic way to lead, and then how do I center that rather than trying to fit into someone else's definition of what leadership might be?

(00:34:43):
You may recognize I can't be that authentic way of leader at this place or in this place type of company, but I know how to find it and I'm going to go find it.

Lenny (00:34:55):
Do you have any more examples of either someone uncovering this about themselves, or another mindset shift that you can make in one of these other buckets, similar to the idea of I'll think about people over the long term versus immediately?

Ken Norton (00:35:10):
Yeah. It really does vary. You start to pick up on that shift when it's less of the goals being defined externally and more of the goals being defined internally. So you'll have a conversation with somebody who's new to coaching and you'll say, "What do you want?" They'll be like, "Well, I want to get promoted to VP." "Why?" "Because I want to be a VP." It's like, "Well, what's important about being VP?" "Well, because ... " Eventually the answer is, well, because it's there and that's the thing that I'm supposed to do.

(00:35:45):
Then you start to notice the shift and it starts to become more of, "Well, because really what's important to me is creativity. I want more creativity in my life. I want more ability to challenge other people." And so, you start to just sense that's more from in than from out. That's where that shift is.

(00:36:06):
The journey is different for everyone. I think ultimately this is part of why, quite frankly, coaching may not be right for everyone. If we go back to that video game analogy, if you're looking for someone to just teach you the tutorial so you can learn how to play the video game and there's this jackass like me sitting next to you and saying, "What's important to you about playing this video game?" you're going to be like, "Just can you tell me how to hold the controller? Can you stop?"

(00:36:31):
So it's not always right. It's a place where I think oftentimes people recognize that they've gotten all the advice, all the frameworks, all the rules, all the tricks, all the tips. They've learned that, they've mastered it, they've tweaked it, they've optimized it, they've recognized the shortcomings, they've customized it. The emergence that's required for them to get to the next level is just going to come just as much from inside them as it is from outside, if not more. That's when that shift is made.

Lenny (00:36:58):
That's called mentorship, I think, for people that are just looking for actual concrete advice on how to do a thing, is that right, versus coaching?

Ken Norton (00:37:05):
I think so. This is where the words are squishy because there are a lot of people who are mentoring, who are also stepping into a coach role occasionally. There are plenty of managers who are great at coaching as necessary. So skills run the gamut, but it's a question of how much are you looking for someone to tell you the right way versus how much do you believe that there even is no right way? It's ultimately going to have to be your way.

(00:37:33):
That's a different place, a different point in your career at different levels of journey. It's part of why I tend to work with probably more senior executives, because they're not looking to me to tell them how to do the job. They've already learned how to do the job. It's just something deeper that's going to need to break through from that.

Lenny (00:37:50):
This episode is brought to you by Unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList head of product, "Banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack."

(00:38:12):
Embedding banking into your product not only adds differentiation, but also helps you acquire, retain, and monetize your customers. Unit is the market leader in banking as a service, combining multiple bank partners with a developer-friendly API to empower companies of all sizes to launch accounts, cards, payments, and lending in just a few weeks.

(00:38:33):
Unit is trusted by leading brands such as AngelList, Highbeam, Invoice2go, and Roofstock. To hear more about how Unit enables companies like yours to build banking, visit unit.co/lenny to request a demo or to try their free sandbox. That's unit.co/lenny.

(00:38:51):
For someone that wants to do the work, but can't find a coach, can't afford a coach, is there something people can do on their own that you'd recommend to help them shift their mindset and do a lot of these things that you've been describing?

Ken Norton (00:39:06):
Yeah, it's a great question. Here's the secret about the coaching industry. Anyone can call themselves a coach. It's very democratized. It's great. There's no gatekeepers and barriers and there's no 500 licenses you have to go through.

(00:39:22):
There are tons of great coaches who are at various different price levels, at different levels of accessibility. And so, if you say, "I can't afford a coach," I might challenge that a little bit and say have you looked?

(00:39:36):
The other thing is that you don't need a coach who's done the job before. I mean obviously I've done the job before, so I'm undermining part of my own selling point here. But coaches are trained to coach people on any topic. So when I go through coach training, I can coach you on anything. People can coach you on anything.

(00:39:52):
Sometimes even there might be power in having a coach that's never done the product management job because there won't be any cheating of starting to move into a more of advisor role or maybe as the coach either. There may be, "Well, you tell me what should I should do," and the person would be like, "I don't know. I've never done this job. Let's go back to what you want." So there could be some benefit from that. Again, you don't have to have done that.

(00:40:13):
So I would say coaching is incredibly powerful. I wish I'd had a coach much, much earlier in my career. And so, the answer may be coaching is more accessible than you thought. If not, I think the things that we're talking about here are internal understanding of what matters to you, your sense of purpose, this inner curiosity, and that could be harnessed at any age. So just wondering about yourself at any point in your career, wondering what's important to you.

(00:40:43):
I love doing values work, like, "What are your values? Okay. No. What really are your values?" That's something you can do yourself. That's something you can question. You can read about, you can start to understand.

(00:40:53):
Mentors can be great, especially mentors who are less about trying to tell you the right way and get you to follow directly their path, but are more they're applying some curiosity, asking questions, challenging you in certain ways, being a way that you can bounce ideas off of.

(00:41:09):
Great managers, I think, especially the best product leaders, understand how to put the coach hat on and when it's appropriate to put the coach hat on, and are explicit about that, are like, "Okay, let me take off my manager hat now and put the coach hat on. What do you really want to do, Lenny? What's important to you? What's your career?" And so, I think you can get coaching from everywhere.

(00:41:28):
There's a lot of self-coaching you can do. This is honestly one of the benefits for me having gone through tons of training and coaching is starting to coach myself, like feeling an emotion and asking myself coach questions. Really powerful. That's something you can do when you've had a coach. You can do it when you don't have a coach. You can explore it.

(00:41:46):
So I think this is really all about really being curious and wanting to understand who you really are at the core and what's important to you and what matters. That's something that can be done with or without a coach.

Lenny (00:41:58):
Are there any resources that you love for either the values work or learning these questions to ask yourself? We can put them in the show notes if nothing comes to mind immediately. But is there something you recommend people check out?

Ken Norton (00:42:08):
Yeah, there are some great books. Maybe I'll use this opportunity to throw out a couple suggestions.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Let's do it.

Ken Norton (00:42:14):
I guess we can link it into the show notes. Brene Brown's Dare to Lead. It's a good book. She actually even has a whole section in there around values, confronting her values. I like her approach. There's some free resources on her website.

(00:42:26):
I love Conscious Leadership Group's work here. The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership book is fantastic. You don't even need to buy the book. There's a ton of stuff on their website. Jim Dethmer, Diana Chapman and Kaley Warner Klemp are of the authors of that book. That's all about a lot of the stuff we've been talking about. They're the ones that have the above the line versus below the line that fits into this creative versus reactive standpoint. Those are all fantastic.

(00:42:57):
If you want to go deeper into more of the management science behind it, if you're like me and really curious about the psychology and the management science, Bob Anderson and Bill Adams's book, Mastering Leadership, creates the entire integrated system around creative versus reactive.

(00:43:19):
As a teaser, they identify five levels of leadership, of which reactive is the second, creative is the third. So beyond that, you get into integral and unitive. So if you're looking to unlock the advanced stages beyond creative, there's a lot of great stuff in there. Those are where all the research comes in as well.

(00:43:38):
From an adult development standpoint, Robert Kegan is the godfather of the adult-stage development work and the meaning-making that underlines a lot of this. He has a great book called Immunity to Change if you're curious about that.

Lenny (00:43:52):
Awesome. We will link to all those in the description of this podcast so folks don't have to Google around. I have a couple of more coaching questions before we move on to a few other topics. One is just what are you finding are the most common blind spots for product people in general? How are people shooting themselves in the foot most?

Ken Norton (00:44:11):
Oh, that's a great question. I think probably the number one category, I'm not sure it's necessarily a problem, but maybe category or problems, is ... And this is, I think, great lesson for people earlier in their career, is how much all of the challenges that senior executives are dealing with come down to people versus product. So it's like it's fun to think about designing products, optimizing, doing user discovery, and testing what, but it's like you sit down with an executive and it's all about people.

(00:44:47):
That's the hard part. It's about persuading people, getting groups of people to want to work together, trying to figure out how to deal with difficult personalities, figuring out how to set a vision and articulate a vision, create an environment where people can collaborate and play.

(00:45:01):
And so, I think this category of blind spot often is people being confronted with that without having been intentional about thinking of it as a skill or an area that they needed to work on, needed to improve.

(00:45:18):
Part of what I think is pretty exciting about product management is you are a leader from day one in product management. There's leadership all over the place, but that's your job. You're a leader. You don't have any formal authority, but you're a leader. You're expected to lead.

(00:45:39):
Guess what? The hardest part about being a leader is when you don't get to just rely on the formal authority. So you're getting to practice all the hard parts about leadership from day one, because you're nobody's boss. You get to sharpen those skills, develop those intuitions, get better and better at that, so that when you do someday, if this is right for you, become someone else's boss, you've already been able to lean into that.

(00:46:04):
And so, the people side of this is such an incredible aspect of what product management is. What I find, and this may be a category of blind spots, is people realizing that when they're put in a position where they're expected to have impact and realizing that they haven't developed the skills, they haven't developed the capability to actually be able to manage and work through all these people, which is ...

Lenny (00:46:33):
How do you actually get better at that or develop those skills?

Ken Norton (00:46:37):
Yeah. I just think recognizing it is part of the job. It's important. Maybe I came up at a certain time where it was often dismissed as soft skills. It's just like soft skills are helpful, but they're not actually something you want to work on. They're not something you train, not something you ...

(00:46:54):
And this is just as important. This is the equal ... I wrote a piece recently about the art versus the science. The art is communication, collaboration, the more fuzzy, softer skills, people stuff. It's an elevation of that being just as important, if not more important, over time, as all this skills, techniques, tactics, managing a backlog, all that kind of stuff that you have to do. You should invest in that the same way you invest in those other skills.

(00:47:25):
So if you go off to a training to learn a technique for doing, I don't know, some sort of technical dashboard analysis, why don't you go to training to learn how to have difficult conversations? Because there's some great training about having difficult conversations, or do some training about storytelling. These are all really, really important factors that start to come into play.

(00:47:54):
What I would recommend is just appreciating that these are going to really, really matter and practicing and then valuing them and not thinking of them as something that either will matter later or a distraction or not really part of the job.

Lenny (00:48:07):
I think the reason people don't do that work is because it's so hard. Difficult conversations are difficult. We talked about this with Trey Hass. But just like it's a rule of thumb, the thing that is hard is probably the thing you should be doing. It's like a compass point of you to the thing you should do.

Ken Norton (00:48:23):
Absolutely. We are all about doing hard stuff, product managers. That's what we're all about. And so, when something seems hard and it seems squishy and it seems like it's difficult to put a three-step rule around, chances are it's really going to matter. It goes back to this mindset shift. That means that there's an opportunity for you to readjust your inner complexity management system to adapt to that area of complexity that you're now seeing, because this stuff really feels squishy. And so, that's even more of a reason why you want to get your hands around it and grab onto it and value it and learn and grow from it.

Lenny (00:49:07):
Speaking of difficult and squishy, I'm guessing that one of the biggest challenges that people you work with face and one of the most recurring themes is imposter syndrome, people having imposter syndrome, something definitely I went through and it comes up a lot on this podcast. What do you usually advise your clients to do when they're feeling imposter syndrome?

Ken Norton (00:49:27):
Yeah, it's a great question. I always get corrected to say imposter phenomenon by people in the psychology community, because I guess it's not a dysfunction. And so, I've learned to use their terms. But, yeah, I think just about everyone experiences it at some point. Research shows that that definitely is born out ... It's really the moments when you're doubting your abilities or you feel like a fraud or you feel like you don't belong.

(00:49:54):
It's funny because as I'm interrogating my own inner emotional state right now, I'm feeling it a little bit, because there's a part of me right now that's just like, "You're not a trained psychologist." When I said that whole thing, well, it's technically a phenomenon, there's a voice that was like, "What are you talking about? You don't know what you're talking about. Who are you [inaudible 00:50:14] on this?"

Lenny (00:50:14):
We'll put a disclaimer on the episode.

Ken Norton (00:50:16):
Yeah, I'm not a psychologist. So, look, we all feel it. There's a part of me right now that's like I'm going to say the wrong thing and embarrass myself. Product managers, product leaders maybe more so because the role is so cross-functional and ill-defined. There's always going to be an edge of the job that you aren't as qualified as whoever you're interacting with. It's the nature of it. Look, we're never going to be as good as an engineer, as good as a designer, as good ... So there's all these opportunities for that.

(00:50:40):
I find, certainly from client work, that there is a little bit of a softening and solidarity just knowing that. I'm just like, "Oh, you have that, too? Oh, I have that. Yeah, there's some value to that."

(00:50:51):
I think it's important to pause here and say that there is the risk of dismissing or even maybe weaponizing imposter phenomenon against particular populations, particularly women, people of color of all genders, women of color especially, who are facing real external feedback and doubt about their abilities.

(00:51:15):
The environment is reinforcing and the source of a lot of this stuff, microaggressions, bias, real aggressions. And so, I think we always have to be careful in the helping professions to not dismiss it as a problem that just shifts the obligation to the person. So it's like, "Oh, that's just your imposter syndrome. Deal with it." Well, it's really easy to overlook all these systemic issues that are leading to that imposter syndrome.

(00:51:39):
So the leaders I work with, I think we have a special obligation both to confront our own inner dynamic, but also to recognize what our role is in the broader environment that might be contributing to some of this stuff. If you're a leader, you have a special obligation to dismantle those, not when you're meeting with your people, be like, "Ah, it's just your imposter syndrome. You can work through it. Hire a coach," but to be able to recognize, "Okay, wait, what signals are you getting? What issues are contributing to this? What's our role in needing to change that?" So I think that's worth pointing out.

(00:52:13):
By the way, there's a great article in Harvard Business Review from a couple of years ago. I think the title was literally Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome. The two authors of that were Ruchika Tulshyan and Jodi-Ann Burey, if you're curious and you want to go into more depth on that.

(00:52:29):
As coaches there, there's all sorts of ways we're trained to work with this. Oftentimes as an inner critic and inner voice, we all have voices, saboteurs. They're often trying to help us, they have good intentions, but they're developed to try to protect us in certain ways. So gaining awareness of those, just sort of like, "Oh, that is an inner critic. That's what it's trying to do." There's a self-distancing that's valuable to that, really kind of ...

(00:52:54):
I like to think of it a little bit as you got inner border directors, and there's some noisy, chatty voices that every so often sit in the chairperson's seat and start taking over. If you start to recognize, "Wait, no, I'm the chairperson. I don't want to hear from you right now. We'll hear from you later," it starts to create some power and you start to notice when it's happening.

(00:53:16):
We bypass inner critic sometimes as a classic coaching technique. It's like, "Okay, I'm sounding that's your inner critic is saying that. What if we just ask it to maybe step aside? Let's keep talking here."

(00:53:28):
You can befriend it. There's a lot of practices and works just actually trying to understand what its motivations are. You can think of it as a board. Give this board member a new job, put it on a new committee, reassign it.

(00:53:41):
There's oftentimes underlying belief systems. We talked before about my impression of what a real leader was and who they had to be. And so, hey, when all those second-guessing of me not being a real leader, of me not being qualified came from some of those underlying assumptions, that that was the only type of leader that was effective, was somebody that was slamming their fist out on the table.

(00:54:02):
Okay, so what if we redefine that? I'm too kind to be a leader. I'm not dominating, commanding enough. When you hear a client say that as a coach, you recognize, okay, there's a connection being made here between what effective leadership is and isn't. Let's interrogate that connection. Is that connection actually true?

(00:54:21):
Again, it get backs to this question of you're often responding to other styles, approaches you've seen. You're comparing yourself to others. So this is the reactive mindset of I'm always comparing myself to that person, to that wave, that being, and seeing myself as lesser then. And so, the inner work of starting to see who I really am truly inside and less comparing myself to others.

(00:54:42):
But, yeah, imposter phenomenon, syndrome, whatever you want to call it, very common and very popular, I suppose. Although when I say popular, it's like popular like a play.

Lenny (00:54:53):
Right. Another inner critic tactic I've heard that I used for a bit that was helpful is to give your inner critic a name, like Jim. I mean like, "Jim, not right now. I don't need you right now." That kind of helps.

Ken Norton (00:55:06):
Yeah. There is a whole school of coaching that I've worked with that's called parts work or internal family systems. It comes from a psychologist named Richard Schwartz who determined this. It can be really, really powerful.

(00:55:19):
I'll word my clients and we will give them names. We will imagine what they look like. They will interview these parts. If you've seen the Pixar movie Inside Out, this notion that like, hey, all these different parts show up in different ways. I'm going to put myself, the real me, the real self into the chairperson's seat. When I hear these voices, I'm going to appreciate them from what they are and who they are. They're not me. They're parts of me.

(00:55:46):
There's something really powerful in that, in that sense of like ... Because, otherwise, they're all me. So I just hear this voice telling me I'm an idiot and I'm a clown and I'm not qualified to be in this room. Then when you can start to go, "Oh, yeah, there it is. That's Larry Loser. My big angry, irritating judge who's, of course ... Oh, yeah, Larry always shows up every time I do something new, because Larry doesn't want me to challenge myself. So, of course, Larry's going to pipe in. I've heard from Larry. I'm going to ask Larry to step aside. Let's go." Yeah, it can be very powerful.

Lenny (00:56:22):
I love that. One last question about coaching. For folks that want to find a coach, do you have any advice of just how to find a coach, and then what are a couple questions you can ask to evaluate if they're a good fit for you?

Ken Norton (00:56:35):
Yeah, great question. So I think, like any helping profession, finding a therapist or really anyone who you're going to have a deep and lasting relationship with, this sort of trust and authenticity is really important. I think we all, as coaches, recognize, and we feel this as well with clients, is it either has to be a fit or not. Sometimes it's hard to put your finger on it. Sometimes you meet with someone and you're like, "Yeah, it clicks. It feels right." Sometimes you're like, "Eh, it doesn't," and that's okay. And so, all coaches worth their salt will offer a free session to understand that, engage that.

(00:57:13):
I always tell everyone in that session, if you don't decide to work with me or I decide ... We don't need a reason. It's fine. It's just not a fit, and that's okay. You don't need to come up with bullet point reasons to let me down. It's part of how it goes.

(00:57:28):
You might prefer certain people, certain gender, certain backgrounds. You may feel more comfortable or less comfortable with ... Maybe you want an old guy like me. Maybe you want an old guy like me, and that's fine. It has to feel right.

(00:57:41):
I would ask them to talk to you about what coaching is to them, because, again, it might combine some of these more mentory things. It might be more tactical. Some coaches are more structured, "Week one, we're going to do this. Week two, we're going to do this. Week ... " Others are more pure coaches like me, where, look, within the first five minutes, I'm going to ask you what you want to talk about today, because you're bringing the agenda. So figure that out. Figure out what works for you.

(00:58:07):
Then I think there's a lot of great places to go. Actually, specifically where to go, the International Coaching Federation is our governing body. So those of us that are credentialed coaches you'll find there. Again, you don't have to be credentialed, but that'll be a great place to find people who are.

(00:58:23):
There are some matchmaking services, BetterUp, Torch, or some of the more accessible ones. There's one called Prismaticco. It's a little bit more higher end for more senior execs. Scale just put out a list of top coaches who work with product managers and product leaders, all sorts of great coaches. We can include that link. Lenny, I think you're involved.

Lenny (00:58:43):
Yeah. Congrats on winning one of their categories for best coach of ... Which category was that?

Ken Norton (00:58:49):
Product leaders. So, yeah, this was just a setup for you to say that. But thank you. But there's tons of great coach, and different styles, different stages of careers. I think all those folks have work with or have worked with product folks.

(00:59:03):
And so, again, just talk to a few. Reach out to a few. Ask them. If you're looking for more names, ask people who you admire, whose leadership styles you like and want to emulate, who they recommend, because oftentimes they have a better understanding of, hey, this is the type of coach that may want to work with, more of the emotional work, or this is the type of coach who actually maybe has a more compatible vision of what you're looking for, because, look, all coaches are different. You can tell I'm a touchy-feely heart coach.

(00:59:35):
There are coaches who are ... Sometimes people want a coach and they're just like, "You grab that brass ring. We're going to pound the table. I'm going to push you. I'm going to challenge you. I'm going to beat you up. I'm going to be more of a drill sergeant." That's a different style of coach that works with other people. That may be more what you're looking for.

(00:59:50):
So I would just talk to a bunch, do some free sessions, get an opportunity to explore it. I coach people in the free session. So it's not just like we're talking. We're going to talk about something. I'm going to coach you. You're going to get a sense of what this looks like. Then come away and just ask yourself, what are your goals and where was there a fit? If there's not, just keep looking.

Lenny (01:00:09):
Amazing. That was very tactically helpful. I really appreciate all those resources. We'll definitely link to all that in the description. I have just a couple questions I wanted to ask you outside of coaching, around some of your posts that you've written before we get to our exciting lightning round. One is around this idea of 10X versus 10%.

(01:00:26):
So you wrote this post about the importance of thinking 10X versus 10%. Truthfully, I actually had a post started, "10X versus 10%." I was like, "Oh, this is going to be great." Then I Googled, "Oh, Ken's already written about it." So I'm glad that you have written about it and written about it so well.

Ken Norton (01:00:41):
Great minds think alike, as they say.

Lenny (01:00:44):
Now I don't have to write it. I'd love to just hear your general take on what this idea is and how to think about 10X or 10% bets.

Ken Norton (01:00:53):
Again, I'm a great synthesizer of ideas. This isn't my idea. This is a lot of ... It came from some thinking at Google and some push. I think it's really the sense that we think too small sometimes. You'll see that as a theme for some of the other things I've written too. There needs to be a push. If you really want to have huge breakthrough innovation, you need to be able to try, you need to be able to fail. You need to be able to shoot for the moon is where this 10X comes from.

(01:01:22):
A lot of it is mindset, but a lot of it is also cultural. It's creating environments where ... And I had the great privilege of working at Google for 14 years. I felt like it was definitely an environment that I got to play in, of being willing to take big swings that might fail.

(01:01:36):
This doesn't mean that the company could all be out of business tomorrow. But it's like if you have a choice between trying something that could have a massive breakthrough, a massive change, and playing small ball where you're going to get a bunch of 10% improvements, you are over time, if you're willing to try, if you're willing to fail, if you're willing to push yourself, if you're willing to think bigger, if you're willing to create environments, great ideas come from places that are unexpected, you'll achieve massive, massive breakthrough.

(01:02:02):
You can find the piece on my website, because I use examples from history, but it is a little bit of being brave and trying big things. If you look at all the great technology, the huge breakthrough innovations that we've had, the coronavirus vaccine, just this ... Man, there is no small balling that. That was a big, big swing that there was no guarantee of success, but we were willing to try it. We were willing to fail knowing that failure was probably the more likely outcome in the chance that we would achieve something that would really have that level of breakthrough.

(01:02:36):
And so, I think it is what I always challenge leaders to do is create the environment where people can step in and bring those types of ideas, and not play it safe or not be like, "Ah, boy, that seems like a big one. If we bring that to the CEO, there's no way they'll take a chance. So let's ramp down our expectations. Let's bring this little idea in that is a little bit more guaranteed to work."

(01:03:01):
And so, it is the obligation of leaders to create that environment for people to be able to innovate, because the ideas are out there. I use the example of Kodak. Kodak invented the digital camera. It wasn't like, oh, people at Kodak were dumb. They didn't know digital was coming. No, they literally invented the digital camera. There just wasn't an environment created where the people who had that idea, who saw that potential, who saw that possibility could step up through the plate and try.

Lenny (01:03:29):
Do you have any rules of thumb of how many of your ideas/resources should go into these big ideas versus incremental 10% bets, or is the general advice just like people aren't thinking big enough, often enough, so you should always think a little bit bigger than you naturally will?

Ken Norton (01:03:44):
I think it depends. I mean it depends on the company. If you work in R&D, in labs, maybe everything is in that category and you build a portfolio. If you're a venture capital seed investor, or if you're working at a research lab, it's like you're building a huge portfolio of these bets. You're just assuming that maybe 99 of them will fail, but one will succeed and it'll make it all worthwhile.

(01:04:09):
Most of us aren't in those environments. We're in places where we have real customers buying our products, wanting our products, using our products. We're like, "Let's bet the entire company own 50 things that may not work out." It may not be right for you.

(01:04:20):
So I think it is a little bit of an approach. I think it needs to be thought of in a fractal way, though, because maybe at the company level, they're thinking Google once upon a time had a 70-20-10 thing, whereas 70% is our core business. It's the time we're searching ads. 20% is adjacent business, and then 10% on crazy bets that may not be anything.

(01:04:43):
But I think that's at the company level. At the individual level, at your team level, you might have your own way of thinking. You're just like, okay, I've got 12 engineers on the team. We're working on, at any time, a bunch of stuff that we know we have to do. This is a bunch of stuff that we hope is like 10%. Then we're going to create some space for some innovation. Maybe it's just one engineer every sprint, or it's like a couple of times a year.

(01:05:09):
You create that type of space in your own little air bubble that isn't necessarily at the portfolio level, to try things that may not work. But if they do, the payoff will be so substantial that it'll make the whole thing worthwhile.

Lenny (01:05:23):
Awesome. Very helpful. Next question is around I think your most popular post that you've ever written, and maybe the thing that put you on the radar of writing, is around how to hire a product manager. Maybe this is where you mentioned donuts the first time. Is that right, or no?

Ken Norton (01:05:40):
It's funny. I think that was later.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Okay.

Ken Norton (01:05:43):
Yeah, I think that was a talk that came after that.

Lenny (01:05:45):
Okay, cool.

Ken Norton (01:05:46):
Yeah, that was definitely the big one for me.

Lenny (01:05:48):
So here's the question, just to keep it simple, what's one piece of advice that you would give people trying to hire a product manager? What's the thing that you think is most maybe missed or useful?

Ken Norton (01:06:00):
Yeah, I think the intangibles. So basically I wrote that originally as an email, that it was a copy pasta thing for me, where people kept coming to me and being like, "Hey, I think we're going to try to hire a product manager or a company. Can you send over a sample job description?" I'd be like, "Yeah. Before we write the job description, let's talk about what the job is, because I'm not sure we all mean the same thing." And so, then I wrote that ... It was in 2005, so this goes back ... to try to define what the role actually is.

(01:06:31):
I actually feel like maybe the pendulum shifted way too far now where it's the interview process is so structured. Everyone's doing all these mock. They know exactly what questions they're going to get. It's SAT prep. Everyone's ready. But we've missed out with can they do the job? Because it's like they can pass the interview, but can they do the job?

(01:06:53):
And so, I think you have to be careful. This is particularly the case if you are a smaller company. You don't have a huge apparatus of Google and Meta, where you've got interviewing monolith of getting persuaded into ... Maybe this goes back a little bit to the science and the art. They passed all the technical questions. They do all this, they do all that. They do all that. But then you neglect to find out can this person show up and work with these engineers, these designers? Can they inspire them? Is this somebody that they want to follow? Do they have the right mindset for what this job entails? Do we even have an agreement on what their job is going to be?

(01:07:35):
The number of people you see earlier in their career will be like, "Well, I thought I was hiring for this, but it turns that's not even product management," or it was like, "I thought I was going to do this, but all they want me to do is build fee." It's like how'd that not come out in the group process? It's like, well, I know how it didn't come out because they answered a whole bunch of structured questions around ... They did a programming exercise and they did a presentation and nobody stopped to ask.

(01:07:55):
And so, I think that's really the big thing from an interviewer perspective. I think same thing goes for the candidate's perspective. You are interviewing a potential employer. You're interviewing a boss. You're interviewing coworkers. What do you want? What do you care about? What is the type of place you want to be in? What do you not want to be in? How are you evaluating that? How are you asking those questions?

(01:08:18):
Yeah, salary matters, title. All that kind of stuff matters. But you're interviewing a place to plop yourself into. How are you approaching that to make sure you're making the right decision?

Lenny (01:08:30):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round, where I'm going to ask you a few questions and whatever comes to mind, just give me an answer. That's it. Very simple. Does that sound good?

Ken Norton (01:08:43):
Yeah. Inner critic is raging right now.

Lenny (01:08:45):
Oh, no. Real-time imposter syndrome.

Ken Norton (01:08:48):
Here we go.

Lenny (01:08:49):
[inaudible 01:08:49].

Ken Norton (01:08:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:08:50):
Okay. So question one, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Ken Norton (01:08:55):
Oh, 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership. Definitely on that book. I'd just add books I've never recommended before. Probably Innovators Dilemma. It's probably my number one favorite book for product managers and product leaders.

Lenny (01:09:09):
Amazing. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've liked?

Ken Norton (01:09:14):
I love Ms. Marvel. My whole family were really enjoying it. I love all the MCU stuff. We just eat it up. Ms. Marvel has been amazing. Then watching Barry, which is crazy. It's sort of like nothing else I think ever on TV. Then, over the last year, probably Severance. It's my favorite program over the last ... I'd say last year.

Lenny (01:09:34):
Wow. Yeah. That is a trippy show. I've watched it all. We might be severed people, we don't even know.

Ken Norton (01:09:39):
You won't even know.

Lenny (01:09:41):
Okay. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask folks when you interview them?

Ken Norton (01:09:46):
Well, actually let me flip it because I just talked about interviewing as the interview ... Maybe I'll ask a favorite question for people who are being interviewed to ask the employer. Is that fair or is that turn the tables too much?

Lenny (01:09:58):
I love it. Yes.

Ken Norton (01:09:59):
I think a great question ... Actually maybe I have a couple. I think one question that I love is how does the company define a product team? Because it answers so much. It says so much about culture, collaboration, decision-making, the role of product management. If there's one question and you could figure out what is this culture like, it would be asking that.

(01:10:20):
I think another great question for candidates is to ask them to pick an example of something they've shipped recently and just talk about how it came to be. How did the bill become a law? Was it somebody in sales yelled and it got added to the backlog and it was the next thing? Is it a group of people together understanding customer user needs through discovery and ideating and trying some things and testing it? It says a lot about what it would be like to work there, particularly when it comes to empowerment and product culture. So those are probably two good questions.

Lenny (01:10:58):
Those are really good questions. I'm going to steal them. Final question, who else in the industry do you respect as a thought leader? I imagine this list is very long, but what comes to mind?

Ken Norton (01:11:06):
Well, this list is all of my fellow podcast guests on your podcast, Lenny, which is, speaking of imposter phenomenon, is just an incredible group of all the folks that I love and admire. I think, though, because ... Maybe I'll answer it a little bit outside of product, because I would worry that I would leave out too many great names.

(01:11:26):
In the realms of leadership, Amy Edmondson is somebody I really admire. She's done a lot of the work on psychological safety. I really, really value her work, her contributions. There's a guy named Tom Garrity, who has a newsletter about psychological safety. I think he's collaborated with Amy before. It's one of the best, not the best newsletter I received, Lenny, maybe the second best, about psychological safety for those of us that are wanting to create environments where people can really thrive and do their best.

(01:12:05):
In the coaching profession, I mean the coaching profession emerges from the humanist psychology traditions or the client-first work of ... Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow are intellectual heroes of mine. They're both dead. I don't know if we're supposed to talk about living people here, but definitely as I think about in my profession, they really set the stage and created the environment that coaching could even exist. So I'll include them.

Lenny (01:12:36):
Amazing. Ken, this was such a special episode, unlike any other podcast that I've had so far. I can't wait for people to listen to it. Before I let you go, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and then how can listeners be helpful to you?

Ken Norton (01:12:51):
Yeah, bringthedonuts.com is my home on the worldwide web. All my writing is there. You can get in contact with me there. I have a newsletter that I am occasionally send out, but you can find all the stuff that I've ever written and get in contact with me there.

(01:13:09):
The how to help be helpful question is a really easy one to answer, but that brings me a lot of joy, which is just keep being awesome product folks. You're so much my tribe. You're so close to my heart, all the work that you do, everything you bring into the world, the amazing products that we get to use that I'm sure you're working on right now that we haven't even seen yet, that you can't wait to share with us, and the cultures and teams that you make better, so your very existence. So I would say you can be helpful to me by just keep doing what you're doing.

Lenny (01:13:41):
What an awesome answer. Thank you for being here, Ken.

Ken Norton (01:13:43):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (01:13:46):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast and, even better, leave a review, which helps a lot. You can also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

## Transcript

Kevin Weil (00:00:00):
The AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life, and when you actually get that in your head, it's kind of wild. Everywhere I've ever worked before this, you kind of know what technology you're building on, but that's not true at all with AI. Every two months, computers can do something they've never been able to do before and you need to completely think differently about what you're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
You're chief product officer of maybe the most important company in the world right now. I want to chat about what it's just like to be inside the center of the storm.

Kevin Weil (00:00:29):
Our general mindset is in two months, there's going to be a better model and it's going to blow away whatever the current set of limitations are. And we say this to developers too. If you're building and the product that you're building is kind of right on the edge of the capabilities of the models, keep going because you're doing something right. Give it another couple months and the models are going to be great, and suddenly the product that you have that just barely worked is really going to sing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
Famously, you led this project at Facebook called Libra.

Kevin Weil (00:00:56):
Libra is probably the biggest disappointment of my career. It fundamentally disappoints me that this doesn't exist in the world today because the world would be a better place if we'd been able to ship that product. We tried to launch a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger. I would be able to send you 50 cents in WhatsApp for free. It should exist. To be honest, the current administration is super friendly to crypto. Facebook's reputation is in a very different place. Maybe they should go build it now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Kevin Weil. Kevin is chief product officer at OpenAI, which is maybe the most important and most impactful company in the world right now, being at the forefront of AI and AGI and maybe someday super intelligence. He was previously head of product at Instagram and Twitter. He was co-creator of the Libra Cryptocurrency at Facebook, which we chat about. He's also on the boards of Planet and Strava and the Black Product Managers Network and the Nature Conservancy. He's also just a really good guy and he has so much wisdom to share. We chat about how OpenAI operates, implications of AI and how we will all work and build product, which markets within the AI ecosystem, companies like OpenAI won't likely go after and thus are good places for startups to own. Also, why learning the craft of writing evals is quickly becoming a core skill for product builders, what skills will matter most in an AI era and what he's teaching his kids to focus on and so much more.

Kevin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kevin Weil (00:05:23):
Thank you so much for having me. We've been talking about doing this forever and we made it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):
We did it. I can't imagine how insane your life is, so I really appreciate that you made time for this and we're actually recording this the week that you guys launched your new image model, which is a happy coincidence. My entire social feed is filled with ghiblifications of everyone's life and family photos and everything, so good job.

Kevin Weil (00:05:45):
Yep, mine too. My wife, Elizabeth, sent me one of hers, so I'm right there with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
Let me just ask, did you guys expect this kind of reaction? It feels like this is the most viral thing that's happened in AI, which a high bar since, I don't know, ChatGPT launched. Just like, did you guys expect it to go this well? What does it feel like internally?

Kevin Weil (00:06:04):
There have been a handful of times in my career when you're working on a product internally and the internal usage just explodes. This was true by the way when we were building stories at Instagram. More than anything else in my career, we could feel it was going to work because we were all using it internally and we'd go away for a weekend. Before it launched we were all using it and we'd come back after a weekend and we would know what was going on and be like, "Oh, hey, I saw you were at that camping trip, how was that?" You were like, "Man, this thing really works." ImageGen was definitely one of those, so we'd been playing with it for, I don't know, a couple months and when it first went live internally to the company, there was kind of a little gallery where you could generate your own, you could also see what everyone else was generating and it was just nonstop buzz. So yeah, we had a sense that this was going to be a lot of fun for people to play with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):
That's really cool. That should be a measure of just confidence into something going well that you're launching is internally everyone's going crazy for it.

Kevin Weil (00:07:05):
Yeah. Especially social things because you have a very tight network as a company socially, so you know each other and you're experts in your product hopefully. And so there's some sense in which if you're doing something social and it's not taking off internally, you might question what you're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:23):
Yeah, and by the way, the Ghibli thing, is that something you guys seeded or how did that even start? Was that an intentional example?

Kevin Weil (00:07:29):
I think it's just the style people love and the model is really capable at emulating style or understanding what... It's very good at instruction following. That's actually something that I think people... I'm starting to see people discover with it, but you can do very complex things. You can give it two images, one is your living room and the other is a whole bunch of photos or memorabilia or things you want and you say, "Tell me how you would arrange these things." Or you can say, "I'd like you to show me what this will look like if you put this over here and this thing to the right of that and this one to the left of this, but under that one." And the model actually will understand all of that and do it. It's incredibly powerful. So I'm just excited about all the different things people are going to figure out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):
Yeah. All right. Well, good job. Good job team OpenAI. Let's get serious here and let's zoom out a little bit. The way I see it is you're chief product officer of maybe the most important company in the world right now. Just not to set the bar too high, but you guys are ushering in AI, AGI at some point, super intelligence at some point. No big deal. I have more questions for you than I've had for any other guest. Actually put out a call-out on Twitter and LinkedIn and my community just like what would you want to ask Kevin? And I had over 300 well-formed questions and we're going to go through every single one. So let's just get started. I'm just joking.

Kevin Weil (00:08:45):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:46):
I picked out the best and there's a lot of stuff I'm really curious about.

Kevin Weil (00:08:48):
Well, it's 1 PM here. It doesn't get dark for a while, so let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:53):
Okay, here we go. Okay, so first of all, I'm just going to take notes here. When is AGI launching? When in December?

Kevin Weil (00:08:58):
I mean, we just launched a good ImageGen model. Does that count?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:03):
It's getting there. It's getting there.

Kevin Weil (00:09:05):
There's this quote I love, which is "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet" because once it's been done, when it kind of works, then you call it machine learning, and once it's kind of ubiquitous and it's everywhere, then it's just an algorithm. So I've always loved that we call things AI when they still don't quite work and then by the time it's like an AI algorithm that's recommending you follow, oh, that's just an algorithm, but this new thing, like self-driving cars, that's it. I think to some degree we're always going to be there and the next thing is always going to be AI and the current thing that we use every day and is just a part of our lives, that's an algorithm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
It's so interesting because in the Bay Area you see self-driving cars driving around and it's so normal now when four years ago and three years ago, you would've seen this and you'd be like, "Holy shit, what is... We're in the future." And now we're just so take it for granted.

Kevin Weil (00:10:01):
I mean there's something like that with everything. If I showed you... When GPT-3 launched, I wasn't at OpenAI then. I was just a user, but it was mind-blowing. And if I gave you GPT-3 now I just plugged that into ChatGPT for you and you started using it, you'd be like, "What is this thing?" It's like mess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):
Flop, flop.

Kevin Weil (00:10:24):
I had the same experience when I first got into a Waymo, your very first ride, at least my very first ride, my first 10 seconds in a Waymo, it starts driving and you're like, "Oh my God, watch out for that bike." You're holding onto whatever you can. And then five minutes in, you've calmed down and you realize that you're getting driven around the city without a driver and it's working. You're just like, "Oh my God, I am living in the future right now." And then another 10 minutes, you're bored, you're doing email on your phone, answering Slack messages, and suddenly this miracle of human invention is just an expected part of your life from then on. And there is really something in the way that we all are adapting to AI that's kind of like that. These miraculous things happen and computers can do something they've never been able to do before and it blows our mind collectively for a week and then we're like, oh, yeah. Oh, now it's just machine learning on its way to being an algorithm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):
The craziest thing about what you just shared actually is, I don't know, ChatGPT, which is now feels terrible. 3.5 was a couple years ago, and imagine what life will be like in a couple years from now. We're going to get to that, where things are going, what you think is going to be the next big leap. But I want to start with the beginning of your journey at OpenAI. So you worked at Twitter, you worked at Facebook, you worked at Planet, Instagram. At some point you got recruited to go and come work at OpenAI. I'm curious just what that story was like of the recruiting process of joining OpenAI as CPO. Is there any fun stories there?

Kevin Weil (00:12:01):
If I'm remembering the timeline right, we communicated at Planet I was leaving and I was planning to just go take some time. I wasn't going to stop working, but I was also happy to take the summer. This was maybe April or something. I was like, cool, I'm going to have the summer with my kids. We're going to go to Tahoe or something and I'll actually get to hang out rather than what I usually do going up and down and all that. And then Sam and I had known each other lightly for a bunch of years and he's always involved in so many interesting things like companies building fusion and all these things. So he'd always been somebody that I would call occasionally if I was starting to think about my next thing because I like working on big tech forward, sort of next wave kind of things.

(00:12:49):
And so I called him and I think Vinod also helped to put us in touch again. And this time it wasn't like, "Oh, you should go talk to these guys working on fusion." He said, "Actually, we're thinking about something, you should come talk to us." I was like, "Okay, that sounds amazing. Let's do it." And it goes really fast, really, really fast. I met most of the management team in a brief period of time, a few days, and they were telling me, 'Look, we're basically going to move as fast as we want to move. And if you talk to everyone, everyone likes you, you're ready to go." Sam came over for dinner and we had a great evening together just talking about OpenAI in the future and getting to know each other better. And at the end I was like, I was going to go in the next day for a bigger round of interviews and Sam was saying, "Hey, it's going really well. We're really excited."

(00:13:52):
And I said, "Cool. So how do I think about tomorrow?" And he said, "Oh, you'll be fine. Don't worry about it. And if it goes well, we're basically there." And so I go in the next day, meet a bunch of people, have a great time. I really enjoyed everybody I met with. In any interview, you can always second guess yourself like, oh, I shouldn't have said that thing or that thing I gave a bad answer on I wish I could redo, but I came away feeling like I think that went pretty well. And I was expecting to hear that weekend basically because they sort of set expectations as soon as if this goes well, we're ready to go. And I didn't hear anything. And then it was like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I still didn't hear anything and I reached out to folks on the OpenAI side a couple of times, still nothing.

(00:14:45):
And I was like, "Oh my God, I screwed it up. I don't know where I screwed it up, but I totally screwed it up. I can't believe it." And I was going back to Elizabeth, my wife and being like, "What did I do? Where do you think I..." Getting all crazy about it and then it's still nothing. And finally it was like nine days later, they finally got back to me and it turned out there was a bunch of stuff happening internally and this, that and the other thing, and there's just a million things happening. And they finally were like, "Oh yeah, that went well. Let's do this." And I was like, "Oh, okay, cool, let's do it." But it was nine days of agony and they were just super busy on some internal stuff and there I was fretting every single day and re-going over every line of our interview process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):
It makes me think about when you're dating someone and you've texted them and you're not hearing anything back, you assume something is wrong.

Kevin Weil (00:15:40):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:41):
They might just be busy.

Kevin Weil (00:15:42):
I have a hard time about it still.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:47):
That's wild. I love that it worked out. And I guess the lesson there is don't jump to conclusions.

Kevin Weil (00:15:55):
Yeah. Have a little bit of chill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:59):
Speaking of that, I want to chat about what it's just like to be inside the center of the storm. Again, you work at a lot of, let's say traditional companies even though they're not that traditional, Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and Planet, and now you work at OpenAI. I'm curious, what is most different about how things work in your day-to-day life at OpenAI?

Kevin Weil (00:16:19):
I think it's probably the pace. Maybe it's two things. One is it's the pace. The second is everywhere I've ever worked before this, you kind of know what technology you're building on. So you spend your time thinking about what problems are you solving? Who are you building for? How are you going to make their lives better? How are you going to... Is this a big enough problem that you're going to be able to change habits? Do people care about this problem being solved? All those good product things. But the stuff that you're building on is kind of fixed. You're talking about databases and things and I bet the database you used this year is probably 5% better than the database you used two years ago, but that's not true at all with AI. It's like every two months computers can do something they've never been able to do before and you need to completely think differently about what you're doing.

(00:17:10):
There's something fundamentally interesting about that makes life fun here. There's also something we will maybe talk about evals later, but it also really, in this world of... Everything we're used to with computers is about giving a computer very defined inputs. If you look at Instagram for example, there are buttons that do specific things and you know what they do. And then when you give a computer defined inputs, you get very defined outputs. You're confident that if you do the same thing three times, you're going to get the same output three times. LLMs are completely different than that. They're good at fuzzy subtle inputs. Then all the nuances of human language and communication, they're pretty good at. And also they don't really give you the same answer. You probably get spiritually the same answer for the same question, but it's certainly not the same set of words every time. And so you're much more, it's fuzzier inputs and fuzzier outputs. And when you're building products, it really matters whether there's some use case that you're trying to build around.

(00:18:16):
If the model gets it right 60% of the time, you build a very different product than if the model gets it right 95% of the time versus if the model gets it right 99.5% of the time. And so there's also something that you have to get really into the weeds on your use case and the evals and things like that in order to understand the right kind of product to build. So that is just fundamentally different. If your database works once, it works every time. And that's not true in this world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
Let's actually follow this thread on evals. I definitely wanted to talk about this. We had this legendary panel at the Lenny & Friends Summit. It was you and Mike Krieger and Sarah Guo moderating.

Kevin Weil (00:18:58):
That was fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
So fun. The thing that I heard that kind of stuck with people from that panel was a comment you made where you said that writing evals is going to become a core skill for product managers, and I feel like that probably applies further than just product managers. A lot of people know what evals are. A lot of people have no idea what I'm talking about. So could you just briefly explain what is an eval and then just why do you think this is going to be so important for people building products in the future?

Kevin Weil (00:19:23):
Yeah, sure. I think the easiest way to think about it is almost like a quiz for a model, a test to gauge how well it knows a certain set of subject material or how good it is at responding to a certain set of questions. So in the same way you take a calculus class and then you have calculus tests that see if you've learned what you're supposed to learn. You have evals that test how good is the model at creative writing? How good is the model at graduate level science? How good is the model at competitive coding? And so you have these set of evals that basically perform as benchmarks for how smart or capable the model is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:04):
Is it a simple way to think about it, like unit tests for model?

Kevin Weil (00:20:07):
Yeah, unit tests, tests in general for models. Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:10):
Great, great. Okay. And then why is this so important for people that don't totally understand what the hell's going on here with evals? Why is this so key to building AI products?

Kevin Weil (00:20:20):
Well, it gets back to what I was saying. You need to know whether your model is going to... There are certain things that models will get right. 99.95% of the time and you can just be confident. There are things that they're going to be 95% right on and things they're going to be 60% right on. If the model's 60% right on something, you're going to need to build your product totally differently. And by the way, these things aren't static either. So a big part of evals is if you know you're building for some use case. So let's take our deep research product, which is one of my favorite things that we've released maybe ever. The idea is with deep research for people who haven't used it, you can give ChatGPT now an arbitrarily complex query. It's not about returning you an answer from a search query, which we can also do.

(00:21:10):
It's here's a thing that if you were going to answer it yourself, you'd go off and do two hours of reading on the web and then you might need to read some papers and then you would come back and start writing up your thoughts and realize you had some gaps in your thinking. So you go out and do more research. It might take you a week to write some 20 page answer to this question. You can let ChatGPT just like chug for you for 25, 30 minutes. It's not the immediate answers you're used to, but it might go work for 25, 30 minutes and do work that would've taken you a week. So as we were building that product, we were designing evals at the same time as we were thinking about how this product was going to work and we were trying to go through hero use cases.

(00:21:57):
Here's a question you want to be able to ask. Here's an amazing answer for that question. And then turning those into evals and then hill climbing on those evals. So it's not just that the model is static and we hope it does okay on a certain set of things, you can teach the model. You can make this a continuous learning process. And so as we were fine-tuning our model for deep research to be able to answer these things, we were able to test is it getting better on these evals that we said were important measures of how the product was working? And it's when you start seeing that and you start seeing performance on evals going up, you start saying, "Okay, I think we have a product here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):
You made a kind of a comment along these same lines around evals that AI is almost capped in how amazing it can be by how good we are at evals. Does that resonate? Any more thoughts along those lines?

Kevin Weil (00:22:48):
I mean, these models are their intelligences and intelligence is so fundamentally multidimensional so you can talk about a model being amazing at competitive coding, which may not be the same as that model being great at front-end coding-

Kevin Weil (00:23:00):
... may not be the same as that model being great at front-end coding or back-end coding or taking a whole bunch of code that's written in COBOL and turning it into Python. And that's just within the software engineering world. So I think there's a sense in which you can think of these models as incredibly smart, very factually aware intelligences, but still most of the world's data, knowledge, process is not public. It's behind the walls of companies or governments or other things. And same way, if you were going to join a company, you would spend your first two weeks onboarding. You'd be learning the company-specific processes. You'd get access to company-specific data. The models are smart enough, you can teach them anything, but they need to have the raw data to learn from.

(00:23:58):
So there's a sense in which I think the future is really going to be incredibly smart, broad-based models that are fine-tuned and tailored with company-specific or use case-specific data so that they perform really well on company-specific, or use case-specific things. And you're going to measure that with custom evals. So what I was referring to is just like these models are really smart, you need to still teach them things if the data's not in their training set, and there's a huge amount of use cases that are not going to be in their training set because they're relevant to one industry or one company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):
I'm just going to keep following the thread that you're leading us down, but I'm going to come back because I have more questions around some of these things. So you came to a space that I think a lot of AI founders are thinking about is just, where's OpenAI not going to come squash me in the future? Or one of the other foundational models. So it's unclear to a lot of people just like, "Should I build a startup in this space or not?" Is there any advice you have or any guidance for where you think OpenAI, or just foundational models in general likely won't go and where you have an opportunity to build a company?

Kevin Weil (00:25:10):
So this is something that Ev Williams used to say back at Twitter that's always stuck with me, which is, "No matter how big your company gets, no matter how incredible the people are, there are way more smart people outside your walls than there are inside your walls." And that's why we are so focused on building a great API. We have 3 million developers using our API. No matter how ambitious we are, how big we grow, by the way, we don't want to grow super big, there are so many use cases, places in the world where AI can fundamentally make our lives better. We're not going to have the people. We're not going to have the know-how to build most of these things.

(00:25:55):
And I think, like I was saying, the data is industry-specific, use case-specific, behind certain company walls, things like that. And there are immense opportunities in every industry and every vertical in the world to go build AI-based products that improve upon the state of the art. And there's just no way we could ever do that ourselves. We don't want to. We if we did want to, and we're really excited to power that for 3 million-plus developers and way more in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):
Coming back to your earlier point about the tech changing constantly and getting faster, not exactly knowing what you'll have by the time you launch something in terms of the power, the model. I'm curious what allows you to ship quickly and consistently in such great stuff? And it sounds like one answer is bottoms-up empowered teams versus a very top-down roadmap that's planned out for a quarter. What are some of those things that allow you to ship such great stuff so often, so quickly?

Kevin Weil (00:26:53):
Yeah. I mean, we try and have a sense of where we're trying to go, point ourselves in a direction so that we have some rough sense of alignment. Thematically, I don't for second, and we do quarterly roadmapping. We laid out a year-long strategy. I don't for a second believe that what we write down in these documents is what we're going to actually ship three months from now, let alone six or nine. But that's okay. I think it's like an Eisenhower quote, "Plans are useless. Planning is helpful," which I totally subscribe to, especially in this world. It's really valuable. If you think about quarterly road roadmapping for example, it's really valuable to have a moment where you stop and go, "Okay. What did we do? What worked? What went well? What didn't go well? What did we learn and now what do we think we're going to do next?"

(00:27:44):
And by the way, everybody has some dependencies. You need the infrastructure team to do the following things, partnership with research here. So you want to have a second to check your dependencies, make sure you're good to go and then start executing. We try and keep that really lightweight because it's not going to be right. We're going to throw it out halfway because we will have learned new things. So the moment of planning is helpful even if it's only partially.

(00:28:12):
So I think just expecting that you're going to be super agile and that there's no sense writing a three month roadmap, let alone a year long roadmap because the technology's changing underneath you so quickly. We really do try and go very strongly bottoms up, subject to our overall directional alignment. We have great people. We have engineers and PMs and designers and researchers who are passionate about the products they're building and have strong opinions about them and are also the ones building them. So they have a real sense of what the capabilities are too, which is super important.

(00:28:49):
So I think you want to be more bottoms up in this way. So we operate that way. We are happy making mistakes. We make mistakes all the time. It's one of the things I really appreciate about Sam. He pushes us really hard to move fast, but he also understands that with moving fast comes, we didn't quite get this right or that we launched this thing, it didn't work. We'll roll it back. Look at our naming. Our naming is horrible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
That was a lot of questions people had for you. Model names, yeah.

Kevin Weil (00:29:18):
It's absolutely atrocious and we know it, and we will get around to fixing it at some point, but it's not the most important thing and so we don't spend a lot of time on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):
But it also shows you how it doesn't matter. Again, ChatGPT the most popular, fastest growing product in history, it's the number one AI, API and model. So clearly it doesn't matter that much.

Kevin Weil (00:29:39):
And we name things like o3 mini high.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):
Man, I love it. Okay. So you talked about roadmapping and bottoms up and I'm really curious, is there a cadence or a ritual of aligning with you or Sam or you review everything that's going out? Is there a meeting every week or every month where you guys see what's happening?

Kevin Weil (00:30:03):
On key projects. So we do product reviews and things like that, like you would expect. There isn't a ritual because there isn't... I would never want us to be blocked on launching something, waiting for a review with me or Sam, if we can't get there. If I'm traveling or Sam's busy or whatever, that's a bad reason for us not to ship. So obviously for the biggest, most high priority stuff, we have a pretty close beat on it, but we really try not to, frankly. We want to empower teams to move quickly, and I think it's more important to ship and iterate.

(00:30:42):
So we have this philosophy, we call iterative deployment, and the idea is we're all learning about these models together. So there's a real sense in which it's way better to ship something even when you don't know the full set of capabilities and iterate together in public. And we co-evolve together with the rest of society as we learn about these things and where they're different and where they're good and bad and weird. I really like that philosophy.

(00:31:12):
I think the other thing that ends up being a part of our product philosophy is the sense of model maximalism. The models are not perfect. They're going to make mistakes. You could spend a lot of time building all kinds of different scaffolding around them. And by the way, sometimes we do because sometimes there are kinds of errors that you just don't want to make, but we don't spend that much time building scaffolding around the parts that don't match that because our general mindset is in two months there's going to be a better model and it's going to blow away whatever the current set of limitations are.

(00:31:52):
So if you're building, and we say this to developers too, if you're building and the product that you're building is right on the edge of the capabilities of the models, keep going, because you're doing something right because you give it another couple months and the models are going to be great, and suddenly the product that you have that just barely worked is really going to sing. And that's how you make sure that you're really pushing the envelope and building new things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
I had the founder of Bolt on the podcast, StackBlitz is the company name, and he shared this story that they've been working on this product for seven years behind the scenes and it was failing. Nothing was happening. And then all of a sudden it was, sorry to mention a competitor, but Claude came out or a Sonnet 3.5 came out and all of a sudden everything worked and they've been building all this time and finally it worked. And I hear that a lot with YC, just like things that never were possible now are just becoming possible every few months with the updates to the models.

Kevin Weil (00:32:48):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
Let me actually ask this, I wasn't planning to ask this, but I'm curious if you have any quick thoughts just why is Sonnet so good at coding, and thoughts on your stuff getting as good and better at actual coding?

Kevin Weil (00:33:01):
Yeah. I mean, kudos to Anthropic. They've built very good coding models. No doubt. We think that we can do the same. Maybe by the time this podcast has shipped, we'll have more to say, but either way, all credit to them. I think intelligence is really multi-dimensional and so I think the model providers... It used to be that OpenAI had this massive model lead, 12 months or something ahead of everybody else. That's not true anymore. I like to think we still have a lead. I'd argue that we do, but it's certainly not a massive one. And that means that there are going to be different places where the Google models are really good or where Anthropic models are really good, or where we're really good and our competitors are like, "We got to get better at that." And it actually is easier to get better at a certain thing once someone's proved it possible than it is to forge a path through the jungle and doing something brand new.

(00:34:03):
So I just think as an example, it was like nobody could break 4 minutes in the mile, and then finally somebody did and the next year 12 more people did it. I think there's that all over the place and it just means that competition is really intense, and consumers are going to win and developers are going to win and businesses are going to win in a big way from that. It's part of why the industry moves so fast, but all respect to the other big model providers. Models are getting really good. We're going to move as fast as we can and I think we've got some good stuff coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:36):
Exciting. This makes me also think about, in many ways other models are better at certain things, but somehow ChatGPT is the... If you look at all the awareness numbers and usage numbers, it's like no matter where you guys are in the rankings, people seem to just think of AI ChatGPT almost as the same. What do you think you did right to win in the consumer mindset, at least at this point and awareness in the world?

Kevin Weil (00:35:02):
I think being first helps, which is one of the reasons why we're so focused on moving quickly. We like being the first to launch new capabilities. Things like deep research. Our models, they can do a lot of things. So they can take real-time video input, you have speech to speech, you can do speech to text and text to speech. They can do deep research. They can operate on a canvas, they can write code. So ChatGPT can be this one- stop-shop where all the things that you want to do are possible. And as we go forward in it, we have more agentic tools like Operator where it's browsing for you and doing things for you on the web, more and more you're going to be able to come to this one place to ChatGPT, give it instructions and have it accomplish real things for you in the world. There's something fundamentally valuable in that. So we think a lot about that. We try to move really fast so that we are always the most useful place for people to come to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:04):
What would you say is the most counterintuitive thing that you've learned after building AI products or working at OpenAI, something that's just like, "I did not expect that?"

Kevin Weil (00:36:14):
I don't know, maybe I should have expected this, but one of the things that's been funny for me is the extent to which you're trying to figure out how some product should work with AI, or even why some AI thing happens to be true, you can often reason about it the way you would reason about another human and it works. So maybe a couple examples. When we were first launching our reasoning model, we were the first to build a model that could reason, that could, instead of giving you just a quick system one answer right away to every question you asked, it was the third Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, here's an answer.

(00:36:59):
You could ask it hard questions and it would reason. The same way that if I asked you to do a crossword puzzle, you couldn't just snap fill in everything. You would be, "Well, okay. On this one across, I think it could be one of these two, but that means there's an A here. So that one has to be this, away, back track, step-by-step build up from where you are." Same way you answer any difficult logistical problem, any scientific problem. So this reasoning breakthrough was big, but it was also the first time that a model needed to sit and think. And that's a weird paradigm for a consumer product. You don't normally have something where you might need to hang out for 25 seconds after you ask a question.

(00:37:40):
So we were trying to figure out what's the UI for this? With deep research where the model's going to go and think for 25 minutes sometimes, it's actually not that hard because you're not going to sit and watch it for 25 minutes. You're going to go do something else. You're going to go to another tab or go get lunch or whatever, and then you'll come back and it's done when it's like 20, 25 seconds or 10 seconds, it's a long time to wait, but it's not long enough to go to do something else.

(00:38:09):
So you can think, if you asked me something that I needed to think for 20 seconds to answer, what would I do? I wouldn't just go mute and not say anything and shut down for 20 seconds and then come back. So we shouldn't do that. We shouldn't just have a slider sitting there. That's annoying. But I also wouldn't just start babbling every single thought that I had. So we probably shouldn't just expose the whole chain of thought as the model's thinking, but I might go like, "That's a good question. All right." I might approach it like that and then think. You're maybe giving little updates and that's actually what we ended up shipping.

(00:38:49):
You have similar things where you can find situations where you get better thinking sometimes out of a group of models that all try and attack the same problem, and then you have a model that's looking at all their outputs and integrating it and then giving you a single answer at the end. I mean, sounds a little bit like brainstorming. I certainly have better ideas when I get in a room and brainstorm with other people because they think differently than me. So anyways, there's just all these situations where you can actually reason about it like a group of humans or an individual human and it works, which I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised but I was.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):
That is so interesting because when I see these models operate, I never even thought about you guys designing that experience. To me, it just feels like this is what the LLM does. It just sits there and tells me what it's thinking. And I love this point you're making of let's make it feel like a human operating and well, how does a human operate? Well, they just talk aloud. They think, here's the thing I should explore. And I love that deep sequence to the extreme of that where they're just like, "Here's everything I'm doing and thinking." And people actually like that too, I guess. Was that surprising to you, "Maybe that could work too. People seem to like everything?"

Kevin Weil (00:40:02):
Yeah. We learned from that actually because when we first launched it, we gave you the subheadings of what the model was thinking about, but not much more. And then deep seek launched and it was a lot and we went, I don't know if everyone wants that. There's some novelty effect to seeing what the model's really thinking about. We felt that too when we were looking at it internally. It's interesting to see the model's chain of thought, but it's not... I think at the scale of 400 million people, you don't want to see the model babble a bunch of things.

(00:40:34):
So what we ended up doing was summarizing it in interesting ways. So instead of just getting the subheadings, you're getting one or two sentences about how it's thinking about it and you can learn from that. So we tried to find a middle ground that we thought was an experience would be meaningful for most people, but showing everybody three paragraphs is probably not the right answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:57):
This reminds me of something else you said at the summit that has really stuck with me, this idea that chat, people always make fun of chat is not the future interface for how we interact with AI, but you made this really interesting point that may argue the other side, which is, as humans we interface by talking and the IQ of a human can span from really low to really high and it all works talking to them and chat is the same thing and it can work on all kinds of intelligence levels. Maybe I just shared it, but I guess anything there about just why chat actually ends up being such an interesting interface for LLMs?

Kevin Weil (00:41:30):
Yeah. I don't know, maybe this is one of those things I believe that most people don't believe, but I actually think chat is an amazing interface because it's so versatile. People tend to go, "Chat. Yeah. We'll figure out something better." And I think it's incredibly universal because it is the way we talk. I can talk to you verbally like we're talking now. We can see each other and interact. We can talk on WhatsApp and be texting each other, but all of these things is this unstructured method of communication and that's how we operate.

(00:42:12):
If I had some more rigid interface that I was allowed to use when we spoke, I would be able to speak to you about far fewer things and it would actually get in the way of us having maximum communication bandwidth. So there's something magical. And by the way, in the past it never worked because there wasn't a model that was good at understanding all of the complexity and nuances of human speech, and that's the magic of LLMs. So to me, it's like an interface that's exactly fit to the power of these things. And that doesn't mean that it always has to be just like I don't necessarily always want to type, but you do want that very open-ended, flexible communication medium, it may be that we're speaking and the model's speaking back to me, but you still want the very lowest common denominator, no restrictions way of interacting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
That is so interesting. That's really changed the way I think about this stuff is that point that chat is just so good for this very specific problem of talking to superintelligence basically.

Kevin Weil (00:43:13):
By the way, I think it's not that it's only chat either. If you have high volume use cases where they're more prescribed and you don't actually need the full generality, there are many use cases where it's better to have something that's less flexible, more prescribed, faster to specific task, and those are great too, and you can build all sorts of those. But you still want chat as this baseline for anything that falls out of whatever vertical you happen to be building for. It's like a catch-all for every possible thing you'd ever want to express to a model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:51):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long-time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:43:58):
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:00):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs?

Christina Gilbert (00:44:15):
Yes. So we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead, use something like OneSchema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:44:49):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers, and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:45:23):
I want to come back to that you talked about researchers and their relationship with product teams. I imagine a lot of innovation comes from researchers just like having an inkling and then building something amazing and then releasing it, and some ideas come from PMs and engineers. How do those teams collaborate? Does every team have a PM? Is it a lot of research-led stuff? Give us a sense of just where ideas and products come from mostly.

Kevin Weil (00:45:49):
It's an area where we're evolving a lot. I'm really excited about it, frankly. I think if you go back a couple of years when ChatGPT was just getting started, obviously, I wasn't in OpenAI, but...

Kevin Weil (00:46:00):
Obviously I wasn't an Open AI, but... We were more of a pure research company at the time. Chat GPT, if you remember, was a low-key research preview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:14):
For many years.

Kevin Weil (00:46:15):
Yeah. It wasn't a thing that the team launched thinking it was going to be this massive product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:19):
Oh, Chat GPT. Yeah.

Kevin Weil (00:46:21):
And it was just a way that we were going to let people play with and iterate on the models. So we were primarily a research company, a world-class research company, and as ChatGPT has grown and as we've built our B-to-B products and our APIs and other things, now we're more of a product company than we were. I still think we can't... Open AI should never be a pure product company. We need to be both a world-class research company and a world-class product company, and the two need to really work together, and that's the thing that I think we've been getting much better at over the last six months. If you treat those things separately and the researchers go do amazing things and build models and then they get to some state and then the product and engineering teams go take them and do something with them, we're effectively just an API consumer of our own models.

(00:47:17):
The best products though are going to be, it's like I was talking about with deep research, it's a lot of iterative feedback. It's understanding the products you're trying to sell or the problems you're trying to solve, building evals for them, using those evals to go gather data and fine-tune models to get them to be better at these use cases that you're looking to solve. It's a huge amount of back and forth to do it well. And I think the best products are going to be ENG product design and research working together as a single team to build novel things. So that's actually how we're trying to operate with basically anything that we build. It's a new muscle for us because we're kind of new as a product company, but it's one that people are really excited about because we've seen every time we do it, we build something awesome, and so now every product starts like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:07):
How many product managers do you have at Open AI? I don't know if you share that number, but if you do.

Kevin Weil (00:48:11):
Not that many, actually. I don't know, 25. Maybe it's a little more than that. My personal belief is that you want to be pretty PM light as an organization just in general. I say this with love because I am a PM, but too many PMs causes problems. We'll fill the world with decks and ideas versus execution. So I think it's a good thing when you have a PM that is working with maybe slightly too many engineers because it means they're not going to get in and micromanage. You're going to leave a lot of influence and responsibility with the engineers to make decisions. It means you want to have really product-focused engineers, which we're fortunate to have. We have an amazingly product focused, high agency engineering team. But when you have something like that, you have a team that feels super empowered, you have a PM that's trying to really understand the problems and gently guide the team a little bit but has too much going on to get too far into the details, and you end up being able to move really fast. So that's kind of the philosophy we take.

(00:49:23):
We want Product ENG leads and product engineers all the way through. We want not too many PMs, but really awesome, high quality ones, and so far that seems to be working pretty well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:36):
I imagine being a PM at Open AI is a dream come true for a lot of people. At the same time, I imagine it's not a fit for a lot of people. There's researchers involved, very product minded engineers. What do you look for in the PMs that you hire there for folks that are like, "Maybe I shouldn't go work there. I shouldn't even think about that."

Kevin Weil (00:49:54):
I think, I've said this a few times, but high agency is something that we really look for, people that are not going to come in and wait for everyone else to allow them to do something, they're just going to see a problem and go do it. It's just a core part of how we work. I think people that are happy with ambiguity, because there is a massive amount of ambiguity here, it is not the kind of place, and we have trouble sometimes with more junior PMs because of this, because it's just not the place where someone is going to come in and say, "Okay, here's the landscape, here's your area, I want you to go do this thing." And that's what you want as an early career PM. I mean, no one here has time and the problems are too ill-formed and we're figuring them all out as we go. And so high agency, very comfortable with ambiguity, ready to come in and help execute and move really quickly. That's kind of our recipe.

(00:50:55):
And I think also happy leading through influence because... I mean it's usual as a PM, people don't report to you, your team doesn't report to you, et cetera, but you also have the complexity of a research function, which is even more sort of self-directed and it's really important to build a good rapport with the research team. I think the EQ side of things is also super important for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):
I know at most companies, a PM comes in and they're just like, "Why do we need you?" And as a PM you have to earn trust and help people see the value, and I feel like at Open AI it's probably a very extreme version of that where they're like, "Why do we need this person? We have researchers, engineers, what are you going to do here?"

Kevin Weil (00:51:40):
Yeah, I think people appreciate it done right, but you bring people along. I think one of the most important things a PM can do well is be decisive. So there's a real fine line. You don't want to be making... I mean it's kind of like, I don't love the PM as the CEO of the product illusion all the time, but just like Sam in his role would be making mistakes if he made every single decision in every meeting that he was in. And he would also be making mistakes if he made no decisions in any meetings that he was in, right? It's understanding when to defer to your team and to let people innovate. And when there is a decision to be made that people either don't feel comfortable with or don't feel empowered to make, or a decision that has too many different disparate pros and cons that are spread out across a big group and someone needs to be decisive and make a call, it's a really important trait of a CEO.

(00:52:41):
It's something Sam does well, and it's also a really important trait of a PM kind of at a more microscopic level. So because there's so much ambiguity, it's not obvious what the answer is in a lot of cases, and so having a PM that can come in and... And by the way, this doesn't need to be a PM, I'm perfectly happy if it's anybody else, but I kind of look to the PM to say, if there's ambiguity and no one's making a call, you better make sure that we get a call made and we move forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):
This touches on a few posts I've done of just, where is AI going to take over work that we do versus help us with various work? So let me come at this question from a different direction of just how AI impacts product teams and hiring, things like that. So first of all, there's all this talk of LM's doing our coding for us, and 90% of code is going to be written by AI in a year. Dario at Anthropic said that. At the same time, you guys are all hiring engineers like crazy, PM's like crazy. Every function is dead, but you're still hiring every single one. I guess just, first of all, let me just ask this, how do you and the team, say engineers, PMs, use AI in your work? Is there anything that's really interesting or things that you think people are sleeping on in how you use AI in your day-to-day work?

Kevin Weil (00:53:52):
We use it a lot. I mean, every one of us is in Chat GPT all the time summarizing docs, using it to help write docs with GPTs that write product specs and things like that, all the stuff that you would imagine. I mean talk about writing evals, you can actually use models to help you write evals and they're pretty good at it. That all said, I'm still sort of disappointed by us, and I really mean me, in, if I were to just teleport my five-year-old self leading product at some other company into my day job, I would recognize it still. And I think we should be in a world, certainly a year from now, probably even more now, where I almost wouldn't recognize it because the workflows are so different and I'm using AI so heavily, and I'd still recognize it today. So I think in some sense, I'm not doing a good enough job of that.

(00:54:46):
Just to give an example, why shouldn't we be vibe coding demos right, left and center? Instead of showing stuff in Figma, we should be showing prototypes that people are vibe coding over the course of 30 minutes to illustrate proofs of concept and to explore ideas. That's totally possible today, and we're not doing it enough. Actually, our chief people officer, Julia, was telling me the other day, she vibe coded an internal tool that she had at a previous job that she really wanted to have here at Open AI and she opened, I don't know, Windsurf or something, and vibe coded it. How cool is that? And if our chief people officer is doing it, we have no excuse to not be doing it more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:34):
That's an awesome story. And some people may not have heard this term vibe coding. Can you describe what that means?

Kevin Weil (00:55:40):
Yeah, I think this was Andrej's term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:45):
Karpathy. Yeah.

Kevin Weil (00:55:46):
Andrej Karpathy. Yeah. So you have these tools like Cursor and Windsurf and GitHub Copilot that are very good at suggesting what code you might want to write. So you can give them a prompt and they'll write code and then as you go to edit it, it's suggesting what you might want to do. And the way that everyone started using that stuff was, give it a prompt, have it do stuff, you go edit it, give it a prompt, and you're kind of really going back and forth with the model the whole time. As the models are getting better and as people are getting more used to it, you can kind of just let go of the wheel a little bit. And when the model's suggesting stuff, it's just like, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Keep going. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(00:56:29):
And of course the model makes mistakes or it does something that doesn't compile, but when it doesn't compile, you paste the error in and you say, go, go, go, go, go. And then you test it out and it does one thing that you don't want it to do, so you enter in an instruction and say, go, go, go, go, go, and you just let the model do its thing. And it's not that you would do that for production code that needed to be super tight today yet, but for so many things, you're trying to get to a proof of concept, you're getting to a demo and you can really take your hands off the wheel and the model will do an amazing job, and that's vibe coding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:05):
That's an awesome explanation. I think the pro version of that, which is, I think, the way Andre even described it as you talk, there's a step like whisper or super whisper or something like that where you're talking to the model, not even typing.

Kevin Weil (00:57:17):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:19):
Oh man. So let me just ask, I guess, when you look at product teams in the future, you talked about how you guys should be doing this more, instead of designs, having prototypes, what do you think might be the biggest changes in how product teams are structured or built? Where do you think things are going in the next few years?

Kevin Weil (00:57:36):
I think you're definitely going to live in a world where you have researchers built into every product team. And I don't even mean just at foundation model companies because I think the future... Actually, frankly one thing that I'm sort of surprised about about our industry in general is that there's not a greater use of fine-tuned models. A lot of people... These models are very good, so our API does a lot of things really well, but when you have particular use cases, you can always make the model perform better on a particular use case by fine-tuning it. It's probably just a matter of time. Folks aren't quite comfortable yet with doing that in every case. But to me, there's no question that that's the future. Models are going to be everywhere just like transistors are everywhere, AI is going to be just a part of the fabric of everything we do, but I think there are going to be a lot of fine-tuned models because why would you not want to more specifically customize a model against a particular use case?

(00:58:37):
And so I think you're going to want sort of quasi researcher machine learning engineer types as part of pretty much every team because fine-tuning a model is just going to be part of the core workflow for building most products. So that's one change that maybe you're starting to see at foundation model companies that will propagate out to more teams over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):
I'm curious if there's a concrete example that makes that real, and I'll share one that comes to mind as you talk, which is, when you look at Cursor and Windsurf, something I learned from those founders is that they use a Sonnet, but then they also have a bunch of custom models that help along the edges that make the specific experience that's not just generating code even better like auto-complete and looking ahead to where things are going. So is that one or any other examples of which you... What is a fine-tuned model? Do you think teams will be building with these researchers on their teams?

Kevin Weil (00:59:29):
Yeah. I mean, so when you're a model, you're basically giving the model a bunch of examples of the kinds of things you want it to be better at. So it's, "Here's a problem, here's a good answer. Here's a problem, here's a good answer," Or, "Here's a question, here's a good answer times a thousand or 10,000." And suddenly you're teaching the model to be much better than it was out of the gate at that particular thing. We use it everywhere internally. We use ensembles of models much more internally than people might think. So it's not, "I have 10 different problems. I'll just ask baseline GPT four oh about a bunch of these things." If we have 10 different problems, we might solve them using 20 different model calls, some of which are using specialized fine-tuned models, they're using models of different sizes because maybe you have different latency requirements or cost requirements for different questions.

(01:00:32):
They are probably using custom prompts for each one. Basically you want to teach the model to be really good at... You want to break the problem down into more specific tasks versus some broader set of high level tasks. And then you can use models very specifically to get very good at each individual thing. And then you have an ensemble that tackles the whole thing. I think a lot of good companies are doing that today. I still see a lot of companies giving the model single, generic, broad problems versus breaking the problem down, and I think there will be more breaking the problem down using specific models for specific things, including fine tuning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):
And so in your case, because this is really interesting, is that you're using different levels of Chat GPT, like a 1 0 3 and stuff that's earlier because it's cheaper.

Kevin Weil (01:01:24):
There'll be parts of our internal stack. I'll give you an example. Customer support, with 400 plus million weekly active users, we get a lot of inbound tickets. I don't know how many customer support folks we have, but it's not very many, 30, 40, I'm not sure, way smaller than you would have at any comparable company, and it's because we've automated a lot of our flows. We've got most questions using our internal resources, knowledge base, guidelines for how we answer questions, what kind of personality, et cetera. You can teach the model those things and then have it do a lot of its answers automatically, or where it doesn't have the full confidence to answer a particular question, it can still suggest an answer, request a human to look at it and then that human's answer actually is its own sort of fine tuning data for the model. You're telling it the right answer in a particular case.

(01:02:29):
We're using... At various places. Some of these places, you want a little bit more reasoning, is not super latency sensitive, so you want a little more reasoning, and we'll use one of our O series models. In other places, you want a quick check on something and so you're fine to use four oh mini, which is super fast and super cheap. In general, it's like specific models for specific purposes and then you ensemble them together to solve problems. By the way, again, not unlike how we as humans solve problems, a company is arguably an ensemble of models that have all been fine tuned based on what we studied in college and what we have learned over the course of our careers. We've all been fine tuned to have different sets of skills and you group them together in different configurations and the output of the ensemble is much better than the output of any one individual.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:20):
Kevin, you're blowing my mind. That sounds exactly correct. And also, different people, you pay them less, they cost less to talk to, some people take a long time to answer, some people hallucinating. This is...

Kevin Weil (01:03:38):
I'm telling you. This is a mental model but really does work in thinking...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):
Oh, right. Yeah. This is great. Some people are visual, they want to dry out their thinking, some people want to talk word cell. Wow, this is a really good metaphor. So again, coming back to your advice here because I love that we circled back to it, you're finding a really good way to think about how to design great AI experiences and LMs, I guess, specifically is think about how a person would do this.

Kevin Weil (01:04:01):
Well, it's maybe not always the answer is to think about how a person would do it, but sometimes to gain intuition for how you might solve a problem, you think about what an equivalent human would do in those situations and use that to at least gain a different perspective on the problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):
Wow, this is great.

Kevin Weil (01:04:22):
Because some of this really is talking to a model. There's a lot of prior art because we talk to other humans all the time and encounter them in all sorts of different situations, and so there's a lot to learn from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):
Okay, so speaking of humans, I want to chat about the future a little bit. So you have three kids, and a community member asked me this hilarious question that I think it's something a lot of people are thinking about. So this is Patrick [inaudible 01:04:47]. I worked with him at Airbnb. He says ask what he's encouraging his kids to learn to prepare for the future. I'm worried my 6-year-old by the year 2036 will face a lot of competition trying to get into the top roofing or plumbing programs and need a backup plan.

Kevin Weil (01:05:02):
That's funny. So our kids, we have a 10 year old and eight year old twins, so they're still pretty young. It's amazing how AI native they are. It's completely normal to them that there are self-driving cars. That they can talk to AI all day long. They have full conversations with Chat GPT and Alexa and everything else. I don't know, who knows what the future holds? I think things like coding skills are going to be relevant for a long time, who knows? But I think if you teach your kids to be curious, to be independent, to be self-confident, you teach them how to think, I don't know what the future holds, but I think that those are going to be skills that are going to be important in any configuration of the future. And so it's not like we have all the answers, but that's how Elizabeth and I think about our kids.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:02):
And do you find that AI... There's a lot of talk about AI tutoring. Is that something you guys are doing? I know they're using Chat GPT, I love all the photos you post where they're playing with prompts and stuff, but I guess is there anything there you're experimenting with or you think is going to become really important?

Kevin Weil (01:06:16):
This is something that... It's maybe the most important thing that AI could do. Maybe that's a grand statement. There are lots of important things that AI can do, including speeding up the pace of fundamental science research and discovery, which maybe is actually the most important thing AI can do. But one of the most important things would be personalized tutoring. And it kind of blows my mind that there is still... I know there are a bunch of good products out there. Khan Academy does great things. They're a wonderful partner of ours. Vinod Khosla has a non-profit that's doing some really interesting stuff in this space and is making an impact. But I'm kind of surprised that there isn't a 2 billion kid AI personalized tutoring thing because the models are good enough to do it now, and every study out there that's ever been done seems to show that when you have... Like, education is still important, but when you combine that with personalized tutoring, you get multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed.

(01:07:31):
And so it's uncontroversial, it's good for kids, it's free. Chat GPT is free, you don't need to pay, and the models are good enough. It still just kind of blows my mind that there isn't something amazing out there that our kids are using and your future kids are using, and people in all sorts of places around the world that aren't as lucky as our kids to be able to have this sort of built-in, solid education. Again, Chat GPT is free. People have Android devices everywhere. I really just think this could change the world and I'm surprised it doesn't exist and I want it to exist.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:08):
This kind of touches on something I want to spend a little time on, which is a lot of people also worry a lot about AI, where it's going, they worry about jobs it's going to take, they worry about the super intelligence squashing humanity in the future. What's your perspective on that and just the optimistic case that I think people need to hear?

Kevin Weil (01:08:27):
I mean, I'm a big technology optimist. I think if you look over the last 200 years, maybe more, technology has driven a lot of the advancements that have made us the world and the society that we are today. It drives economic advancements, it drives geopolitical advancements, quality of life, longevity advancement. I mean, technology's at the root of just about everything, so I think there are very few examples where this is anything but a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't...

Kevin Weil (01:09:00):
... a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't temporary dislocations or where there aren't individuals that are impacted, and that matters too. So it can't just be that the average is good. You've got to also think about how you take care of each individual person as best you can.

(01:09:18):
It is something that we think a lot about and as we work with the administration, as we work with policy, we try and help wherever we can. We do a lot with education. One of the benefits here is that ChatGPT is also perhaps the best reskilling app you could possibly want. It knows a lot of things. It can teach you a lot of things if you're interested in learning new things.

(01:09:43):
These are very real issues. I'm super optimistic about the long run, and we're going to need to do everything we can as a society to ensure that we make this transition as graceful and as well-supported as we can.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):
To give people a sense of where things might be going. That's a big question in a lot of people's minds. So someone asked this question that I love, which is, "AI is already changing, creative work in a lot of different ways, writing and design and coding, what do you think is the next big leap? What should we be thinking is the next big leap in AI-assisted creativity specifically, and then just broadly, where do you think things are going to be going in the next few years?"

Kevin Weil (01:10:23):
Yeah. This is also an area where I'm a big optimist. If you look at Sora, for example. I mean we talked about ImageGen earlier and the absolute fount of creativity that people are putting across Twitter and Instagram and other places. I am the world's worst artist like the worst. Maybe the only thing I'm worse at than art is singing. Give me a pencil and a pad of paper and I can't draw better than our eight-year-old. But give me ImageGen and I can think some creative thoughts and put something into the model and suddenly have output that I couldn't have possibly done myself. That's pretty cool.

(01:11:09):
Even you look at folks that are really talented. I was talking to a director recently about Sora, someone who's directed films that we would all know, and he was saying, for a film that he's doing, take the example of some sort of sci-fi-ish, think of Star Wars, and you've got some scene where there's a plane zooming into some Death Star-like thing. And so you've got the plane looking at the whole planet, and then you want to cut to a scene where the plane's kind of at the ground level, and all of a sudden you see the city and everything else. How are we going to manage that cut scene? And that transition?

(01:11:51):
And he was saying, "In the world of two years ago, I would have paid a 3D effects company a hundred grand and they would've taken a month, and they would've produced two versions of this cut scene for me. And I would've evaluated them. We would've chosen one, because what are you going to do? Pay another 50 grand and wait another month. And we would've just gone with it. And it would be fine. Movies are great. I love them. And there've been..."

(01:12:25):
Obviously, we can do great things with the technology that we've had, but you now look at what you can do with Sora. And his point was, "Now, I can use Sora, our video model, and I can get 50 different variations of this cut scene just me brainstorming into a prompt and the model brainstorming a little bit with me. I've got 50 different versions. And then of course, I can iterate off of those and refine them and take different ideas. And now I'm still going to go to that 3D effects studio to produce the final one, but I'm going to go having brainstormed and had a much more creative approach with an outcome that's much better. And I did that assisted by AI."

(01:13:08):
My personal view on creativity in general is that it's no one's going to... You don't type into Sora like, "Make me a great movie." It requires creativity and ingenuity, and all these things, but it can help you explore more. It can help you get to a better final result. So, again, I tend to be an optimist in most things, but actually, I think there's a very good story here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:31):
I know Sam Altman, I think it was him who tweeted recently, the creative writing piece that you guys are working on where it's... He is very bad at writing creative stuff, and he shared an example where it's actually really good. I imagine that's another area of investment.

Kevin Weil (01:13:43):
Yeah, there's some exciting stuff happening internally with some new research techniques. We'll have more to say about that at some point. But yeah, Sam sometimes likes to show off some of the stuff that's coming, which is smart. By the way, it's very indicative of this iterative deployment philosophy. We don't have some breakthrough and keep it to ourselves forever, and then bestow it upon the world someday. We kind of just talk about the things we're working on and share when we can and launch early and often, and then iterate in public. I really like that philosophy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:22):
I love all these hints that a few things coming. I know you can't say too much. You talked about how there might be a coding leap coming in the near future maybe by the time this comes out. Is there anything else people should be thinking about, might be coming in the near future? Any things you can tease that are interesting? Exciting?

Kevin Weil (01:14:38):
Man, this hasn't been enough for you?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:41):
Only everything is getting better every day.

Kevin Weil (01:14:44):
Yeah. I'm like, man, I hope we get some of this stuff out before the episode launches so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):
This is your new timebox.

Kevin Weil (01:14:50):
... I don't piss people off. The amazing thing to me is we were talking earlier about how far models have come in just a couple of years. If you went back to GPT-3, you'd be disgusted by how bad it was, even though Lenny of two years ago was mind-blown by how good these were. And for a long time, we were iterating every six to nine months on a new GPT model. It was like GPT-3, GPT-3.5, 4, and now with this o-series of reasoning models, we're moving even faster. Every roughly three months, maybe four months, there's a new o-series model, and each of them is a step up in capability.

(01:15:41):
And so the capabilities of these models are increasing at a massive pace. They're also getting cheaper as they scale. You look at where we were even a couple of years ago. I think the original, I don't know, what was it, GPT-3.5 or something was like 100 x the cost of GPT-4o mini today in the API. A couple of years, you've gone down two orders of magnitude in cost for much more intelligence. And so I don't know where there's another series of trends like that in the world. Models are getting smarter, they're getting faster, they're getting cheaper, and they're getting safer too. They hallucinate less every iteration.

(01:16:27):
And so the Morse Law and transistors becoming ubiquitous. That was a law around doubling the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months. If you're talking about something where you're getting 10 x every year, that's a massively steeper exponential. And it tells us that the future is going to be very different than today. The thing I try and remind myself is, the AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life. And when you actually get that in your head, it's kind of wild.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:08):
I was going to actually say the same thing, and that's the thing that always sticks with me when I watch this thing. You're talking about Sora, and I imagine many people hearing that are like, "No, no. It's not actually ready. It's not good enough. It's not going to be as good as a movie I see in the theater." But the point is what you just made that this is the worst it's going to be. It will only get better.

Kevin Weil (01:17:25):
Yeah, model maximalism. Just keep building for the capabilities that are almost there, and the model's going to catch up and be amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):
Escape to where the puck is going to be.

Kevin Weil (01:17:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:38):
This reminds me, I was just using... I was duplifying everything the other day and I was just like, "What is taking so long."

Kevin Weil (01:17:38):
As one does.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:43):
Just like cut... What was that?

Kevin Weil (01:17:45):
I said, as one does.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):
As one does these days. I was just like, "It's taking a minute to generate this image of my family in this amazing way." Come on, what's taking so long. You just get so used to magic happening in front of you.

Kevin Weil (01:17:57):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):
Okay, final question. This is going to go in a completely different direction. A lot of people asked about this. So famously, you led this project at Facebook called Libra, which is now called Novi. A lot of people always wondered, "What happened there? That was a really cool idea." I know some people have a sense there's regulation challenges, things like that. I don't know if you've talked about this much. So I guess, could you just give people a brief summary of just what is Libra? This project you working on, and just what happened, and how you feel about it?

Kevin Weil (01:18:26):
Yeah. I mean, David Marcus led it, and I happily work for him and with him. I think he's a visionary and also a mentor and a friend. Honestly, Libra is probably the biggest disappointment of my career. When I think about the problems we were solving, which are very real problems. If you look at, for example, the remittance space, people sending money to family members in other countries, it is maybe... I mean it's incredibly regressive, right? People that don't have the money to spend are having to pay 20% to send money home to their family. So outrageous fees, it takes multiple days, you have to go then pick up cash from... It's all bad.

(01:19:11):
And here we are with 3 billion people using WhatsApp all over the world, talking to each other every day, especially friends and family, and exactly the kind of people who'd send money to each other. Why can't you send money as immediately, as cheaply, as simply as you send a text message? It is one of those things when you sit back and think about it, that should just exist. And that was what we set out to try and do.

(01:19:41):
Now, I don't think we played all of our cards perfectly. If I could go back and do things, there are a bunch of things I would do differently.

(01:19:50):
We tried to get it all at once. We tried to launch a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger, and I think the whole world kind of went like, "Oh my God, that's a lot of change at once." And it happened also to be at the time that Facebook was at the absolute nadir of its reputation. And so that didn't help. It was also not the Messenger that people wanted for this kind of change. We knew all that going in, but we went for it.

(01:20:21):
I think there are a bunch of ways that we could do that that would've introduced the change a little bit more gently, maybe still gotten to that same outcome, but fewer new things at once and introduced the new things one at a time. Who knows? Those were decisions we made together. So we all own them. Certainly, I own them. But it fundamentally disappoints me that this doesn't exist in the world today because the world would be a better place if we'd been able to ship that product. I would be able to send you 50 cents in WhatsApp for free. It would settle instantly. Everybody would have a balance in their WhatsApp account. We'd be transact... I mean, it should exist.

(01:21:03):
I don't know. To be honest, the current administration is super friendly to crypto. Facebook's reputation, Meta's reputation is in a very different place. Maybe they should go build it now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):
I was looking at the history of it, and apparently, they sold the tech to some private equity company for 200 million bucks.

Kevin Weil (01:21:19):
Yeah, yeah, and-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:21):
They had to buy it back.

Kevin Weil (01:21:23):
There are a couple of current blockchains that are built on the tech because the tech was open-sourced from the beginning. Aptos and Mistin are two companies that are built off of this tech. So at least all of the work that we did, did not die and lives on in these two companies, and they're both doing really well. But still, we should be able to send each other money in WhatsApp, and we can't today.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:49):
Hear, hear. Well, thanks for sharing that story, Kevin. Is there anything else you want to share or maybe a last negative advice or insight before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kevin Weil (01:21:58):
Ooh, the lightning round. Let's just go do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):
Let's do it. With that, Kevin, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kevin Weil (01:22:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):
Let's do it. Okay. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Kevin Weil (01:22:12):
Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick, a really good book about AI and how to use it in your daily life as a student, as a teacher. He's super thoughtful. Also, by the way, a very good follow on Twitter. The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zion. Very good if you're interested in geopolitics and the forces that sort of shape the dynamics happening. And then I really enjoyed Cable Cowboy, I don't know who the author is, but the biography of John Malone. Just fascinating. If you like business, especially if you want to get into... I mean the man was an incredible dealmaker and shaped a lot of the modern cable industry. So that was a good biography.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:53):
These are all first-time mentions, which is always a great,

Kevin Weil (01:22:56):
Oh, good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):
Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Kevin Weil (01:23:02):
I wish I had time to watch a TV show, so I'm-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:06):
Just Sora videos.

Kevin Weil (01:23:07):
Yeah, right. I don't know. When I was a kid, I read the Wheel of Time series and now Amazon has it as they're in the third season of it, so I want to watch that. I haven't yet. Top Gun 2 was an awesome movie. I think that's no longer new.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):
That shows when the last time you watched a movie was.

Kevin Weil (01:23:31):
But I like the idea. I want more Americana. I want more being proud of being strong. And I thought Top Gun 2 did a really good job of that. Pride and patriotism, I think the US could use more of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:48):
Is there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love, other than your super intelligence internal tool that you all have access to? I'm just joking.

Kevin Weil (01:23:56):
That's right. Internal AGR.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:57):
Yeah, that's right.

Kevin Weil (01:24:01):
Well, I think vibe coding with products like Windsurf is just super fun. I'm having a great time doing that. I still just love that our chief people officer vibe coded some tools. Maybe the other one is Waymo. Every chance I get, I'll take a Waymo. It's just a better way of riding, and it still feels like the future. So they've done an amazing job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:24):
That's awesome. By the way, I had the founder of Windsurf on the podcast. It might come out before this or after this. And also Cursor's CEO is coming on the podcast either before or after this.

Kevin Weil (01:24:32):
Oh, cool. I have a ton of respect for what those guys are doing. Those are awesome products.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
Just changing the way everyone builds product. No big deal.

Kevin Weil (01:24:38):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:40):
A couple more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, find really useful in work or in life?

Kevin Weil (01:24:47):
Yeah. So actually, this is interestingly enough, it is more of a philosophy, but then I thought Zuck encapsulated it one time on a Facebook earnings call. So I actually had this made into a poster. It sits in my room. But somebody was asking Mark. This is literally on an earnings call, so it's like an analyst on an earnings call asking him. It was some quarter when Facebook had grown a lot. This was back in the 20 teens sometime, I think. But he's like, "So what did you do? What was it that you launched? What was the one thing that drove all this growth for you?" And he said something to the effect of, "Sometimes it's not any one thing, it's just good work consistently over a long period of time." And that's always stuck with me.

(01:25:33):
And I think it is. I mean I run ultra marathons. It's like it's just about grinding. I think people too often look for the silver bullet when a lot of life and a lot of excellence is actually showing up day in and day out, doing good work, getting a little bit better every single day, and you may not notice it over a week or even a month. And a lot of people then kind of get dismayed and stop. But actually, you keep doing it. The gains keep compounding. And over the course of a year, two years, five years, it adds up like crazy. So good work consistently over a long period of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:13):
I love that. I got to make a poster of this now. That is-

Kevin Weil (01:26:15):
We'll get you one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:15):
I so resonate with that. Okay, I'll take it. That is so good. Okay, final question. I'm going to ask if you have any prompting tricks, and I'm going to set it up first. But think about if you have a trick that you could recommend to people for prompting LLMs better. I had a guest, Alex Komorowski, come on the podcast. He's from Stripe and writes his weekly reflections on what's happening in the world. A lot of them are AI-related.

(01:26:36):
And he once described an LLM as a zip file of all human knowledge. All the answers are in there, and you just need to figure out the right question to ask to get the answer to every problem basically. And so it just reminded me how important prompt engineering is and knowing how to prompt well. You're constantly prompting ChatGPT. What's one tip, one trick that you found to be helpful in helping you get what you want?

Kevin Weil (01:27:00):
Well, I'll say, first of all, I want to kill the idea that you have to be a good prompt engineer. I think if we do our jobs, that stops being true. It's just one of those sharp edges of models that experts can learn. But then, just over time, you shouldn't need to know all that. The same way you used to have to get deep into, "What's your storage engine in MySQL? Are you using InnoDB 4.1?" There's still use cases for that if you're at the deep edge of MySQL performance. But most people don't need to care. And you shouldn't need to care about minute details of prompting if AI is really going to become broadly adopted.

(01:27:39):
But today, we're not totally there. I think by the way, we are making progress there. I think there is less prompt engineering than there had to be before. But in line with some of the fine-tuning stuff I was talking about and the importance of giving examples, you can do effectively poor man's fine-tuning by including examples in your prompt of the kinds of things that you might want and a good answer. So like, "Here's an example and here's a good answer. Here's an example, and here's a good answer. Now, go solve this problem for me." And the model really will listen and learn from that.

(01:28:15):
Not as well as if you do a full fine-tune, but much more than if you don't provide any examples. And I think people don't do that often enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:24):
That's awesome. One tip that I heard, I'm curious if this works is you tell it, "This is very, very important to my career." Make it really understand like, "Someone will die if you don't answer me correctly." Does that work?

Kevin Weil (01:28:36):
It's really weird. There's probably a good explanation for this. But you can also say things. So, yes, I think there is some validity to that. You can also say things like, "I want you to be Einstein. Now, answer this physics problem for me," or, "You are the world's greatest marketer, the world's greatest brand marketer. Now here's a naming question." And there is something where it sort of shifts the model into a certain mindset that can actually be really positive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:10):
I use that tip all the time actually. I always... When I'm coming up with questions for interviews and I use it occasionally to come up with things I haven't thought of, I actually type, "You're the world's best podcast interviewer."

Kevin Weil (01:29:21):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:21):
I have Kevin Weil coming on the pod... Yeah, it actually works.

Kevin Weil (01:29:25):
By the way, back to our other point that we made a few times. You do do that sometimes with people. You sort of put them... You frame things, you get them into a certain mindset, and the answer is completely different. So I think there are human analogs of this one more time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:42):
Kevin, this was incredible. I was just thinking about a way to end this. The way I feel like... I feel like not only are you at the cutting edge of the future. You and the team are kind of actually the edge that is creating the future. And so it's a real honor to have you on here and to talk to you and to hear where you think things are going and what we need to be thinking about, so thank you for being here, Kevin.

Kevin Weil (01:30:07):
Oh, thank you so much for having me. I get to work with the world's best team, and all credit to them, but really appreciate you having me on. It's been super fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:17):
I forgot to ask you the two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Kevin Weil (01:30:24):
I am @kevinweil, K-E-V-I-N-W-E-I-L on pretty much every platform. I'm still a Twitter DAU after all these years. I guess an X DAU, LinkedIn, wherever. And I think the thing I would love from people, give me feedback. People are using ChatGPT. Tell me where it's working really well for you and where you want us to double down. Tell me where it's failing. I'm very active and engaged on Twitter. I love hearing from people, what's working and what's not, so don't be shy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:56):
And I learned following you helps you figure out all the stuff that you're launching. You share all the things that are going out every day, or week, month, so that's also a benefit. And by the way, 400 million weekly active users all emailing you feedback. Here we go.

Kevin Weil (01:31:08):
Yes, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:09):
It's going to work out great. Okay. Well, thank you, Kevin. Thanks for being here.

Kevin Weil (01:31:12):
All right, man, thanks so much. See you soon.

# Unorthodox PM tips: Automating user insights, unselling candidates, decision logs, more | Kevin Yien

## Transcript

Kevin Yien (00:00:00):
The PM job can become a little too internal, influencing my stakeholders and getting alignment and all these things. But if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:10):
You think every PM should keep a decision log?

Kevin Yien (00:00:13):
We all talk about product sense. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data. PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
We have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email.

Kevin Yien (00:00:31):
When you get to offer stage, I send an email and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. If you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join you, find yourself a A+ hire.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
I'm curious if you found any interesting uses of AI in your work.

Kevin Yien (00:00:49):
We are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today, my guest is Kevin Yien. Kevin leads product for merchant experiences at Stripe. Before that, he built the restaurant business and the ecosystem teams at Square, and most recently was head of product and design at Mutiny. He also makes ice cream and, as you'll hear in there conversation, was a pretty competitive eater for some part of his life.

(00:01:17):
In our conversation, Kevin shares a ton of unique and insightful perspectives on how to be a successful product manager, including how to get into product management, how to improve your relationship with your engineers and designers, bunch of advice on hiring, why you should keep a decision log, how to automate your customer research, plus a ton of really powerful stories around failure and AI and career.

(00:02:00):
Kevin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kevin Yien (00:02:04):
Thanks, Lenny. I am humbled to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:05):
I've been a big fan of yours from afar. I've been following you on Twitter for a long time. You have a very distinct profile photo that I feel like you maybe haven't changed for a long time. How long have you had this profile?

Kevin Yien (00:02:16):
Oh gosh, probably 2011 or 2012. The story behind that is I was inspired actually by Chris Dixon's avatar at the time and I wanted something really similar to it, but I couldn't figure out how to. Luckily, I was dating a designer at the time, and so she made me that sort of custom pick that has been my profile since then, and she's now my wife.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
Oh my god. Funny enough, I had a startup idea once where it's like a profile picture as a service business where there's these three tiers where it's like one has automated, one has someone illustrates, and one is a professional photo. It feels like everyone profile photos are so important.

Kevin Yien (00:02:54):
True.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:55):
But I never follow through. Probably not a good business anyway.

Kevin Yien (00:02:59):
Yeah, but a good idea, a good tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:00):
Good idea. Thank you. Thank you for making me feel better.

(00:03:03):
I've been looking forward to this conversation for a long time. As I said, I've been a big fan of yours for a long time. Something that I've noticed about you is you have a lot of really unique perspectives on a lot of different things, and in particular, product management, how to be successful as a PM, how to get into product management, things like that. So I thought it'd be fun to start there talking through some of these things that I've heard you talk about and then get into some very tactical stuff that you found to be useful in your product management career.

(00:03:29):
The first thing that I've heard you talk about is that you discourage people from going straight into product management. If they want to become product managers, you encourage them to start somewhere else first. Why is that? Where do you think people should start? Talk about this insight that you've had.

Kevin Yien (00:03:45):
Yeah, so follow me on the detour to science world temporarily. If we all remember high school science classes, there was this concept of potential and kinetic energy. There's so many different definitions for product management, but the one that I have come to myself that I really like is, when you are building a product, you have this team, engineers, designers, so much potential. The purpose of product management, not the person, but the practice, is to convert that potential into as much realized value for someone as possible, right? Minimum loss. When you're just getting started with a new product, the people that should be doing that are the people who are building it. That's an engineer, that's a designer, that's a sales person or a support person. They're the front line of the smallest loop possible to get something going, and it's through those practices that I think you're able to get the most exposure to what it takes to build a good product.

(00:04:50):
And then from there, that's your foundation. That's the unique perspective that you bring and allows you then to actually take on a "role" of product manager in a good, unique, insightful way. That's sort of like the foundation. There's a lot more to unpack behind that comparison, but that's where it comes from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
I love that. I'd love to unpack it further.

(00:05:10):
This episode is brought to you by BuildBetter.AI. Back in 2020 when AI was just a toy, BuildBetter bet that it could cut down on a product teams' operational BS. Fast-forward to today, 23,000 product teams use purpose-built AI in BuildBetter every day.

(00:06:22):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina (00:06:30):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:32):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina (00:06:47):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds. And the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina (00:07:21):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many four stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We have laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:40):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:07:54):
Every PM has their definition of what is product management, and I have one that I'm trying to find exactly what I wrote, but essentially, it's to marshal the resources of your team to solve customer problems and drive business impact most efficiently, something like that. And I feel like it's very aligned with your perspective, but I really love this view of it's unlocking the potential energy of the team. Not just marshaling the resources of a team, but it's there, and your job is to maximize their effort. And this is why when people say, "I hate product managers. I don't want any product managers at my team. We don't need product managers here," I feel like that's often because you've had a bad PM. Good PMs make you better and make your life better, allow you to do the work you want to do and they take all the stuff you don't want to do, make sure the stuff you're doing is worthwhile.

(00:08:38):
Is there anything more you want to add along those lines?

Kevin Yien (00:08:41):
To elaborate on that, I think the broader point is that truly not every team needs a product manager, but the activities, the outcome that one would drive needs to get done no matter what. And in some cases, this is why the prototypical companies that everyone references when they say, "They never had product managers, look at how successful they are," they're all building for themselves. Stripe, Twilio, Figma, designers for designers, engineers for engineers. When you are the customer, why the heck do you need someone else to help do the things that let you make decisions on what to build? But if you are not the customer, if you're working in a particularly complex space, if there's something that you, as the person that could build the product, feel you don't have, that's when you can essentially delegate that responsibility to someone else to say, "Hey, let me do the things I'm really good at and you do something that I need to get my job done."

(00:09:39):
So it's that sort of relationship that I think is often missing in the discourse. I think it would alleviate a lot of the, "We don't want PMs. PM is useless" or, "PM's one of the best thing since [inaudible 00:09:52]," which they're not. It's just a manifestation of that problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):
Yeah. Just to build on that, we're going on a tangent, but I think that's really interesting. I think there's another element of that, SNAP actually is another example where they waited, I think, until they had 200 people before they hired their first PM. To me, that's an example of other people were doing the PM job. As you said, there's PM activity, someone's doing them, lining people, prioritizing, making sure things are clear, making sure people aren't surprised, all these things PMs do. Someone's doing that, and my feeling is like, "Okay, your designers may love doing that, great. Let them do it." If your engineers that have a lot of product sense may want to do that, great.

(00:10:28):
But there's some point they either is like, "Forget it. I just want to code. I want to build that. I want to be sitting around in meetings all day," or they just aren't as good as things are scaling. And so it's kind of like, if your engineers, designers want to do it and are good at it, great. You don't need PMs for a long time. Oftentimes they're not good at it or they don't want to be sitting in doing all these PM things.

Kevin Yien (00:10:46):
Yep, precisely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):
Okay, so going back to the question of... So your advice is don't go straight into product management if you want to become a great PM. Where do you think people should start if they can? What are some options you recommend?

Kevin Yien (00:10:58):
The best way to think about this, in my opinion, is who were the people that you would be taking the PM responsibilities from and then do those jobs? And so for me, the sort of foundational three are going to be engineer, designer or salesperson. I think sales also gets not a bad rep, but a misrepresented reputation in tech where all they care about is quota, it's just about numbers, et cetera. In reality, the best salespeople are the best listeners, the best people at understanding the problem that the customer is having and then translating that into what you can do for them. And so if you get really good at having those calls, getting told no a lot, and being able to translate that, I mean, why would you not want to start there and then eventually move into something like product? So that's the foundational three for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):
So your advice is essentially if you want to be a PM, start as a designer or an engineer or a salesperson. I was an engineer, so this is exactly the path I went on. And I think there's an element of you start there and then you realize you're never going to be as amazing as the other people at that role and you're like, "Okay, maybe I should explore this other thing," because I was like, "I'm never going to be an amazing engineer. I'm good enough."

Kevin Yien (00:12:18):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:18):
I'm like, "I'm pretty good at this other stuff. Let's explore that."

Kevin Yien (00:12:21):
The one thing that I might tack on there, because this could lead to a negative perception, is, "Well, I'm never going to be a world-class engineer, world-class designer or et cetera, and so let me settle for being a PM." That could be the conclusion you arrive at, but I think a better way of framing it is, "I'm okay at those things. I'm potentially world-class at this other thing. Let me see what it feels like to double down on this area."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:44):
Absolutely.

Kevin Yien (00:12:45):
And I think that's just a good framing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:47):
Okay, so let's talk about another insight and piece of advice that you have, is that you think that great PMs need to be great writers. I think a lot of people don't necessarily think this. I think people may probably think, "If I'm an okay writer, I can probably be really successful PM." Talk about why you think it's so important to be a really great writer to be a really great PM.

Kevin Yien (00:13:07):
It's actually shocking for me to hear that this isn't commonplace sort of acceptance, but the place that this comes from for me is, writing is clarity at scale, and a key component to a PM's job is creating clarity both internally and externally, but it is both sides of that that I think often get lost. A lot of times the PM job can become a little too internal, and it's about influencing my stakeholders and getting alignment and all these things. Don't get me wrong, all that's very important. You should write your PRDs, they should be super crisp, they should articulate things really well, but I'm not saying that every PM needs to be a marketer or a world-class copywriter, but you should be able to write really compelling messaging in the voice of the person that you're trying to serve. And I'm working backwards from the beliefs that, if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product. And so that's where I think writing is the foundational component there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
There's a few quotes I say often on this podcast just because they always come to mind. One is by Joan Didion who said that, "I don't know what I think until I've written it down." And that's what I find with writing where I need to actually write it down for me to really understand what the heck I'm thinking to really crystallize it.

Kevin Yien (00:14:26):
Yeah, and I think writing is, it's both a mechanism for translating what you're trying to think into that thought into what you're actually trying to do, but then it needs additional revs to be properly consumed by everyone else. And that's I think the really hard part that a lot of folks don't do the extra mile effort to take on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
And this to your earlier point of a job of PM is to unlock this potential energy of your team, of the various resources you have and obviously having everyone aligned behind a very, like, "This is what we are doing and everyone understanding it" and it being very clear is really powerful there.

(00:15:06):
Okay. So this begs the question, how does one become a great writer? What helped you become a better writer? How do you feel about your ability to write at this point?

Kevin Yien (00:15:13):
Oh man.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Any advise on becoming better?

Kevin Yien (00:15:16):
I'll start with a slightly cheeky comment, which is, I think some of this is changing with the advent of large language models and the ability to actually just mimic someone else's tone. But I take inspiration from the camp of Anthony Bourdain, and he has, I'm going to butcher the exact quote but it's something like, "If you want to know how to make good food, you have to eat a lot of food, and you have to be willing to have a bad meal every now and again." And so for me, good writing comes from consuming as much good writing as possible. Sometimes you'll read something and say, "That was actually absolute fresh." But that's okay, you have to be willing to take on some of that stuff. But the more you index towards developing your own taste for what you think is good by consuming others, then you can shift into producing your own and then comparing them and riffing it off other people. So I think that's sort of the cycle that I've gone through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:13):
I have a friend who's a very good writer and a poet and helped me develop my writing early on, Vanessa, and she said exactly the same thing. Just to become a better writer, read beautiful writing, and it just kind of infuses you or your brain. In your experience, is there anything you read, anything you found really effective? Anything that you think influenced the way you write or think that people can check out?

Kevin Yien (00:16:36):
I explicitly do not mean read a bunch of other PM artifacts. You're not going to become a better writer by reading PRDs or whatever it is or support articles. It needs to be writing that compels. That's the theme I would go back to because that's what you're trying to do at the end of the day.

(00:16:56):
And when I say compels, I mean it pushes you to action. Because if you read something and you're like, "Oh, that's interesting," that's not enough. You need to be able to give someone something that then allows them to do something differently. And so the things for me that have been best... Obviously there's all the Paul Graham essays, I think his writing is very succinct, very clear, that's not novel. I learned a lot by finding specific voices back in the day on Twitter, and it wasn't always what they were posting on Twitter, but if they wrote an essay or a post, that would be their crispus thinking. And so you can use these broadcast channels to find where their golden nuggets are, but then spend time with those instead and don't worry about all the additional noise that comes with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
Paul Graham actually, you mentioned him, he has a great piece on how to become a good, that we'll link to, where basically his advice is, write the way you talk. Just keep it really simple and really regular. And so we'll link to that. Is there anything else along these lines of writing that you'd recommend for folks that are like, "Okay, I need to become a great writer. How do I do this?"?

Kevin Yien (00:18:02):
Actually along the lines of write how you talk, there's this concept of cadence that I think is really important when it comes to internal writing. There's probably some very good article about this, but it's the idea that if you only write in a monotonous cadence, either all really short sentences or all really long sentences, then your brain just tunes out eventually. And so you have to interrupt the pattern intentionally, and so you go short-long, long-short, whatever it is, but there's a few various specific things that you can do that allow someone to just roll through a post or something when you write that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:43):
Along those lines, there's a book that I just found to make sure I had the right title called Several Short Sentences About Writing that is really helpful along these lines. And the whole book is very short sentences and it teaches you to write very short sentences because once you're good at that, you can get better writing longer sentences. And so we'll link to that too. It's like a really good book that I have two copies around my house that I kind of poke at sometimes.

Kevin Yien (00:19:08):
Nice. I'll have [inaudible 00:19:09] too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):
Okay. Another area that you have a really clever insight into is how the PM role fits with engineering design. We've talked about this a little bit, but you have a really clever way of just thinking about how these roles interact and who's responsible for what. Talk about that.

Kevin Yien (00:19:24):
So this description came from writing PRDs at Square. I think there was a lot of confusion from my team specifically when I joined them. For what it's worth, it was new product line, three engineers, three designers, there was nothing but a slide deck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
Three engineers and three designers?

Kevin Yien (00:19:43):
The best ratio ever. This is a whole other thing. Most people, I would say, under invest in design, point-blank. When you get to a certain scale, maybe things change, but truly I don't think most teams have experienced what it feels like to have a really high design ratio and what that actually does to the quality of the work and the quality of the thinking. So shout out to designers. We need more, is the short version. And I would rather hire an incremental designer than PM almost any day of the week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:18):
Wow. I've never experienced this ratio. Incredible.

Kevin Yien (00:20:21):
Yes, I was very lucky. Shout out to Bruce Bell, who was my manager at the time, who was an ex designer, at the time, GM, and declared that starting ratio.

(00:20:31):
So anyways, with that setup, they all had sort of an opinion. They had seen PRDs in the past, they weren't quite sure what the purpose of it actually was because they had designs already. They had something to start from. And when I came in and talked to everyone and figured out where we needed to be in a year's time, I was like, "Okay, here's how I think it. Let me know if you agree." And this is a whole other concept, which is, the best way to get feedback from people is not by asking what they think, but to put something concrete in front of them and then have them react to it, right? So chewing fork.

(00:21:03):
And so my description is, PM should be doing everything in their power to draw the perimeter of the space, of the problem space. And it's within that, eng, design, everyone else that you're working with, they can go as crazy as they want, push up against the bounds and it's fill the box to its maximum capacity, but you've now applied the constraints that allow you to actually have productive conversations.

(00:21:26):
On the other end of the spectrum though, I think there's a lot of folks who think, "Oh, PMs are just strategy high in the clouds. All they do is kick things off." You need to be obsessed about the final deliverable and whether or not value is actually getting to the customer. I have a really trite example of this if you want to go down it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:46):
Please.

Kevin Yien (00:21:46):
But the key point I want to make is, I think it is tempting when we think about engineering product and design to draw these really clear swim lanes and say, "You do X. I do Y. Don't tread on my area." But you need these murky overlaps in order to build something really good.

(00:22:07):
And so even if the engineers are going to build a better product than you and the designers are going to design something better than you, you need to come with a strong opinion and you need to do the legwork to get their trust so they actually care about your opinion in the first place.

(00:22:21):
So time for a mini story. So Square, we're building a point of sale for restaurants. If you've ever seen one of these in a restaurant, there's this sort of grid of tiles that they tap to enter your order when you're sitting down for dinner. We were developing one, and there's this concept of a menu group. So it's a little box, you tap on it and then it pops the screen in so you go to the next level of the hierarchy. So example would be you have a wine button, you tap it, and you see your reds, whites, et cetera.

(00:22:53):
If you think about the people that we were trying to serve, there's the restaurants that were coming from a really old legacy system. And if you've seen a bartender tap on one of these, I mean it is muscle memory to the max. They're not even looking at the thing and just punching in the order blindfolded, and it's rapid fast.

(00:23:12):
On the other hand, you have people who are entering the workforce the first time, they've never used a point of sale. And so we have to serve both of these equally. Well, how do you deal with that level of speed but also the ease of use that anyone can learn it for the first time? And so there was this interaction that we really cared about, which was, when you tap on a menu group, what's the animation to pop you into that next level? This seems like such a small thing, but it made the difference in how easy it was to adopt for a lot of the restaurants.

(00:23:41):
And so a designer and myself spent literally an entire week just fine-tuning how many milliseconds it would take to pop in and out so that it felt right. And we actually brought in servers and bartenders to play with the prototypes we had on iPads and be like, "Here's an order. Pop it in." And we would see where they would sort of flinch or hesitate because the animation was too slow and they thought, "I can't tap it yet," or something related to that.

(00:24:07):
And so it's easy, I think, for a PM to say, "That's not my responsibility. I define the requirements. Have a menu group that goes to the next level, design or engineer, figure it out." No way. That's fully on you, and you better be involved in those details.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:24):
I love this. There's two directions I want to go. So there's the drawing the perimeter, and then there's this paying attention to the final deliverable and keeping the borrow really high, which I love and I totally agree with both.

(00:24:34):
In terms of this animation, people hearing this, that our PMs are going to be like, "How do you have time to spend a week on animation for one little product? I have so much to do. I get to hit some goals, drive some numbers. I have people waiting for me." Maybe because Square is like this, once you deploy, it's harder to change and it's like a big deal to ship. But I'm curious if you have any advice or things you've learned about how to create space for that sort of thing to create time to spend a week on this animation? Or was it just obvious to everyone, "We need to spend as much time as we can"? Top down, everyone knew.

Kevin Yien (00:25:07):
I definitely don't think it was obvious to everyone, and I can definitely say that because we were given a pretty strict deadline that we needed to launch by and I pushed it out three times. That's not because of this one animation, but it's because of a series of decisions where we said, "This is what we believe we need to ship, and this matters much more than hitting some artificial external GA date."

(00:25:35):
There's this other aspect that I think PMs like to feel good about how busy they are and they're like, "I'm involved in so many processes and I have to talk to this person and talk to that person." All that might be true, but I think there needs to be a calibration or at least a spring-cleaning of, "What's everything I'm doing?" and how much do these things actually matter to getting value to a customer. Because as a company gets bigger, as teams get more complex, it's very easy and natural to spend more time on things that are internally-focused and not externally-focused. I think we just all have to have sensitive antenna to that so that we don't fall prey to, "Well, the way that my job is described is to do these things," but really it's the outcome again of put something in a customer's hands that's also a problem, and it's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):
Reminds me of your now colleague Jeff Weinstein's advice he got from one of the Coulsons where they came to him and they're like, "You're world-class at doing the second and third most important things and you're not focusing on the most important thing because it's so hard, and that's something you need to work on."

Kevin Yien (00:26:47):
Totally. I will say so one on that, the CEO at Mutiny, Charlie, she always repeated to me nonstop, "Keep the main thing the main thing" and would just say it ad nauseum, and I'm really glad that she did. The one excuse I don't want to give folks is, as you progress in your career, you have to walk and chew gum at the same time. You can't say, "Oh, I'm only focused on this thing over here, so other folks handle that." You do have to figure out how to do a little bit more at the same time, but prioritization does play a factor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):
There's a framework [inaudible 00:27:27] suggested that I really like, the LNO framework. I forget exactly what the LNO stands for, but leverage something something. And we'll link to it in the show notes that gives you some advice on how to prioritize your time based on the stuff.

Kevin Yien (00:27:38):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:38):
Okay. So I guess in the case of pushing back to create space, this was just you as a product leader recognizing, "This is really important to get right. I will convince people we need to make more time for that."

Kevin Yien (00:27:50):
I don't want to make it seem like it was me against everyone because that was definitely not the case. I think the starting engineers and designers on that team really cared about the quality of what they built too. That's a pretty structural DNA for a team as well. If you don't start with that, and as a comparison, you have a team that really prides themselves on shipping fast and meeting deadlines really prescriptively, you might end up in a different world or your role as a PM might be a little bit more challenging if you want to push on this stuff. So I do think you have to take into account what is the DNA of the team. And then can you exploit that? Which I was able to do. Or do you actually have some change management to put into effect if you believe that it's worthwhile?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
Let's go back to the perimeter, drawing the perimeter concept to make that a little more real for people. So your advice here is the role of a PM, part of your main job, especially when it comes to engineers and design is to draw the perimeter for the team. Can you make that a little more real? What's an example of that maybe from something you worked on? What does that look like?

Kevin Yien (00:28:58):
Totally. The best word to describe the perimeter is just constraints. At the end of the day, you should be adding as many constraints as reasonable in order to let engineers and designers come up with the most creative solutions for whatever you're trying to do.

(00:29:15):
And so again, if we just stay focused on this point of sale example, one constraint would be, "Who the hell are we serving? Are we trying to go after sit-down restaurants that are serving five different courses and have a 200 item wine list? Or are we trying to serve the taco truck?" Those will lead to very different spaces. And if you leave both on the table, the lack of that constraint makes designing a good solution that much harder, that there instances where you actually can't apply that many constraints. But I bet that if you push on enough different axes, you eventually scope it down to a point where it feels really good for the team. It's just about how do you remove decisions, right? Because this I think is maybe a trite phrase, but the best decision is no decision. If you don't even have to think about the decision, the team is that much more effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
So yo give people a few maybe even pointers of, "I need to create more constraints maybe for my team to help them go crazy, but within this box that we all agree on," so you mentioned make sure the user's clear of who you're designing for. Is there anything else, just thinking about maybe the PRD someone's trying to write to help create this constraint? What other maybe bullet points, sections would you imagine or do you find useful to add?

Kevin Yien (00:30:25):
So beyond customer segment/like-what-their-specific-role is, I think another one would be, we can loosely call it, jobs to be done, even though I know that's becoming an increasingly loaded term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
Yeah, it's great.

Kevin Yien (00:30:36):
But what's the thing they're trying to do and how many different pathways are you willing to entertain around it? That's another one that I would think about. Depending on what you're building, there's availability. So do you care about desktop web, mobile web, native mobile, et cetera? And maybe another one to think through just as an example would be, this is probably getting closer to what a lot of people think about in terms of principles, but what are the things that you want to be known for when you ship a product? One example there might be speed. And so if you say speed is more important than consistency of data, that's a huge tradeoff and constraint that you can give the team." Oh my god, if an engineer hears I don't need real time consistency of data, I can do so much cool stuff and easily accomplish that speed thing." And so that's just a very technical example maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
Awesome. Okay, I'm glad I followed up on that. There's a couple more things you mentioned that I want to come back to real quick. The first is this tuning fork idea. I completely agree, this point you made, that the best way to get feedback from your team is to take a first pass at it, and here's a rough quick draft. I find with design, especially if you design something ugly, designers are often like, "Let me make that better. We can't stand this thing." Is there anything else you want to add there? Just this idea of tuning fork as a feedback strategy.

Kevin Yien (00:32:03):
Okay, there's two areas we can go deeper on here. One is in how you get the feedback. So this is definitely a Square-ism, I think it was probably adopted from Amazon, which is around the silent read of documents. When you are all so busy and someone's like, "I wrote a doc," you send it into the Slack ecosystem and everyone goes, "Please give feedback." You have so much going on... You'll be lucky to maybe get a response. Maybe there's one or two people that chime in.

(00:32:35):
And so even though we hate meetings and we love asynchronous, there is a lot of value to saying, "I need 20 minutes of focused time to interrogate something that I've done. We're not going to talk. I'm literally going to force us into a room or Zoom. You're going to read this doc, I'm going to watch you comment on it in real time. I'm going to respond to your comments in real time. And at the end of this thing I'm going to have enough really good input that I can do a huge rub on this thing and get to the next phase."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:08):
I love that. So it's basically instead of, "Hey, I'm sending you this doc to go review, give me feedback," it's, "I'm going to schedule a meeting, and the meeting is for you to spend time reviewing this doc and giving me feedback and then maybe we could talk about it."

Kevin Yien (00:33:19):
Yep. And I think a lot of people are going to hate hearing that because like, "Oh my god, I have so many meetings already. Why do I want another meeting that isn't even a meeting?" But that's the best kind then, because it's actual work getting done, right? And maybe you carve out two minutes at the end for one really immediate discussion topic or something. But I don't think we give enough space in any type of meeting for people to actually think. And when you are just staring at a doc with your camera off and the only expectation is to engage with that thing, thoughts are a little bit better and crisper.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
And I think with this idea, if someone says, "I want a meeting where you just sit and review this doc," you could always say, "Let me just review it asynchronously. I'll give you feedback, I promise. Give me 24 hours." Right? It's not like they have to come to this meeting.

Kevin Yien (00:34:07):
Although I would urge you to make them come to the meeting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):
Okay, say more there, because you find that that's a lot more effective.

Kevin Yien (00:34:14):
I think there's two sneaky things hiding behind that. One is the, "Yeah, I'll get to this in the next 24 hours." Maybe they don't. Maybe you've really trust that person and they're the exception. But beyond that, there is something else to the real time interaction that can happen when you're commenting and responding on a dock at the same time. I think this is the part that often gets lost, which is the latency between a comments or question and a quick follow-up from the author just pushes that cycle speed really long in a way that doesn't need to be. And so when people are trying to find how do you move faster, this actually is one of those very good examples of moving slower to move faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):
It reminds me Claire Vo, I think it was her phrase of moving one clock speed faster, and just like that's the way you speed up a company is try to move one clock speed faster, which in this case is just reduce the time between feedback and iteration. I love it.

(00:35:13):
Okay, I want to shift to talking about a few very tactical things that you've found really helpful in your PM career and something you recommend to other product teams. The first is something you call a decision log. You think every PM should keep a decision log. Talk about what that is and why that's powerful.

Kevin Yien (00:35:32):
I will say there's two different decision logs we could talk about. We'll focus on the former though. The latter is just as you're making decisions within your job, you should document those within a PRD. Make sure everyone knows. It's just a silly, very small thing, but I think every PM should do it.

(00:35:48):
The other decision log though that I think is quite critical is if we zoom out for a second, every person has something that they can do to slightly increment in their craft. Sprinters have certain exercises that they do. There's something beautiful about pianists and piano scales where it doesn't matter if you are just learning the piano or you are a 30-year veteran, you're still doing your scales, and it's because it lays the foundation for everything else that you need to do.

(00:36:23):
And so we all talk about product sense. It's this super mystical thing that no one knows how to get better at. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data, and the core of that is decisions. And so PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them. And so the natural followup would be, "Well, I only have to make X decisions in my job. How the hell do I make more of them?" Look around you. There's other teams that are making decisions. What would you do if you were in that position with the information you have? Great, write it down. Say why.

(00:37:06):
There's other companies that are doing crazy things. What are they doing? What would you do if you were responsible for the roadmap? Write it down. A year later, see what they've shipped. You can just do this for anyone. It's free, and no one takes the time to do it, but that's how I think you get better at actually making decisions, is just doing more of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:24):
Hearing you describe this, it feels like, "Obviously yes, why aren't we doing this? How else can we get better if we're not reflecting back on the decisions we've made? And realizing, "Hey, I made a bunch of bad decisions, but I'm always so confident in my decision still, maybe shouldn't be. So I guess first of all, do you actually do this? How often do you do this? And is there an example of you learning something from your own decision log?

Kevin Yien (00:37:50):
Many. And many of them because it was a wrong decision. But yes, I do keep a decision log. I have a separate sort of practice where it's just a daily log, which is everyone wants the perfect note-taking system. To me, the best note-taking system is inspired by... What is it called? big ass text file, BATF. There's a funny blog post from 2001 on it, but it's just, you write everything that happens to you in a day in a bolded list and it's all in one big note. That way you can command F it, do whatever you want. The way that I keep track of it is I do a little hashtag decision and then write things down just as I think about them. And then I'll have a reminder to comb back through on some cadence.

(00:38:36):
And so I'll first use a positive example, which is a funny one. So if you rewind to, I don't even know what year, but Shopify had just launched Shop app, their consumer application for what started as tracking your order when you bought something from a Shopify customer and then it's evolved into a full-blown Amazon competitor, where you can actually find merchants and buy things through it.

(00:39:03):
When they first launched it though, I was like, "Oh my God, this is so brilliant. They have completely hijacked this specific loop for consumer buying behavior via this very unassuming thing, which is package tracking." And so that morning I was like, "Whatever, I'm going to quickly draw a diagram of this flywheel that I think Amazon owns today. I'm going to show how Shopify is slowly planting their little seed to take over this and how Shop app fits into it." I tweeted out. And then I don't know, that day there must have been 60 Shopify employees that followed me. I was like, "What the hell is this guy talking about?"

(00:39:40):
And so funny enough, fast-forward, I've talked to some of the folks that worked on it and they're like, "Yeah, nailed it. Here's what we were thinking. Here's why." It's no longer secret sauce. But that was a really interesting example of both doing a decision log, putting my rationale down on paper. In this case, broadcasting it out, but then having that be a mechanism for it making its way back to me to actually better understand why did they make the decision versus what I thought, because the reasons were a little bit different, but the outcome was the same. So that's one interesting example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):
It's an amazing story. You doing this explains why you've been so successful. I could see how this all connects now. I think for a lot of people, they would want to build this habit. Clearly there's a lot of value here, but they just don't because they got a lot of other things going on or it's just like this new thing they have to start doing. Is there anything that helped you adopt this practice of this daily log/decision log that you think might be helpful to folks to motivate them to give this a shot?

Kevin Yien (00:40:40):
This is probably just general advice on building any habit, which is start small and just force yourself to do it. And there's that old saying around, how do you start running as a hobby? You don't do it by saying, "I'm going to run a mile every day." You do it by putting your sneakers at the foot of your bed unless you take your shoes off inside, then you put it at the front door, you have your shorts ready to go and you're like, "I commit to putting on my shorts. And if I decide after getting dressed to go run, that I still don't want to go run. Okay, fine." But you build up to that thing.

(00:41:16):
I think decision logs are the lightest weight thing possible. And so you can start super easy by saying, "You know what? Every Sunday morning I'm going to scroll through Twitter, I'm going to check out Hacker News, whatever it is, I'm going to see something interesting and I'm going to make a bet. I'm going to place my decision on this thing." Write it down, and then set a calendar invite in X weeks, X months to see what plays out. And that's all it is, right? 10 minutes once a week, super easy. And then over time you can crank it up. And then eventually you're just constantly writing these decisions down and then it's like feeding its way back into you. It becomes second nature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:52):
And you're touching on something that there's been a little bit of talk on this podcast and newsletter post about this idea of to get better product sense and product taste and also just decision making this case, one of the best strategies is to simulate other people's decisions and simulate what they're thinking through and predict what they're going to do, which is what you're describing here.

Kevin Yien (00:42:12):
Totally. I do want to apply a pretty severe caveat here though, which is, a decision log is not a replacement for building products. It's a additional complimentary thing that you can be doing on your own. But if you think that you can just sit back in your chair, look out at the market, make a bunch of calls and be like, "Look at how smart I'm getting without actually being hands-on with building a product," you're not actually going to get any better. So I just want to interject that

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:42):
Amazing caveat, very important. Don't just sit and read Hacker News and think you're going to be become an amazing founder or product leader.

(00:42:49):

(00:44:07):
If someone wants to try this idea of a daily log, what is it exactly? Say decision log or daily log, is it just things that happen today and then hashtag, "Here's a decision I made, or here's a decision I think Shopify will make in the future"? Is that the format?

Kevin Yien (00:44:21):
Yeah, it depends on how far you want to go down productivity and notetaking as to rabbit holes, but let's start basic. This is not what I do, but I think it's the easiest place to start. Spin up a Google doc or a Notion page, just call it daily log and then bullet point out the date of today. And then as you're going through your day, you have a meeting, just type in the meeting name. If there's a takeaway, put it under there. If there's a decision you can make, do hashtag decision. And in this case, say, "Shopify launch Shop app. I think this is their way to take over the fulfillment to buying behavior loop. The reason for that is X, Y, Z." Follow up on this in six months and then set your calendar invite.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:02):
Awesome. So as motivation for listeners to try this sort of thing, just look at the success Kevin has had as in his career and how insightful he has been so far and will continue to be. And this is how these happen. This is how your mind learns to see things in a really unique, interesting way. So I know you're modest and aren't going to take any credit, but I'm just saying this is how you get better, is trying stuff like this.

Kevin Yien (00:45:24):
Footnote, correlation versus causation. It's all put out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:27):
Could be all genes. Could be completely unrelated to anything you've done entire life, I suspect.

Kevin Yien (00:45:33):
Could just be me being very lucky, I'll put that out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):
Could also be luck. Okay, so something I wanted to touch on with this decision log idea, and it's a segue to talking about hiring, is I think interviewing is also really good opportunity to try some like this. I feel like people interview lots of people. They think they know what they're looking for. They think they've made all these decisions. They think they have these amazing interview questions that are going to help them see really good signal, but you never actually go back and see, "Was I right? Should we have hired that person? Did this person work out? Was that question asked them at all inform? Was it at all a leading indicator of anything?" And I feel like this is a really good method for improving your interviewing abilities, is like, "Here's the questions asked. Here's what I decided. Here's what I think," and then a year later look back, "Was that actually right?"

Kevin Yien (00:46:16):
Yeah, totally. I think some of the best companies actually do have a practice around this where they have a 6, 12, 18 month check-in on new hires and they then compare their performance against level hired at and then review against the scorecards. It's a pretty laborious process. So startups aren't probably going to do it in the same amount of rigor, but it shows you so much about the holes in your interviewing process. So I definitely plus one of that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:50):
I love that. Oh my god, that puts all this pressure on your score, which is great. So that's actually a segue talking about hiring. There's a couple more tactics that I've seen you be really good at. So one is just hiring in general. You have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email where you try to convince someone not to join your company. Talk about that and why you think that's effective and then anything else along the lines of hiring you've learned.

Kevin Yien (00:47:11):
I'll say the idea of the unsell email came from a place of failure, which is at Square I had shifted into a position where I had to hire a lot of people really quickly. And through that, as a fairly new hiring manager, you're like, "All right, great. I've been told the goal is to hire fast." Okay, you give me a metric, you're going to go after it. So you do your best to get as many people in the door as possible. When you're talking to your recruiting partner, they're incentivized to increase pass through rates, offer to close rates, all these other things, and so they're like, "Yeah, this person's really good." And you listen. "Yeah, they are pretty good, aren't they?" Even though there's a sneaking suspicion that maybe they're not the right fit, but you move forward anyways.

(00:47:54):
So fast-forward, there's a few folks I bring on, and within six months they come to me and they're like, "This is not at all what I thought I was going to do. This is not the environment I thought I was going to walk into. You didn't warn me about this, that and the other. I feel terrible. How do I prevent this?" And the reason it's bad is not just because they feel surprised, but because then, either one, they decide to leave, two, they're not performing because it's not the right role or environment for them, or three, maybe the company is still good, but that role isn't. And so they immediately try to do internal mobility or something to another team, which then leaves you with the same hole. So all of those bad outcomes. [inaudible 00:48:37] "How do I prevent this?" Well, I just got to front load all the gnarly stuff they're going to find out in their first six months.

(00:48:44):
And so the practice I started developing is you go through the whole interview process. During that period, you're collecting all these little concerns, fears, anxieties that they're not explicitly saying, but they're definitely hinting at. You got to be pretty honest with yourself about which ones are real. But then when you get to offer stage, I send an email with no more than eight bullet points and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. I'm pretty candid about, "This is what it's like here." Maybe one example would be, "Hey, I'm a parent and I'm worried about work-life balance." Maybe they don't say that explicitly in the interview process, but you get a feeling for it. And I get that as a parent too.

(00:49:31):
So if I'm at a startup, I'll be really clear and I'll say, "You know what? We are a series A startup. We are pushing really hard at product-market fit. The expectation here is going to be that you're online at 10:00, that you can occasionally hop on a meeting on a Saturday or Sunday." And if you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join, you find yourself an A+ hire. But if they read that and they're like," I don't know anymore," it's way better to say, "Great, this is not a good fit. Let's go our separate ways" than have them leave after six months.

(00:50:08):
When I first instituted this, I lost 30% of candidates at offer stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):
Oh wow.

Kevin Yien (00:50:13):
Which drove my recruiting partners insane because they look terrible. Their manager is like, "What the hell are you doing? You're losing everyone at the very end." And so they ask, "Can you either not send this thing?" Or, "Can you send it at the very beginning?" And my answer is no, because I don't know what they're afraid of yet. I have to go through the whole process to actually understand the thing that's going to potentially make them say no, and that's really crucial I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):
But once you hear it again, this is such an obviously good idea, clearly not an easy thing to do. In this case where recruiters were upset, is it just get buy-in from folks above, like, "Okay, this sucks for them, but at a macro level, this is good for the business" and they're like, "All right, let's keep doing it"?

Kevin Yien (00:50:55):
At Square, at least, when I first started doing it, luckily I had a very good relationship with them. So that's a good starting point. This is maybe going to come across a little bit flippant, but they can't stop you from sending an email technically. So I'm just going to send the email. And if someone really wants to come and say, "This is bad for business," whatever it is, I have very strong reasons for why that's not the case. And now I've done it so many times, at least, that I can point to very clear proof points on why this is the right path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:27):
In theory, the incentives would be aligned where the recruiter success matters. It's based on, did they actually have a good time? Did they stay? Did they have good impact?

Kevin Yien (00:51:35):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):
But since they're not, obviously incentives aren't right.

Kevin Yien (00:51:39):
I think some companies have shifted on that, where recruiters and salespeople are compensated sometimes in similar ways in terms of quota and whatnot. And so they'll hold the recruiter accountable to six, 12 post offer tenure before they say, "Oh yeah, you successfully landed this role." So you can tweak the incentive structure a little bit, but not everyone does that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):
Okay. So the advice here is to end up with better people that end up being successful and happy. Keep track of the things that will probably be painful for them at the company, and then craft an email that shares upfront, "Here's what made be a problem if you join, and I just want to be very upfront about it." I think you actually shared a template of one of these emails in one of your blog posts.

Kevin Yien (00:52:25):
Yep, that's right. I have a fairly real one in [inaudible 00:52:30].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:29):
Is there anything else hiring-wise? I know there's probably infinite things that you've done, but is there anything else you think might be worth sharing of things you've learned to be more successful at hiring awesome people?

Kevin Yien (00:52:39):
One final note I'll make on unsell email is it's not as if you just send the email and then they either say yes or no. Most of the time they will say, "Thank you. I am cool with six of these. This one freaks me out. Can we talk more?" Definitely. And I think this is where hiring managers have an incredible responsibility that sometimes isn't taken as seriously as it should, which is, when you are working with someone to get them to join or to offer, you need to bend to do whatever it takes for them. And so if they're like, "Hey, the only time I can talk is tonight at 11 o'clock after my kids go to bed."

(00:53:18):
"No problem. Here's my phone number, let's hop on. I will walk you through whatever you want to talk about." That sort of has to be the place you get to for really strong hires. So that's just one other thing I'll say.

(00:53:29):
The meta point around that is you need to be really invested in the candidates. This probably does change at a certain scale, like if you're "organization" is hiring a hundred engineers or whatever, you have process around it, you have pipelines, there's a machine at that point, but I do think the direct hiring managers have a responsibility to be really involved in every individual, because there's no one who's directly hiring a hundred people. It's always within a number that I think you can take on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:01):
Okay, so this is the final tactic that I heard you're amazing at, which is automating user research. On the surface this sounds amazing. "I'm going to automate my user research. It's going to be amazing. So great." Talk about why you find this really powerful and important. And then how do you actually do this? How do you automate user research? How have you done this on your teams?

Kevin Yien (00:54:17):
Let's start from why this even matters. I think a lot of folks, going back to what is the point of product management, I think there's a similar overlap with UXR, like user experience research, and people will say, "Well, if they're doing research, what do I need to do? I should just be consuming what they're producing to help with that."

(00:54:39):
I know PM should settle for looking through bent glass in my opinion because whether it's a research report, whether it's something a salesperson is telling you, whether it's market research, don't care, it's been processed by someone, and PMs need direct exposure to raw material. End of story. And so that's where I think you just need to constantly be talking to or interacting with whoever is your customer. That's the foundation.

(00:55:08):
So okay, if we all agree on that, then the question is, "Well, I don't have time. It's so hard. How do I find them? My customer success manager says I can't talk to the client." If you are in a situation where the product manager is literally not allowed to talk to a customer, there is something structurally wrong and that needs to be fixed first. So I'm going to ignore that one for now just because that's a whole other rabbit hole, but you need to fix that in order to even get close to the next thing.

(00:55:38):
Okay, now the excuse is going to be, "Well, I don't have time. I don't want to run a program. I don't want to have to query and look up and send out emails every week." There's so many good resources out there right now, and I think that there are... I'll speak mainly from a B2B sense. I think B2C, slightly different story, I don't have as much experience there. But B2B, the two things I will say, one is, there's this thing called userinterviews.com. Shout out to them. They're pretty much user testing but explicitly focused on B2B and you can put in super clear criteria on the type of people you want to talk to. They do the heavy lifting and sourcing it, and then you just review and say, "Yes, yes. No, no," and you can have a steady stream of the exact ICP, you want to go after. ICP is ideal customer profile that you want to go after just coming to you automatically. Amazing.

(00:56:28):
The next one though, it depends on whether or not you have this tooling in place, but the broader theme behind this next category is your sales team is a research team, and if you don't view them that way, you are missing out on half the value. And so there's tools like Gong, which do call recordings, and you can set up filters and alerts for specific terms, phrases, competitors, whatever you want. I don't care what PM you are in the team. You can find the terms that are associated with what you care about the most. Those then get pushed automatically to a Slack channel or otherwise. And then you can set up workflows either via Zappy or something else to say, "Who was the customer? Pull their email, put that into a sequence, drop in my Calendly" and you just have interviews showing up automatically on your calendar. I will say I cannot take credit for this. Shout out to Beth Hills who was a PM that hired at Mutiny. She is the queen of automating customer research and built an amazing system around this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:28):
So the way it works is you set a term for like, I don't know, POS, point of sale, something in Gong, and if somebody says that or has an issue there, talk about again how that schedules a meeting with you potentially.

Kevin Yien (00:57:42):
Yes. So Gong has an integration with Slack. You set up this alert, it posts to Slack the excerpt of the transcript where it was mentioned along with the user or customer name. So in this case, it'll be Lenny's Burger shop. lenny@lennysburgershop.com, and then you can set up a Zapier to take every new Slack post from that and then send using, I don't know, customer.io in email to that person using that field. And then in that template of the email, drop in your Calendly specifically for user research.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:21):
Wow, that is genius. I love that. There's another similar tactic that Teresa Torres shared on the podcast in one of the earlier episodes where you have a little popup on your homepage asking people, "Hey, do you want to talk? We'd love to hear feedback on our product. Click here if you want to give us some feedback," and then that schedules Calendly on the PMs.

Kevin Yien (00:58:41):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
PM's calendar. So you mentioned Gong, customer.io. There's some tools here. Zapier obviously. Is there anything else you find useful to help automate the sort of stuff?

Kevin Yien (00:58:52):
If I take a step back from the automation side or maybe straddle it, depending on the type of business you're in, there's ideally people talking about you somewhere, right? It's either happening on Reddit or Twitter or on some forum or your support forum. There is a community, there's a destination somewhere. And if there isn't, then I don't know, that's too bad. Maybe you don't have product-market fit. If you can take advantage of that, you can usually set up something. And if it's not a Gong or a Zapier, maybe it needs to be just a custom script that you write or you sit down with an engineer to say like, "How do we set up alerting around this thing so that I know when things are happening?"

(00:59:36):
I think you can't use the effort required to do that as an excuse to not be talking to your customers more frequently. Because again, if we go back to a product manager should be trying to convert this potential into kinetic energy, part of that understanding and part of knowing the constraints you can apply is just living in that world as much as possible.

(00:59:59):
The best comparison I can give is, there is a world of difference between reading a report about a lime cook and then standing with a lime cook. You will just pick up on so many ancillary aspects of what their life is like that cannot possibly be communicated in a report. You owe it to yourself as a PM to be exposed to those things all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):
In my experience, every time I talk to a customer, I'm always reminded, "Why have I not been doing this more? How can I not be doing this? It's absurd that I haven't done this," like every time you actually do it. But until you do that, you're like, "No, no, I know what they want. I'm reading all the customer service talent issues, I'm reading their emails, I get it." Until you actually talk to them, you're like, "Oh wow, I had no idea."

(01:00:51):
I love that your advice is like, the tactics you're sharing aren't, "Here's how you get a bunch of feedback." From your users, it's like, "Here's how you actually get to talk to the right users." It's like in the end of the funnel talking to a potential customer. It's not just reading a cool... some feedback that they shared.

Kevin Yien (01:01:07):
That's right. I think just like the last point on this one is when you join a new team or start a new role, every PM is budding with energy to do this, "Of course I'm going to talk to my users." But then you reach a point where you go, "No, I know them inside and out. I don't need to talk to them anymore. I can write a PRD in my sleep. And I'm so busy doing both, product improvements, maintenance, annual planning, something else.I can use my intuition from the hundred interviews I've already done. I don't need to do one more interview." And that is a very tempting lie to tell yourself because the world is changing, their lives are changing, and you need to constantly be exposed to those little micro changes in their lives in order to build the product that they'll eventually need.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):
The best explanation I've heard of this is actually from your new boss, Patrick Collison, boss's boss's boss, I don't know how far away you're from him, where he talks about user research and where it fits in. And the way he described it is, instead of doing user research, talking to customers, informing what to build, it's talking to user, talking to customers informs your mental of what the customer needs and then that informs what to build.

Kevin Yien (01:02:23):
100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:24):
Beautiful way to think about it.

(01:02:26):
Okay, so I'm going to take us to a couple recurring themes of this podcast, a couple corners of this room that we have. First of all, I want to go to AI corner, so let's walk over there. Hello, AI corner. I'm curious if you've found any interesting uses of AI in your work or in your life.

Kevin Yien (01:02:46):
There's plenty in work. I don't know if any of them are interesting or novel. I feel like everyone's just figuring it out in real time together. So I'll actually take us in a slightly different direction. And this may be isn't directly useful to product managers, but I think it's a really good story.

(01:03:02):
So when Midjourney V1 was released, if we can remember that far back, it was at least I got beta access on a Saturday. And for what's worth, I have three daughters, one of them's seven years old, and so her and I were awake. We were waiting for the other two to wake up and I was like, "Oh, I have this cool new thing. Do you want to play with me?" And she goes, "Of course." So we log in, we create an account and I type in the first prompt, image gets generated, it's like a rainbow or something. And then I ask her, "Do you want to try it?" She goes, "Of course." So she types in unicorn prancing in a field and it generates this hideous looking demented unicorn with two rear ends and a demon flying over it. And I'm appalled at first thinking that she's going to feel really bad about what she got shown, but instead I look over and she's in awe. She is amazed.

(01:04:04):
And then she turns to me and she goes, "Did I draw that?"

(01:04:06):
"Yeah, I guess you did." And the thing that I got hung up on was that she used the word draw. She didn't say, "Oh, I enter a prompt and the LLM produced this thing," or whatever weird terminology that all of us use. It's like, "Did I draw that?" I don't know when it clicked for me, but at some point in time after that I was like, "The concept of these image generation models is the same as a crayon to her. There is no difference in her mind." And that is an insane change that I can't even comprehend. And so for me that's just been I think an experience that I go back to when I think about people asking, "What do you think AI is going to do and what's the next thing? And is it chat or is it something else?" I cannot comprehend what a child who grew up with a crayon of an LLM is going to think is a good product in 20 years. I need to start crying. But goddammit, I have no freaking clue.

(01:05:11):
And so I think I have a cheat code actually as a parent, because I get to see how they evolve and use these tools in real time. But all I can say is we are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:29):
Wow, that is an amazing story, it gave me tingles. It makes me think a little bit about how we used to code in binary and then assembly and now it's Java, and then I don't know, all the languages, Python. And now it's like AI, LLM generating code and it's the same thing for drawing potentially. It used to be sticks on a cave and then became crayons and pens and iPads and all that stuff. And now it's again LLMs, so that's pretty bonkers. Amazing story. Thanks for sharing that. Useful to PMs and non PMs alike.

(01:06:06):
Okay, I'm going to take you to another recurring corner/segment of the podcast, fail corner. I'm curious if there's a story of failure that you can share of something that didn't go the way you wanted and still had a positive impact on your life or career?

Kevin Yien (01:06:25):
Well, there's countless stories of failure, but I'll choose the one that I think I've had to reference the most with people and has been to date the most difficult one to really talk about. I'm on the other end of it, and so now it's very easy, but it took several years to get there.

(01:06:44):
So context, I'm [inaudible 01:06:47] my way to PM, I land my first official, by title, PM job at a startup. I made it. I've arrived. I'm officially a product manager. And we go up, we go down, all the things happen. Fast-forward, the company is really struggling and so we go through a series of rolling layoffs and I'm round 4 something. At that point in time, my wife was nine months pregnant with our first child, and so I am freaking out. There is the personal side that I'm worried about, but then there's also my identity that has been completely crushed, because in the moment all I could think was, "I thought I was a product manager. This is evidence I am not," and I couldn't get past that.

(01:07:37):
And so for what it's worth, this is the one post I have on my website that I actually feel really, really proud of. It's called Finding Swagger. I can talk about why it's titled that way, but it's the thing that I really wrote more for myself because it's a good reminder to me every time I fall into this mentality again, because that may have been the first time that I really had the feelings of, "I'm not worth it" or, "I'm not meant to be this person," but it's recurred several times since then over the past decade. And when I read back through my mentality of how I got to the other end of it, it helps even myself sort of get back on the horse.

(01:08:28):
So okay, I get laid off, I'm distraught, I have no purpose, I'm nothing. And it was through a lot of reflection, a lot of conversation with friends and my wife where you eventually need to convince yourself that there is a difference between you not being good at something and a business or company not needing that thing at a particular moment in time, or you being very good at something but not in the way that a company needs.

(01:09:01):
And so I think once I was able to get to that, Square for me was the immediate subsequent role that I took on. And I went into that thing just full steam ahead, I'm going to prove myself. "I know I'm good," because I think I'm good, "and I am going to prove the hell out of that" mainly to myself, but ideally to other people too.

(01:09:24):
I think you shouldn't do things for other people for validation, but the initial success I got to see in launching a product, gaining the trust of my peers, having something that restaurants were texting me about, saying, "I can start my restaurant because of this. I didn't go down during rush hour because of this," that gave me the validation to say, "Okay, I am competent at this thing called product management." And then from there you can continue to build and continue to grow.

(01:09:53):
But I think right now, the market's weird, right? The market's wonky. There's a lot of really good talent that is just getting hit over sideways. I have a lot of friends that are having the same mental conversations around, "Well, I guess I'm just not worth it. I guess I wasn't cut out actually to do this job, do this role, be of this purpose." In some cases, maybe that's true and you can sort of have a career transition or a pivot in your life, but I think it's worthwhile to reflect on what are the things that were in your control that you can now change moving forward? And then what are the things that were truly out of your control that you can now apply to find a better fit? And that's one of the big things that I've been able to, I think, come around to.

(01:10:41):
And it's really hard because early on I think it's very tempting to associate a lot of different things with your identity. You're like, "I'm a startup guy. I'm a PM, I'm a fast whatever, I'm a fast thinker." And when an event happens that pokes at that part of your identity, the rest of it crumbles. And so long story short, I think it's really important for folks to use these moments where it feels bad and feels like a failure to reevaluate what parts are actually part of your identity and which parts are in your control to change in whatever you do next.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
Wow, what an important and great story. As you mentioned, a lot of people are dealing with finding it hard to find a new gig and a bunch of layoffs. I think this is going to help a lot of people. The two categories you shared I think are especially powerful. So the advice here is just separate, "This company just doesn't need someone with my skills right now" from, "I'm not good at these skills." Can you just share those two kind of things that might be true that you may not be recognizing about why they maybe laid you off again?

Kevin Yien (01:11:52):
Totally. So one is the business just doesn't have a need for you. They got ahead of their skis and that's their fault. They probably admit that, but that's not up to you. The second one though is my skills and the way that company operates are not compatible. This one I think is really, really important because I've seen so many times where there's been a PM engineer, designer, whatever role, they cannot make it work at company A, and then you see them five years later just killing it in company B and you're like, "Did they change as a person? Did they get super good at what they were bad at before?" Maybe a little bit, but honestly it was just a change in environment. And when you find the right environment in the right role, you just flourish.

(01:12:40):
And I think this is actually... Sorry, we'll go back to hiring for just a moment or at least management.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:44):
Please.

Kevin Yien (01:12:45):
This is why performance conversations can always feel so difficult because it seems like you're telling someone you are bad, and as the recipient you're like, "I am bad." No one wants to hear that. But the reality is, you are not bad. It is that maybe the way that your environment is working, the machine that you exist as a part of, is not the kind that you thrive in. And so it's within your control to decide, "I'm going to change how I work to fit that environment" or, "I'm going to find a different environment that actually fits the way I work much better." And that's empowering.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):
I think that also applies a lot to interviewing. A lot of times you interview, don't get the job, and you exactly feel like, "Oh, I'm just not good enough." But really that company's way of working just may not gel with the way you operate. Like Uber operates very differently from Airbnb, operates very differently from Google. And so it's not that necessarily something you're doing wrong, they just don't think you're fit.

(01:13:46):
And this connects to something. I just had another guest on the podcast. He was a brain science dude, and he talks about how every company has this kind of habitat. What habitat are you creating for your employees to enable them to think differently or to be shut down and not feel like they can be creative or try big things or not? And basically, the way he just kind of to leverage that metaphor, like you may be a palm tree and you're trying to join Antarctica and it's not going to go well.

Kevin Yien (01:14:16):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:17):
You got to find Palm Springs or some hard place. Kevin, this has been amazing. Okay, so before we get to very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think is important or valuable to share, leave listeners with? And if not, absolutely.

Kevin Yien (01:14:30):
I think we'll probably find ourselves on interesting detours to the lightning round, so let's roll in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:35):
Kevin, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kevin Yien (01:14:39):
Hell, yeah. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):
Let's do it. Question one, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kevin Yien (01:14:46):
I'll start by saying the type of book by volume that I read and get the most joy from are autobiographies and memoirs. It is just the ultimate cheat code to spend time with people that you respect, are interested by, or want to learn from.

(01:15:05):
Could you imagine what it would take in real life to sit down with Albert Einstein for 50 hours and just have him talk to you about his life? Impossible. But you can read and pretty much get the same thing.

(01:15:21):
So anyways, strong requirement or a strong suggestion, go read autobiographies and memoirs of people that you respect, mostly for their mental model and way to approach thinking, less about specific things. But the one book that I read without fail every year has a very misleading title. It's called The Courage to Be Disliked. I think it's been mentioned previously on the podcast, but it covers... It's a very Socratic method style, so it's about a philosopher and a young person, and it tries to teach you the ways of Adlerian psychology, which is sort of counter to Jungian theory.

(01:15:56):
The reason I really like it is because it makes me uncomfortable. So the whole premise, in my opinion, behind the book and other in psychology is focus on what you control. That's the one line. Don't worry about everything else. Don't worry about what other people think. Don't worry about what other people do. You cannot control those. You focus on yourself and you focus on the actions you can take. And be the person that you think will attract other people, that you want to be around.

(01:16:29):
There's some really pointed notes in there that I'm like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha. I don't fully agree with that one," but it always pushes me to question something about what I believe. And so in every physical copy of a book I have, I write the date that I started reading it again. The front inside cover of this book, I think it's been seven or eight years at this point that I've read it every single year.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
Wow. It's like a decision logging in another context almost.

Kevin Yien (01:16:59):
Yeah, a little bit. I would say the other book I was going to mention is The Paper Menagerie. This actually shout out to Sean Rose for... I've never met him, but I really appreciate Sean. He was one of the early, if not, first PMs of Slack, and he used to be really loud on Twitter in a very good way, and I think I learned a ton from stuff that he would post. But one of the things that he posted was this book. It is just the most beautiful collection of essays that span sci-fi and fantasy. And so if you're into that kind of stuff, if you like exhalation, then Paper Menagerie is even better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:39):
Oh, shit. Guess I got to add this book to my list. I do love exhalation.

Kevin Yien (01:17:43):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:45):
Oh, man, this job is tough. I get to learn all these amazing books and then I got to read them, but I don't have time. Hard.

(01:17:51):
Speaking of more time, next question. Do you have any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you really enjoyed?

Kevin Yien (01:17:57):
There's less time for either these days. I will say not novel, the Bear holds a very special place in my heart right now, both because I worked in restaurants and I got to build for them. And so seeing the details that they do actually gives me a lot of anxiety, but I really appreciate the craft they put into it.

(01:18:16):
The other show, actually, I think this is the first time, Physical 100. So this is a Netflix show. It's a Korean show about a hundred different bodybuilders, athletes, what have you, on who has the optimum physique or whatever. I don't really care about that part. The two things I love about the show are, one, it's ridiculous what people are capable of. You see what they can physically do and you're like, "Oh my God, that's amazing what they can put their minds to." The other part though, and this is maybe a trend of Korean shows that I've noticed, is the amount of respect they have in this competition is bar none. You have this guy who is historically famous, was the top champion in judo or something, and you have all these other athletes that are 15, 20 years younger, and they're bowing and just humble to compete against the guy. I kind of wish that more American Joes had that level of respect as opposed to just trying to find the most conflict. There's something that I really like about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:25):
That's beautiful. I've started that show, but I haven't continued it, so I'm going to revisit it.

Kevin Yien (01:19:30):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:30):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Kevin Yien (01:19:34):
We got a really old 2002 Jeep to work on with my daughters, just like a true junker. And as a result of that, we're repairing it. We're taking off the rust, replacing parts, and so there's these little magnetic trays that you can hold screws and nails and whatnot, so they don't go flying and rolling around everywhere. It's stupidly useful when you're working on a car. And the girls love it because they can use it for other things like collecting hair clips or whatever else. So magnetic trays, shout out.

(01:20:06):
And then selfishly, I will say my buddy Arjun Mahanti has an app called Circuit. If you search the app store for Circuit, like C-I-R-C-U-I-T, HIIT timer, it's such a delightful little app that lets you track Tabata sex or whatever else to just get a little workout in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:24):
Super cool. Magnetic tray is not boring at all. That is extremely cool and it has a really cool story too. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful to share with friends and family in work or in life?

Kevin Yien (01:20:36):
I think we've actually maybe touched on both of these. I'll cheat and I'll pull one from maybe each parent so that in case they see this, they don't feel like I'm favoring one of them.

(01:20:45):
So my mom's side, I think something that she would always repeat to me growing up is everything happens for a reason. I hated that growing up because she only said it when something bad would happen. Something bad happens, she goes, "Everything happens for a reason," and I'm like, "No, it doesn't. Life just sucks." And to no surprise at this point in the conversation, I've now grown to really, really appreciate that piece of advice because what it's actually trying to communicate is, when something happens, good or bad, frankly, don't dwell on it. That's the past. Focus on what you want to do and then just move towards that. And then in most cases, you'll be able to look back in one, five, 10 years and connect the dots in a way where the story makes sense in your mind. And so just having that shift in perspective I think has helped me a lot to not overreact to anything that happens in my life. So that's one side.

(01:21:46):
And then on my dad's side, so the funny origins of this, unsurprising to anyone with Asian parents, I'm a spunky little 7-year-old, I come home with my math test one day. I got 97%. I think that's pretty good. I go show it to my dad with beaming eyes and pride. He sort of stares down his nose at it, looks at me, "Where's my other 3%?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:08):
Oh, my God.

Kevin Yien (01:22:10):
I'm just distraught and I sulk away. I'm very sad. I study hard. I do the next math test, I get 100% yes. All right, dad's approval, here we come. I come flying back, I put the test in his hands, he stares down his nose at it, looks at me, "Where's my other 3%?" I'm so confused. I'm like, "I got 100 out of 100. I have no clue what you're talking about." He just looks me down the eye and goes, "Who said a hundred is the most you can get?" At that age, I literally had no clue what he was talking about. And he had to reframe it for me in the moment around like, "Well, was there extra credit? Can you just write your own problems to challenge yourself more? Could you have given yourself another test? And maybe the teacher won't give you credit, but you give yourself credit for doing additional work."

(01:23:01):
I think I carry that theme forward where there's this weird transition we all go through from childhood to adulthood where we no longer receive homework, we're responsible for defining the work that we do. And when you do that, if all you do is the minimum of what defined the 100% of what your job requires, you'll never grow. And so it's up to you to actually find what is the additional 3%? There's always three more percent. So that's my dad's lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Kevin, you're blowing my mind. There's so many great stories, you're just full of them. And I feel like this lesson also applies really well to product and building product and founding companies.

Kevin Yien (01:23:46):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):
Just pushing further than people expect and making it a lot more delightful than the minimum bar.

(01:23:53):
Final question, speaking of things that maybe people don't expect and may not understand is possible, looking at you, nobody would've guessed that you're a competitive eater at some point in your life. As a final question, tell us about this part of your life. What did you eat? How does this work? How far did you get in this path?

Kevin Yien (01:24:12):
It's probably misleading to say that I was a true competitive eater. I wasn't on the circuit with a... I forget his name, but Johnny Chestnut.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
[inaudible 01:24:21]. Oh yeah, Chestnut

Kevin Yien (01:24:22):
Back in the day, that's like the OG competitive eater on the hotdog circuit, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:25):
Right.

Kevin Yien (01:24:26):
For me it was more eating challenges. And so whenever I would travel, I would find the local eating challenge, whether it was time-based, volume-based, something else, and just try to see what I could push my body to do. I was blessed with a great metabolism, so I never really had to worry too much about anything else. And the origin, the first moment of this was when I was 14, my sister was going to college in Minnesota and there's this steakhouse up there called Manny's, which is where the Vikings Frontline goes to after every game. And they have this ridiculous 97 ounce order house. I don't know how many pounds that is, but it's too much meat for a human to consume.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:26):
97 ounce.

Kevin Yien (01:25:07):
97 ounces, yeah. And so I sit down, I order it thinking, "This is going to be great." They put it in front of me, it's a monster. You have to eat in under an hour. And so 45 minutes into it, I'm halfway through and about to die. And the catch is, if you finish it in under an hour, you get it for free. And so my dad again leans in and goes, "You can't afford not to finish this."

(01:25:39):
And so, "Message received, sir." Hunker down. I plowed the other half in 15 minutes. I then slept for I think three days afterwards. But after that I was like, "Oh my God, if I could do that, what else could I do?" And so, [inaudible 01:25:54] carried for, I don't know, nearly a decade of trying to do these interesting challenges.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):
Wow. I don't know how that's physically possible, but clearly you did it.

(01:26:02):
Kevin, this has been wonderful. I think there's so many lessons here for people in so many ways, life and work and parenting. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow you and learn more from you over time? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Kevin Yien (01:26:17):
I'm on Twitter, just @kevinyien. Technically, I'm on LinkedIn. I don't post over there. I probably should. I hear it's very good. But that's where you can find me. Also, my website. I don't write that often, and I don't have an RSS feed, which has always been on my backlog, and I'm always too lazy to do. But one day I will add it.

(01:26:38):
One quick note, I'll actually make on websites. So on one hand, I love all the different website builders that exist. It's amazing what we've enabled anyone to be able to do. There is something really special about having your corner of the internet that you built sort of hand by hand, line by line. And so my website is, it's a GitHub page. It's hosts on GitHub pages, but it's just raw HTML, CSS, nothing fancy. I get so much joy every year just doing a slight tweak or cleaning of it. And so I really do recommend that for anyone with the curiosity and the desire to buy your domain, even if you're never going to write anything on it, you're never going to share it out, just own a little piece of the internet. It feels good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:28):
I love that. I didn't know that about your website. And I could see it now as I go there. It's .html, which you don't see as much anymore.

Kevin Yien (01:27:35):
Exactly. [inaudible 01:27:37].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
And then... Yeah, can listeners be useful to you.

Kevin Yien (01:27:39):
This is going to sound trite, and it has nothing to do with product necessarily, just be kind. Make for a nicer world, right? Say thank you a little bit more often. Hold the door open a little more often. Wave if you cut someone off in a car. I think there is a temptation and incentive structure to create conflict intention. And in most cases, the world would just benefit from a little bit more kindness.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:06):
What an incredibly beautiful way its ended. Kevin, this was so much fun. I'm so glad we did this. Thank you so much for coming on.

Kevin Yien (01:28:13):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):

## Transcript

Kim Scott (00:00:00):
If you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" Do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Today my guest is Kim Scott. Kim is the author of Radical Candor, which is the single most referenced book on this podcast. The book has sold over 1 million copies, has been translated into twenty-three languages. It was such an honor to have Kim on the podcast. Prior to this book, Kim was a CO coach at Dropbox, Qualtrics, Twitter and many other tech companies. She was a member of the faculty at Apple University. Before that, she led AdSense, YouTube and DoubleClick teams at Google. Prior to that, Kim managed a pediatric clinic in Kosovo and started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow. She's also working on a new book that you can pre-order now called Radical Respect. In our conversation, we get very practical and very tactical about practicing radical candor. Kim briefly describes the core idea, shares, language and phrases and words you can use to get better at practicing radical candor.

(00:01:24):
She shares tips for people-pleasers like myself. Also, a lot of very concrete advice for how to get feedback. Also, what to do if your culture is on the ruinous empathy side of the spectrum, or even worse, obnoxious aggression and so much more. I guarantee listening to this episode will make you a better leader and a better employee. With that, I bring you Kim Scott after a short word from our one featured sponsor for this episode.

(00:03:13):
Kim, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:17):
Thank you for having me. I'm excited for our conversation.

Lenny (00:03:20):
Your book, Radical Candor is the single most recommended book on this podcast. I don't know if you know this podcast well, but at the end of the podcast, I ask every guest, "What are two or three books you recommend most to other people?" And your book has come up the most of any book mentioned on the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:37):
Amazing. Well, tell your listeners I love them and I'm grateful to them.

Lenny (00:03:45):
Okay, they'll hear this. So I'm really excited to have you on chat about all the things that you teach and your book. For people that have heard the term Radical Candor, have maybe skimmed the book, maybe even read the book a while ago, but don't truly remember or understand the concept. Could you just spend just a few minutes giving a high level overview of the concept of Radical Candor?

Kim Scott (00:04:04):
Absolutely. Radical Candor is just what happens when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time. And I think it's probably best understood by what it's not because we all fail on one of those two dimensions or both of them multiple times a day. So you can think about it as a two by two framework. On the vertical axis is care personally, the horizontal axis is challenge directly. What happens when we remember to challenge directly, but we forget to show that we care personally. That is what I call obnoxious aggression, and it's really important to distinguish between radical candor and obnoxious aggression. I think one of the mistakes that people often make about, and I've gotten a lot, you write a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it, and I've heard a lot of feedback that sometimes teams will be rolling out the idea of Radical Candor and someone will charge into the room and say, "In the spirit of Radical Candor," and then they act like a garden variety jerk.

(00:05:00):
And that is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That's the spirit of obnoxious aggression. And obnoxious aggression is a big problem. It's a problem because it hurts other people. It's also a problem because it's inefficient. If I'm a jerk to you Lenny, then I'm going to send you into fight or flight mode and then you literally cannot hear what I'm saying, so I'm wasting my breath. But I don't know if this is true for you, but for me, there's a third problem. And the third problem is that when I realize I've acted like a jerk, when I realize I've landed in obnoxious aggression, it's not actually my instinct to go the right way on care personally. Instead, it's my instinct to go the wrong way on challenge directly and to pretend that I agree when I disagree, and then I wind up in the worst place of all, manipulative insincerity.

(00:05:48):
And it's kind of fun to tell stories about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. If you watch The Office or any show about problems at work or problems in any kind of relationship really, you're going to see a lot of episodes about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. But I think the real rub comes and the fact that these, even though this is what we like to talk about, these two problems are what we like to talk about, these are not the most common problem. By far and away the most common problem occurs when we do remember to show that we care personally because you know what? Most people try to be nice people. So we do remember to show that we care personally, but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings or not offending them, that we fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run. And that is what I call ruinous empathy. So that is Radical Candor in a nutshell. That's the TLDR. But please do read.

Lenny (00:06:40):
Amazing and we'll link to a diagram of this two by two for people that aren't visual thinkers and want to actually see it. So just to make it super clear, if you're challenging directly, basically being very candid with feedback, but it's not clear you care deeply about the person, you call that obnoxious aggression.

Kim Scott (00:06:40):
Yes.

Lenny (00:06:57):
And if you make it clear, you care a lot about the person but aren't actually giving them direct candid feedback, you call that ruinous empathy.

Kim Scott (00:07:05):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:07:06):
Which of these buckets do you find most people fall into? Is there a percentage of people or companies?

Kim Scott (00:07:11):
Yeah, I mean, I would say 90% of us make 90% of our mistakes in that ruinous empathy bucket. It's by far and away the most common problem. But I think all of us make mistakes in the other quadrants as well. And very often we kind of, I think one of, if I'm going to offer some self-criticism of this framework, it's much easier to notice when one has been ruinously empathetic. It's almost like, give yourself some critical feedback. "I work too hard." But it's much harder to notice when we've been manipulatively insincere and obnoxiously aggressive. And maybe I could have named those things because very often manipulative insincerity is sort of self-protective insincerity. Very often obnoxious aggression is just extreme frustration. So I want people to use this framework not to judge themselves or other people harshly, but like a compass to guide specific conversations with specific people to a better place and to help us understand when we're going in the wrong direction, which we are all bound to do on a daily basis.

Lenny (00:08:26):
I want to talk about all those things and also how to get better at these things. But before we do that, it's very hard to change. And it's also hard just to challenge directly innately, it's hard for people to be candid, just to give people a little motivation to invest in this skill. What sort of impact do you see when people develop the skill of being better at radical candor?

Kim Scott (00:08:48):
When we get better at radical candor? I mean, I'll tell you a story in fact about the impact it had on my life, some radical candor, but the sort of abstract answer to your question is we build better relationships and we do better work and we're more successful and we're happier. You ready for a story? Let's do it. Love stories. Okay. So shortly after I joined Google, this was now a very long time ago, 2004, I had to give a presentation to the founders and the CEO about how the AdSense business was doing. And I walked into the room and there in one corner of the room was one of the founders on an elliptical trainer wearing toe shoes and a bright blue spandex unitard, super tight, not what I was expecting or frankly wanting to see in the room. And there in the other corner of the room was the CEO doing his emails like his brain had been plugged into the machine.

(00:09:49):
So probably like you in such a situation, I felt a little bit nervous. How was I supposed to get these people's attention? Luckily for me, the AdSense business was on fire. And when I said how many new customers we had added, the CEO almost fell off his chair. "What did you say? This is incredible. Do you need more engineers? Do you need more marketing dollars?" So I'm thinking the meeting's going all right. In fact, I now believe that I am a genius. And I walked out of the room, I walked past my boss and I was expecting a high five a pat on the back. And instead she said to me, "Why don't you walk back to my office with me?" And I thought, Oh gosh, I screwed something up in there and I'm sure I'm about to hear about it. And she began not by telling me what I had done wrong, but what had gone well in the meeting, not in the feedback sandwich.

(00:10:37):
I think there's a less polite term for that. I'm not sure how you feel about cussing on your podcast.

Lenny (00:10:37):
It's acceptable, fully acceptable.

Kim Scott (00:10:43):
Not in the shit sandwich since the word, but really seeming to mean what she said. But of course, all I wanted to do was hear about what I had done wrong. And eventually she said to me, "You said um a lot in there, were you aware of it?" And with this, I braved a huge sigh of relief if that was all I had done wrong who really cared. And I kind of made this brush off gesture with my hand. I said, "Yeah, I know, it's a verbal tech. It's no big deal, really." And then she said to me, "I know this great speech coach. I bet Google would pay for it. Would you like an introduction?" And once again, I made this brush off gesture with my hand.

(00:11:14):
I said, "Oh, I'm busy. I don't have time for a speech coach. Didn't you hear about all these new customers?" And then she said to me, "I can tell when you do that thing with your hand, then I'm going to have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid." Now she's got my full attention. And some people might say it was mean of her to say I sounded stupid, but in fact, it was the kindest thing that she could have done for me at that moment in my career because she knew me well enough to know that if she didn't use just those words with me, and by the way, this is a really important point, she never would've used those words with other people on her team who were perhaps a better listener than I was.

(00:11:56):
But she knew me well enough. She cared personally enough to know that if she didn't use those words with me, I never would've gone to visit the speech coach and I wouldn't have learned that she was not exaggerating. And this was news to me because I had raised millions of dollars for two different startups giving presentations. I thought I was pretty good at it. And it really got me to thinking sort of why had no one told me. It was almost like I suddenly realized I'd been marching through my whole career with a giant hunk of spinach in between my teeth and nobody had had the common courtesy to tell me it was there. So why had no one else told me. But what was it about her leadership style that made it so seemingly easy for her to tell me? And as I thought about that, I realized it really came down to those two things.

(00:12:41):
She cared personally and she challenged directly. She cared about me not just as an employee but as a human being. For example, when my father was diagnosed with late stage cancer, I was devastated and she could tell that I was devastated. And she said, "Kim, look, you go to the airport, fly home to Memphis, you need to be with your family. Your team and I will sit down and write your coverage plan." That's what great teams do for one another. And those were the kinds of things, that was the kind of thing that she did. She couldn't do, of course, for all 5,000 people in her organization, no matter how talented you are, relationships don't scale. But she did do those things for her direct reports and the people who she worked most closely with, all of us.

(00:13:27):
And when a leader treats their team, the people who they interact with on a day-to-day basis with that kind of real care, then it's much more likely that their direct reports in turn are going to treat their teams with real care. And that creates a culture of caring. And even though relationships don't scale, culture does scale. So that was part of it. But of course there's also this challenge directly part which is equally as important. And I learned very quickly beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I screwed up, she was going to tell me and she was going to keep telling me until it penetrated my sometimes thick skull.

Lenny (00:14:07):
I had a manager that was also very good at this. He was very good at just giving me very direct feedback, and I knew that he was only doing it because he cared about my future. To kind of follow this thread and get a little tactical, is there language or phrases or ways of communicating that you recommend people use to either challenge directly and avoid people getting defensive or make it clear you care deeply?

Kim Scott (00:14:31):
People always want me to give them a script. And the problem with the script is that if I write it, you're going to sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself. And then people won't really think you mean what you're saying. But I do think there are some important things to consider when having these conversations. I think you want to go into the conversation, and by the way, everything I'm about to say applies to praise as much as it does to criticism. And I want to pause for a moment. That story is helpful because that's the kind of thing that has happened to so many of us, that's not unique to me. However, praise is even more important than criticism in terms of radical candor. Radical candor is not all about the boss giving the employee criticism. It should always start with soliciting feedback and it should include more praise and criticism, but anyway, way without offering up shit sandwiches.

(00:15:31):
So anyway, I think that the important thing for these conversations, these sort of two-minute impromptu moments of management, is to go into the conversation being humble. To me, I call it candor and not truth because if I march into a room and I say, "Lenny, I'm going to tell you the truth." I'm kind of implying I've got a pipeline to God and you don't know anything. And that's not what this is all about. This is a dialogue, not a monologue. So to me, candor implies here's how I understand the situation. I'm also curious to know how you understand the conversation. So you want to go in being humble, you might be wrong, and that's totally fine. Omniscience is not a requirement for radical candor, thank heavens. So you want to be humble. You want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to remember in your own head and you want to make it explicit to the other person that you're telling them this to help them.

(00:16:25):
You're not trying to be dominant or kick them in the shins or anything like that. You're telling them this because you care about them. So you want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to have these conversations right away, almost immediately. I mean, there's exceptions to everything I'm saying. None of this is absolute. But usually if I'm telling myself and Lenny, you can tell me if you have the same problem, but if I tell myself, Oh, I'm going to wait for a better moment to tell this person this thing, what I'm really saying is I'm never going to say. So if the purpose of praise is to tell people what to do more of, and the purpose of criticism is to tell them what to do less of, why wait. So you want to do it immediately unless you are so upset that you're going to say it in a terrible way or the other person is so upset that they can't hear you. But usually that's not the case.

(00:17:16):
You also want, and in the before times I used to say have these conversations in person. Now I say have these conversations synchronously and I'm going to recommend phone over video. There's a lot of evidence coming out of University of Chicago and probably other places, but that's the article I've read that there's more noise than signal in facial expressions and body language, especially if somebody is just a little square on a computer screen. But it also may be true in real life, like the phone actually may be one of our best communication innovations of all time because when you're talking to someone on the phone, you're listening to the words that they are saying to you, and that is really what you want to do in this moment. So make sure that you're having these conversations synchronously, because what you want to do next is gauge how it's landing.

(00:18:15):
So I'll talk about that in a minute. And you can't gauge how something is landing if you're sending an email or a text, and Slack is just a feedback train wreck waiting to happen. I once coached someone who kept giving feedback over Slack and I finally just quit coaching him. I was like, "If you keep making this mistake, I can't be your coach." So don't do that. Take a moment to pick up the phone and call the person. Go back to those old AT&T commercials when I was a kid. Reach out and touch someone. You want to show you care.

(00:18:52):
So let's review. You want to be humble, you want to be helpful, you want to do it immediately. You want to do it in person or at least synchronously. If you can't do it in person. You also want to praise in public and criticize in private, and you don't want to give people either praise or criticism about their personality. So if you want to remember all that, it's HHIIPPP, two H's, two I's, kind of three P's depending on how you count.

(00:19:21):
And so let's double-click though on this not about personality point. I think it's really important to remember that for both praise and criticism, you want to use sort of context, observation, result, next step. So context, in the meeting, observation, when you said um every third word, result, it made you sound stupid. Next step, go to the speech coach. Also is important for praise, in the meeting context, when you offered both sides of the argument, observation, result is it earned you credibility. Next step is do more of that. So you can call it CORE, you can think about that as CORE. I used to call it CORN, but I got some feedback that corn is like some shorthand for porn on TikTok. So I call it CORE instead, HIP CORE.

Lenny (00:20:16):
Wow, that is amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. So the E at the end stands for?

Kim Scott (00:20:20):
Next step, big E.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Oh, I see the E is the next, you skipped the N, clever.

Kim Scott (00:20:26):
Yes. I don't know, clever or ridiculous. Maybe I should just call it HIP CORN,

Lenny (00:20:31):
Right? No, I think either one's great. So you share this example of the speaking example. Maybe if we can do another example just to reinforce this framework.

Kim Scott (00:20:43):
Let's do a little ruinous empathy.

Lenny (00:20:47):
Okay, great. Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:20:47):
How about that? That is the mistake. I think that I am really focused in the book Radical Candor and also in my next book Radical Respect. That's the mistake I really want to eliminate.

Lenny (00:21:00):
Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:21:00):
Because ruinous empathy creates this false harmony, which is really bad. So here's my ruinous empathy story. I had just hired this guy, we'll call him Bob, and I liked Bob a lot. He was smart, he was charming, he was funny. He would do stuff like we're at a manager offsite playing one of those endless get to know you games. And everybody was getting more and more and more stressed out. So start up, we've got a lot going on. And Bob was the guy who had the courage to raise his hand and to say, "I can tell everyone is getting stressed. I want to get to know all of you. I've got an idea. It'll help us do that and it'll be really fast."

(00:21:41):
Whatever his idea was, if it was really fast, we were down with it. And Bob says, "Let's just go around the table and confess what candy our parents used when potty training us." Really weird but really fast. And then for the next 10 months, every time there was a tense moment in a meeting, Bob would whip out just the right piece of candy for the right person at the right moment. And we all remember that was the weirder thing. Like Hershey Kisses right here. That was what my parents used to potty train me.

(00:22:16):
And so Bob was quirky, but he brought a little levity to the office. Everybody kind of loved working with Bob. There was one problem with Bob. He was doing terrible work. He would hand stuff into me and there was shame in his eyes. He kind of knew it wasn't good enough. He was very creative, but riddled with sloppy mistakes. And I would say something to Bob along the lines of, "Oh Bob, this is such a great start. You're so awesome. We all love working with you. Maybe you can make it just a little bit better." So let's pause for a moment. Why did I say such a banal thing to Bob? I think part of the problem was that I liked Bob and I really didn't want to hurt his feelings.

(00:23:05):
So that was the ruinous empathy part of why I said that. But also part of the problem was something more insidious, a little bit of manipulative insincerity, because Bob was popular and Bob was also sensitive kind of. And there was part of me that was afraid if I told Bob in no uncertain terms that his work wasn't nearly good enough, he would get upset. He might even start to cry and then everybody would think I was a big, you know what? So the part of me that was worried about my reputation as a leader, that was the manipulative insincerity part, the part of me that was worried about Bob's feelings, that was the ruinous empathy part. And this went on for 10 months, 10 long months, and I was so puzzled the whole time I couldn't understand what was going on. I learned much later that one of the issues perhaps was that Bob was smoking pot in the bathroom three times a day, which maybe explained all that candy that he had at all times.

(00:24:11):
But I didn't know any of that at the time. All I knew is that Bob was consistently doing bad work, but I wasn't really dealing with it. And eventually the inevitable happened. I realized that if I didn't fire Bob, I was going to lose all my best performers because not only had it been unfair to Bob not to tell him, I also had been unfair to everyone on the team. And they were frustrated. Their deliverables were late because his deliverables were late. They weren't able to do their best work because they were having to spend so much time redoing his work.

(00:24:46):
And the people who were best at their jobs were going to quit because they wanted to be able to do their best work. They were going to go to a different company where they could do their best work. And so I sat down to have a conversation with Bob that I should have begun frankly 10 months previously. And when I finished explaining to him where things stood, he kind of pushed his chair back from the table. He looked me right in the eye and he said, "Why didn't you tell me?" And as that question was going around in my head with no good answer, he looked at me again and he said, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me." And now I realized that by not telling Bob, thinking I was being so nice, I'm having to fire him as a result. Not so nice after all. But it was too late to say Bob because at this point even he agreed he should go because his reputation on the team was just shot.

(00:25:46):
All I could do in the moment was make myself a very solemn promise that I would never make that mistake again, and that I would do everything in my power to help other people avoid making that mistake. It was so painful. It was painful for me. It was painful for Bob, much more painful for Bob actually, and it was bad for the whole team and it was bad for our investors. We weren't getting results because of my ruinous empathy and ruinous empathy slash manipulative insincerity. It's much harder to admit the manipulative insincerity part. And that is really why I'm here talking to you because I want all of your listeners to avoid making that mistake because it's the most painful and the most common mistake that I think leaders and not just leaders, I mean all of us make this mistake in all of our relationships.

Lenny (00:26:41):
I love that this also gives an example of the impact of getting better at this point of you'll lose not just the people that are not necessarily great, but also other high performers on the team because they're seeing people slip through the cracks that aren't amazing. And if you're not practicing this early, your team basically becomes not high performing.

Kim Scott (00:27:00):
Yeah, exactly. You're going to lose your top performers. And I think very often people are afraid to tell someone on their team when their work isn't good enough because they're afraid of losing them. But that's not a good reason. You should be helping this person to improve. This person deserves to have a job where they can excel and you either help them excel on this team or you help them find a different job where they can excel, because everyone can do great work somewhere. And Bob could have done great work. Maybe I would've helped him keep it to the weekends because he's very creative and very smart, but the floppy mistakes just got in the way of his ability to do his best work.

Lenny (00:27:50):
So following that thread, I imagine the reason you didn't tell him early, and most people don't do this well, is many people are, you can maybe call them people pleasers. I'm a recovering people pleaser, I'll say. It's just hard to give people hard feedback. You want people to like you. It's not a natural state for a lot of people. What do you find helps people get over this kind of need to be liked as a leader and helps them be more candid?

Kim Scott (00:28:15):
I think that one of the things that was helpful for me anyway, so you can tell me if it's helpful for you, was realizing that my job was not to be liked. My job was to care about other people and to get out of my own head and to become others focused is what helped me kind of let go of the need to be liked. I think that also as a woman, I think there was something extra, as my teenage children would say, there was something extra for me because the sort of likability- competence bias that a lot of women face pushed me, especially early in my career, in the wrong direction on challenge directly.

(00:29:04):
And it made it much harder for me to, because often I would say something and I would say it even more gently than my colleagues who were men, but people would say, "Ah, Kim is a real whatever." And they weren't saying, Kim is obnoxious. I was being unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression and it wasn't obnoxious or they were accusing me of being bossy or or abrasive or whatever. And it's really hard. I would also say when it comes to eliciting feedback, it's really important to be open to it and it's really important to separate the wheat from the chaff from the feedback you're getting.

Lenny (00:29:41):
So in this example of Bob, say you were to do it now, what would you do differently other than give him feedback earlier? Is there something you've learned about just how you would've phrased it or approached it?

Kim Scott (00:29:58):
I think probably what I would do, and I would love to hear what you would've said to Bob too, I certainly don't have all the answers, but probably what I would've said is let's go back to the first time Bob handed work into me with shame in his eyes. I would've said, "Bob, maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression on your face, but it looks to me like you are not happy with this. What's going on?" And so I would've asked him to diagnose it himself and I want to pause on that because that can be very risky. He might have said to me, "I think this is awesome. This is my best work," and now I've kind of made my job of giving him feedback a little bit harder. So it's not always the right thing to ask questions, but I would've tried to ask it before I had examined the work when I noticed that he looked uncomfortable himself.

(00:30:47):
And I think also another thing I've learned about noticing, I said earlier that there's a lot of evidence that we often misinterpret each other's facial expressions and body language. So I would've tried to say that with some humility, it seems like you're not, maybe I'm wrong, but you don't look to me like you're happy with this. And I would've given him an opportunity to say, "Yeah, maybe I need to do it again." Let's imagine though that he said, "Oh no, it's awesome. It's ready." So then I get it and I look at it. I would have not been shy about pointing out very specifically every problem that I saw in that piece of work, every single one. Sometimes it can be tempting when you're giving someone feedback to say, "Oh, there's a number of careless mistakes here. Can you go back and look at it again," and the person will notice a few of them and then you got to go, sometimes it's useful to show someone a pattern.

(00:31:53):
All of the careless mistakes, especially if someone is defensive or if you think they're likely to be defensive, if you think they're likely to do to you what I did to my boss, oh no, everything's fine. It's no big deal. You need to move out on the challenge directly dimension. You need to be prepared to keep going until you have communicated with a person. And that was really the problem with Bob. He probably would not have started to cry. I think my fear around his tears was probably more about my fear than what was actually likely to happen. But I think we do fear someone else getting upset more often than they actually get upset. We have kind of a negativity bias when it comes to part of the reason why we're reluctant to give feedback.

Lenny (00:32:42):
And I think to your point, that we want to be liked, like you said, that you should get over that. I think that's obviously very hard just to be like, "Nah, I'm not going to worry about that." But I think your point is really important that you'll be liked later if you don't do the hard thing now. It'll only get worse if you just let it continue happening.

Kim Scott (00:33:01):
And I think also for me to say to myself going into that conversation, it's more important for me to demonstrate care, that I care about Bob than it is for Bob to like me, and if I demonstrate that I care about Bob, then I'm going to do the right thing that will ultimately create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob. Me pulling my punches did not create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob.

Lenny (00:33:31):
I actually did that and I learned this from a manager of mine is just almost work backwards from ask them, what do you want to achieve in your career? Where do you want to go in this company and make sure they know you know what they want, and then basically work backwards from to get there. Here's the things you need to get, and here's the thing you did recently that isn't necessarily on the track and here's what we should be working on if you want to get to the skull that you have.

Kim Scott (00:33:57):
Yeah, I think one of the really important things that all managers can do for their direct reports to show that they care is to have real meaningful career conversations, where you talk about their life story, sort of their past, whatever part of it they're comfortable talking to you about so that you understand what motivates them at work. And I would have three separate 45 minute conversations, so one about their past, one about their future, their dreams for the future, and it's not just the next couple of years. It's like imagine at the height of your career you have everything you want. What does it look like? And give me three or four different pictures of that because very few of us know what we want to do when we grow up.

(00:34:40):
Then the third conversation is to sort of sit down with your director report and come up with a career action plan. So given what motivates you and where you want to go, what are the skills that it would be useful for you to develop so that you can get where you want to go and who can I introduce you to? What are the educational opportunities? Can we tweak your job so that you're gaining those skills so you're at least taking a step in the direction of your dreams, even if you're not there yet?

Lenny (00:35:11):
Awesome. I have a post about this. I'll link to in the show notes that gives people a guide to having these conversations, and there's a spreadsheet I share with people like, here's an action plan you can come up with your teammate and here's what you're going to work on these next six months.

Kim Scott (00:35:24):
Did you read the book When they Win, You Win by Russ Laraway?

Lenny (00:35:24):
No.

Kim Scott (00:35:29):
Oh, he has a hundred pages on career conversations and he's also built sort of some tools that help people. So check that out.

Lenny (00:35:39):
And it's called When You Win... When They Win, You Win.

Kim Scott (00:35:41):
When They Win, You Win.

Lenny (00:35:42):
Amazing.

Kim Scott (00:35:42):
Yes, by Russ Laraway, he and I worked together at Google and then we started a company together.

Lenny (00:35:48):
Oh wow. Okay, cool. We'll link to them in the show notes. Maybe I'll get him on the podcast too. Great.

Kim Scott (00:35:51):
Yeah, he'd be great.

Lenny (00:35:53):
Okay, so we've been chatting about ways individually to get better at some of these skills. Another area that I think people struggle with is the company culture often isn't welcoming of direct feedback. So there's a question, so you probably saw this on Twitter. I asked people, what should I ask you? And a lot of people came in with a lot of questions and there's one that came in from Pete, so I'm just going to read it along these lines. So this question is just how do you practice being radically candid in a culture? And most cultures are like this where people aren't ready for direct feedback. Since company culture is often closer to ruinous empathy and being radically candid is more of a long-term good than a short-term good. You could potentially risk retention with your employees if you're too direct with them. So how do you think about finding this balance of being candid but not pissing people off, or do you just hire people that are open and ready for direct feedback and that's kind of how you solve that problem?

Kim Scott (00:36:45):
I don't think you can only hire people who are open and ready for direct feedback because it's hard for all of us. I just want to acknowledge that, it's hard for me. I mean, I wrote the book, I believe in it to my core and sometimes it's still hard for me. It's hard for me to hear it and it's hard for me to deliver it. This is a really difficult thing to do. The good thing about that two by two is it makes it look easy, which is useful, but it's not easy. So anyway, I think there are, to answer Pete's question, I think there are a few things that can help. There's really an order of operations to radical candor, and if you begin with soliciting criticism, then you take the first and most important step to improving your relationship with that person enough that it becomes easier for you to give it as well as to get it.

(00:37:35):
So I want to leave folks with some sort of steps on how to solicit feedback, and this is true, especially if you're a boss, but it's true in all your relationships. You can use this at home as well. So if you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." Nobody in your life accepts your teenage children. If you have teenage children, they'd really want to give you some criticism, but nobody else in your life really wants to give you criticism. And so you want to think about how you're going to ask the person that's going to be most likely to elicit a response. The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" But do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you.

(00:38:33):
I was working with Christa Quarles when she was CEO of OpenTable and she said, "Kim, I could never imagine those words coming out of my mouth." She said, "The way I like to ask is tell me why I'm wrong." Okay, that's fine too. It demands an answer to her question. But of course there were a couple of people on her team who felt that that was too aggressive, that shut them down, so she had to adjust her question. Being authentic does not mean ignoring the impact you're having on others. So you want to think about your question, you want to think about who you're going to ask that question of, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:39:22):
Let's spend more time on this actually. So what is it you recommend, that they pick? How many people would you recommend they pick, and ask feedback from?

Kim Scott (00:39:28):
Well, I think if you are a manager, you need to be soliciting every week feedback from each of your direct reports, and you need to sort of, I would budget five minutes at the end of your one-on-one to solicit feedback. So mostly a one-on-one should be your employees setting the agenda and your employee's time and don't by the way, save up when you have to give feedback. Don't save it up for your one-on-one and definitely don't save it up for a performance review. You want to give that in the moment. We can talk more about that in a second, but when you're soliciting feedback, save five minutes at the end of your one-on-one and ask that go-to question. And you also want to ask that go-to question of your cross-functional peers who you work most closely with and of your boss. And I think you don't want to ask the same question every single time. It'll start to sound like you don't really want the answer, but you want to make this part of your daily weekly routine with the people who you interact most closely with.

Lenny (00:40:34):
So you added to the end of this your one-on-one agenda, and two versions of this question are, what am I doing wrong? Which is that one I guess you iterated.

Kim Scott (00:40:43):
Tell me why I'm wrong or what am I doing wrong or what could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me? Or what should I stop doing? What should I start doing? What should I continue doing? Those are some common ones. What do you like to ask Lenny?

Lenny (00:41:00):
I think it was something along the lines of like, what's one thing I could be doing better or what's one way I could be helping you be more successful?

Kim Scott (00:41:07):
That's a really good one. What's one way I could help you be more successful? Or Jason Rosoff, my co founder at Radical Candor likes to ask, "What could I have done this week?" So he time, he time bounds it. "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" In fact, Jason told me after we had worked together for about a month, he was like, "Kim, I really hate your go-to question." He said, "It's too open-ended for me. If you can tell me what you're working on and ask me at the end of a meeting specifically what I noticed then that is much better."

Lenny (00:41:48):
How often do you accept no answer? Just like, no everything's great.

Kim Scott (00:41:52):
Never,

Lenny (00:41:53):
Never,

Kim Scott (00:41:53):
Never. I mean, there are some people who really don't like to be put on the spot. So if I can tell that I'm inflicting a cruel and unusual punishment on the person, I'll say, "Look, you know I'm not perfect. I know I'm not perfect. Next time we meet, I want you to think of something, notice something. It's the thing that you can do that would help me more than anything else that you could do is to tell me when I'm wrong because I need to know that." In fact, Andy Grove, who was the CEO of Intel said he used to at the end of his one-on-ones say to people, "There's one more thing. And he explained to me that that was coded Intel for like this is the most important thing." I was working at Apple at the time and I said, "Oh, did you get that from Steve Jobs?"

(00:42:47):
That was always how he introduced, "Just one more thing, the iPad." And Andy got immediately very grumpy and very offended, and he said, "No, we both got it from Colombo. The detective show." You can get tips from anywhere. So you want to make sure that you're though letting the person know that you really do care about what they say and that it's really when they give you this critical feedback that you're going to reward it. But that's not the end. Asking that question is only the first step, the bad news about your question, no matter how hard you think about it, and no matter how good a question it is, the other person is still going to feel uncomfortable. There's no such thing as emotional Novocaine. That's why I don't believe in scripts. People believe if I just say the magic words like the door will open, that's not how it works. It's a give and take. So you want to sort of be prepared to embrace that discomfort. The only way out is through. Simplest way to embrace the discomfort is to close your mouth and count to six.

(00:43:59):
Only made it to three just there, and your eyes were popping out.

Lenny (00:44:03):
That is so long.

Kim Scott (00:44:04):
Six seconds is a really long time. Almost nobody can endure six full seconds of silence. So they'll probably tell you something. So now you've dragged this poor soul out on a conversational limb that they never wanted to go on. They're probably going to say something. The third step is to make sure that you listen with the intent to understand not to respond, because you're probably going to feel defensive and that's okay. It doesn't mean you're a lesser mortal or that you're shut down the feedback. All it means is that you're human. And that's all part of this. You want to figure out how to manage your natural defensive reaction to critical feedback, which you're probably going to have. The simplest tactic I can offer folks there is to think of some follow-up questions.

(00:44:56):
So at breakfast, my daughter not too long ago said to me, "Mom, I wish you weren't the Radical Candor lady." And immediately this wave of parental guilt washed over me and I thought, ah, I'm spending too much time at work. She wants more of my time. I shouldn't be traveling so much. But then I thought, well, I should ask her, make sure I understood. I'm jumping to conclusions here. I'm not listening with the intent to understand. So I asked a follow-up question. I said, "Well, who do you wish I were?" And she said, "I wish you were the lady who minded her own business," so I could go spend a little more time at work as far as she was concerned. So you want to make sure you really understand what a person is telling you. And once you feel certain that you really do understand and that you've been open to it, the last and most important step is to reward the candor.

(00:45:46):
A person takes a huge risk, especially if this person is your employee. A person takes a huge risk to give you critical feedback. And if you do not reward that risk richly, you're never going to get any feedback again. So if you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your listening tangible, be loud. So-and-so told me that the tea in the break room is terrible, and now we have thirty-five different kinds of tea. Thank you for telling me. And that can demonstrate to people that they're not wasting their breath to come to you. That if you become aware of a problem, you'll fix it. And you also want to, by the way, you want to ask for feedback after you fixed it. Did I over-correct or did I under-correct?

(00:46:31):
My boss at Google, the same boss from the um story also told me when she gave me some feedback that I tended to move too fast. And she said, "Kim, until people and giving you feedback that you're going too slow. You won't have corrected this problem." So you kind of want to shoot to over-correct if you get some critical feedback. I also want to though pause on what to do when you get some critical feedback that you disagree with because it can be easy to feel wedged here. And if all you do is say thank you for the feedback, the other person is going to hear something much less polite than a brush off or worse.

(00:47:10):
And so what you want to do is you want to look for that five or 10% of whatever the person said that you can agree with, and you want to give voice to that. And then what you want to do is you want to say, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you." And then you've got to get back to them. You got to offer a respectful explanation of why you disagree. And it's tempting to feel like a disagreement poses a risk to our relationships, but it's not disagreement that poses a risk to our relationships. It's unspoken disagreement. Many, I don't know about you Lenny, but a lot of my best professional relationships began with a good respectful disagreement.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Interesting. That reminds me of just watching Squid Games, the reality show on Netflix. Yeah. Have you seen this at all?

Kim Scott (00:47:56):
I haven't watched it, but it's on my list.

Lenny (00:47:59):
There's this guy who makes a huge bad decision on behalf of his whole team and they hate him in the show. And then on TikTok, he shared that they're best friends now, even though they called him a big idiot.

Kim Scott (00:48:09):
Yeah, no.

Lenny (00:48:09):
So funny.

Kim Scott (00:48:10):
It can happen for sure.

Lenny (00:48:12):

(00:49:32):
So to recap the steps roughly for how to get feedback from people, it's ask your question like what's one thing I could have done this week to make you more successful? Wait six seconds potentially or try to, it's very hard. Ask a few follow-up questions to make sure you understand what they're saying and then find a way to reward them. Say thank you.

Kim Scott (00:49:53):
Do more than say thank you.

Lenny (00:49:55):
Especially if you disagree, which is a really interesting nuance of this. I had Jules Walter on the podcast. I always think of him when I think of getting feedback. He shared this advice. When you get feedback, just be so appreciative so that people keep giving me just like, "Thank you so much for that feedback." The way he phrases it. Even if you're melting inside and really hate this feedback, just like, "thank you, I really appreciate it." But I think your nuance there is really key is if you do disagree, I really like this tip of just like, let me think about this element of it and then actually follow up.

Kim Scott (00:50:25):
Even if you're melting inside, if you say thank you and you're melting inside, I mean maybe it's a terrible actor, but usually people know. And that's why I say it's not enough to say thank you. You got to fix the problem and then show what you did to fix the problem and get more feedback. Did I over-correct? Did I under-correct. And if you disagree, you got to say that you disagree, but you got to say, so respectfully.

Lenny (00:50:48):
As a leader, this sounds like a lot of work to be doing every week. If you have a one-on-one following up correcting things. Is there anything you'd recommend there? Or is it just, this is really important, you got to make time.

Kim Scott (00:50:58):
It's not as much work as failing to do this as we saw from the Bob story. So I think that the important thing that I have found is that this is part of why it's so important to do it immediately. It's important for the other person, but it's also important for you. If you're doing this in a one-on-one, which you should be having anyway. So you're saving some time in a one-on-one. So it's not adding time necessarily to your day. And when you hear about problems, you should fix them. Yes, it takes time, but that is your job. And when you disagree with something, you can disagree in your next regularly scheduled one-on-one. So I'm not talking about adding meetings to your calendar, so it doesn't actually take more time. I have found that in fact, it saves tremendous amounts of time, but it does take emotional discipline.

(00:51:52):
And I think it also requires you, especially when it comes to giving it, which we talked about before, where the humble, helpful, those are impromptu two-minute conversations, giving the feedback that you should be having in between your meetings. In the um story, walk to my meeting with me, it didn't take any extra time for my boss to give me that feedback. She had to walk to her meeting anyway, and I had to go in the same direction. So it didn't even take extra time from me. But it is, I think one of the most common reasons why people don't do this in addition to fear of retaliation and just sort of existential dread, which are both factors, which hopefully we've helped alleviate, but is that you're scheduled back to back to back and you don't have those two minutes in between meetings.

(00:52:42):
And that's why I think it's important either to schedule slack time in your calendar, make your 30 minute meetings, 25 minute meetings, make your hour-long meetings, 50 minute meetings, maybe give yourself a few breaks in the day. But if it's not possible, and often it was not possible for me in my career to sort of schedule my time that way, I just decided that these moments of management were more important than being on time to my next meeting. And so I was just late sometimes. So I wish I had a better answer than either control your time, which is really annoying advice because it's impossible to follow or be willing to be late to your next meeting. But those were the things that I tried to do.

Lenny (00:53:34):
That was super helpful. I think your point of just, if you're not making two minutes to do this thing now, it'll be a lot more time intensive later.

Kim Scott (00:53:40):
Oh yeah. It's stitch in time takes nine on all these two minute, and really it should be brushing and flossing. This is not like a root canal. These are like, this is relationship hygiene that you should be doing all the time.

Lenny (00:53:55):
I was just reading Charlie Munger's book and there's a quote that he references of just the classic, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Kim Scott (00:54:03):
Yes, absolutely.

Lenny (00:54:04):
Same idea. So we've talked about a leader getting feedback. What if you're the employee? Do you also recommend the same thing in the one-on-one, have an agenda item and ask this question? Or is there a different approach you'd recommend?

Kim Scott (00:54:16):
I think yes, if you're the employee, you should also be soliciting feedback on a regular basis from your boss. So there's sort of an order of operations you want to solicit at first, no matter who you are, it's the same up, down, and sideways, even though it feels very different, the order of operations is the same. So start by soliciting feedback. Then you want to give both praise and criticism. I think sometimes it feels like you're kissing up if you give your boss praise, but bosses need praise too. And if there are things that your boss does that you appreciate and you want your boss to do more of those things, praise is a better tool for that than criticism. When it comes time to offering your boss some critical feedback, you want to make sure, and by the way, this is also true when it comes time to give your employee critical feedback or your spouse or anybody else in your life, you want to be sure that you are prepared to gauge how it lands.

(00:55:09):
So you want to start in kind of a neutral place. You don't want to go to the outer edge of challenge directly because then you're going to wind up in obnoxious aggression. So if we go back to that story, my boss started, "You said um a lot, were you aware of it?" "Nah." That was my response. And then "I know this great speech coach, would you like an introduction?" "Nah," was my response. So she had to keep going out on that challenge directly. She didn't start out by saying, "When you say um I'm every third word, it makes you sound stupid." But she realized she had to go that far. So you want to keep going out if you think they're brushing you off. But if you find that your boss looks either sad or mad, that is your cue to move up on the care personally dimension.

(00:55:51):
And so to take a moment, and if you find your employee looks sad or mad, if they look sad, pause and say, "I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?" And so that means you're going up on the care personally, dimension, but you're not going the wrong way on challenge directly. I don't know about you Lenny, but if I say something to someone and they look sad, it's so tempting for me to try to pull the words back. "Oh no, it's no big deal. I didn't mean it," but it is a big deal, and I did mean it, that's why I just said it. And so if you go the wrong way on challenge directly, you wind up in ruinous empathy, and then you leave the person both sad and confused, so you make it worse.

(00:56:34):
So you want to take a beat to pay attention to the emotions in the moment, but not to go the wrong way on challenge directly. Same thing if they're mad, although if somebody's mad, that maybe is even harder. If somebody starts yelling at me, it's tempting for me either to start yelling back and wind up in obnoxious aggression or to crawl off to a self-protective, manipulative insincerity. And so instead, what I try to do is get curious, not furious, and why is this person so mad? So say like, Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue and we need to resolve it.

Lenny (00:57:14):
This comes back to the point you made about when you're giving feedback to try to do it in person or on a phone call to do exactly what you're saying, to read them as you're giving this feedback and figure out which axis you want to go down.

Kim Scott (00:57:25):
Yeah, you want to gauge it. I mean, when we communicate with other people, we communicate on an emotional level and on an intellectual level at the same time. And if we ignore the emotional signals that are coming at us or say don't take it personally, then we're just not going to communicate very well.

Lenny (00:57:43):
Along these same lines, another question that came in is from a coach of yours that works I think for you or somehow with the program. She asked this question of many top leaders have very low self-awareness. They believe obnoxious aggression is the only way to give feedback, or they just ignore the problem and fire people with no feedback. Is there something you've learned about how to change their mind about this is the way to operate?

Kim Scott (00:58:05):
Yeah, I think the most important thing with leaders like that, that you can do is to explain to them the impact that they're having and to also show them that there is another way that is going to help them succeed. Very often the leaders who are low on the care personally dimension, they do care about their results and they do care about their own careers. And so when you sort of explain this to them in terms of enlightened self-interest, they tend to get better at it. And also, I mean there I can think of maybe one or two people I've worked with who are truly low on care, who truly don't care. Very often people are bad at showing they care, but they do actually care. And also sometimes there are leaders who think they're not supposed to care. And so unleashing that capacity that they innately have to care and telling them this is actually part of the job can make them a much better, more effective leader. But look, if someone is a psychopath and they truly don't care, they shouldn't be a manager. That's the solution.

Lenny (00:59:27):
I totally get that one. So I really like that takeaway. Just basically show them the impact they're having because to your point, they want the company to succeed. They want their team to succeed. And if they're not realizing there's downsides to the way they're operating.

Kim Scott (00:59:38):
And they want themselves to succeed. That's why I say part of the problem with obnoxious aggression is that you harm other people, but it's also inefficient because when you act like that, people can't hear what you're saying, so you're wasting your breath.

Lenny (00:59:56):
And the way you show them that impact. Do you recommend interviewing people, getting stories, seeing, I don't know, how do you collect this impact so that they're like, oh, wow, I didn't realize this.

Kim Scott (01:00:07):
I think that the best thing to do is, for me anyway, is I start by sharing stories from my career and stories when I was a jerk. I've acted like a jerk too, plenty of times, unfortunately. And I show the impact that I've had and then I ask them for a similar story. And usually sort of me holding up the mirror to myself is useful for them to be able to hold the mirror up to themselves to realize you want to help these people adopt a growth mindset around this stuff. I am not telling you that you're an asshole. I'm telling you that we all behave like assholes sometimes. And it's a big problem for us as well as for the people around us. And here's my story, when I acted like a jerk, what's yours? And people, that kind of self-awareness, sometimes people talk about inflicted insight like it's some kind of burden, but usually that kind of self-awareness makes people feel lighter. They're like, "Ah, now I know what's wrong and now I know what I can do about it."

Lenny (01:01:14):
Yeah, I've definitely noticed that about your stories. They always are you making the mistake, which I think is very disarming.

Kim Scott (01:01:20):
We all make mistakes.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Yeah. Maybe the extreme of this obnoxious aggressiveness is Bridgewater. Their whole approach is like theirs.

Kim Scott (01:01:31):
Oh my gosh. Did you read the book The Fund?

Lenny (01:01:34):
No, not yet.

Kim Scott (01:01:35):
You must read it. It's all about Bridgewater. I always thought it was problematic. I had no idea just how problematic it is. Put that book in the show notes one of the best business books I've read in the last decade.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Wow, that is high praise. Yes, I will read that. And so I guess for people that aren't familiar, like Bridgewater, they encourage, they have a system called Dots where they tell people, you must give hard critical feedback after every meeting, publicly.

Kim Scott (01:02:01):
Not after the meeting, in the meeting, publicly. And it's recorded on, it was, I think they changed it since, but it was recorded for posterity on video. And sometimes, in fact, true story, shortly after I left Google, I was approached to work at Bridgewater in a management capacity, not in an investment capacity. And so I called someone I knew who worked there and he said, "Let me give you an anecdote." He said, "The other day there was a meeting and there was a woman who in the meeting who had made a mistake and everybody just piled on. The criticism was very personal. There was no core about the criticism. It was like, these are your personality attributes that make you a useless human being. Kind of terrible feedback until she started to cry and the whole meeting was recorded and then they emailed a recording of the meeting out to the whole company, including all the people who were not in the meeting saying, this is an example of how to have..." So I would say that is deep, dark, obnoxious aggression. That is not radical candor. That is horrible.

Lenny (01:03:24):
So it's safe to say you're not a fan of that approach?

Kim Scott (01:03:26):
No. In fact, I did an analysis of Dalio's book Principles and it's like a, I don't know, 3 or 400 page book. And there were I think four or five pages about caring about people. There's very low care personally.

Lenny (01:03:44):
I imagine many people see that, they see Elon, they see Steve Jobs, and the perception is they're very challenge directly people, they're not clearly care about you people, but they're very successful. What do you say to people that are like, but it works. Why wouldn't I be that if that's the way I want to do it?

Kim Scott (01:04:00):
Well, first of all, I would not put Steve Jobs in the same category as Ray Dalio and Elon Musk. I mean, Steve Jobs could be obnoxiously aggressive, but mostly I would say he built such good relationships with his direct reports that when he got cancer, Tim Cook offered to give him half his liver. And I don't know of a word to describe that other than love. These were real human relationships. When I worked at Apple, you could see Steve and Johnny talking. You could tell these people cared about each other. Now, radical candor gets measured not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear. And I think that Steve had built a team around him of people who didn't mind rather what other people would consider obnoxious aggression. But I think in the context of their relationship, it was understood as care.

(01:05:03):
I'll give you an example of that from my own career, not that I am comparing myself to Steve Jobs, I think I'm a much gentler person, but sometimes I develop relationships with people. And part of that relationship is that we push each other pretty hard. So there was a person who I had worked with for a long time, for many years. He had followed me from one company to another, and we were localizing a product and he kept conflating Slovakia and Slovenia, and I corrected him once. I corrected him twice the third time, I was like, did Slovakia, not Slovenia dumb ass.

(01:05:44):
And he started laughing, and that was fine in the context of our relationship, but I realized that the people around me, I was silencing them. They were like, "Oh my gosh, I don't want to make a mistake. Kim's going to call me a dumb ass." So I had to pause and say, "Look, I respect this person enormously, and I like this person enormously. We work very well together." And so I think that sometimes people have relationships with others and they have those relationships in public and other people misinterpret those relationships.

(01:06:19):
Steve Jobs was not perfect. He made all kinds of mistakes, but he was no Ray Dalio or Elon Musk, who I would say make far more and worse and more egregious mistakes. And I think you're raising a really important point. You're raising a point, which is that there's this false dichotomy. In fact, the new biography of Elon Musk falls into this category. I like Walter Isaacson's work a lot, but he falls prey to this in his biography of Elon Musk, which is there's this notion that we have to choose between being a total jerk but really competent or really nice but incompetent. And those are not our two choices. That's the whole point of radical candor is that there's this other way that works better and doesn't hurt people.

Lenny (01:07:13):
I think that's the key takeaway there is you can be even more successful if you lean into the care deeply. In theory, they could have gotten more out of their people if they made it clear they really care about them.

Kim Scott (01:07:26):
And there's plenty of counter examples of incredibly successful people who are very caring leaders, and it's not as much fun to tell stories about that. And so we don't as often.

Lenny (01:07:40):
Along the same lines, there's someone that you worked with that suggested I ask you about investing in your authentic leadership style, Melissa Tan. I don't know if you remember her.

Kim Scott (01:07:50):
Yes.

Lenny (01:07:51):
Okay, great. And she was on the podcast in the past, and she just said how when she met you, she was a very people-pleasery person and just wanted to be like, and you helped her develop her natural leadership style. Can you just talk about what you suggest to people to figure this out and how to find that for yourself?

Kim Scott (01:08:06):
I mean, I wonder what Melissa would say, but my memory of conversations with her, and this is an issue that I talk about a lot because a people pleaser too. I grew up in the South and I'm a woman. I was not brought up to challenge directly. That was not part of the culture that I was brought up in. I was brought up to be polite but also brought up to be kind. And for me, the thing that is most important to hang on to is that fundamental kindness and to realize that it's actually unkind not to say the thing. And so that is part of the reason why I encourage people. I tell the Bob story so often and I encourage other leaders who I work with to think about what their Bob story is that you realize it's not nice in the long run.

(01:09:00):
It's unkind in the long run, not to tell someone if they're making a mistake. There's nothing nice about that in the long run. And so that I think at least for me, that's been helpful. And then another thing that is helpful is again, to get others focused, to focus not on pleasing people, but on doing the right thing for those people, on truly caring about those people more than you care about your own discomfort in the moment. And that is something that is easier for people to do than just to challenge directly. I think in many ways it's about what is getting in the way. That's why I call it ruinism. Empathy is a good thing, but sometimes empathy can paralyze at least me because I'm so acutely aware of how what I'm going to say might impact the other person, might hurt their feelings that I don't say it.

(01:10:01):
And so when I push myself to be, and you can call it compassionate candor if you like that better than radical candor. But when I push myself not to feel so acutely what I think the other person might feel, and by the way, I could be wrong about what I think the other person might often, they're like, it's no big deal. They're like, oh, thank you for letting me know. But when I can let go of that and think about the other person and what I care about and what they care about for their future, going back to your point, if you know that it's really important for someone to get promoted and they won't get promoted if they keep talking to people in a particular way, then you're focused on what they want. That is really helpful to move past that.

Lenny (01:10:47):
Just a few more questions before we wrap up. Your book sold something like half a million copies.

Kim Scott (01:10:47):
A million now.

Lenny (01:11:00):
A million copies.

Kim Scott (01:11:00):
Million copies. Million in 23 languages. Yes.

Lenny (01:11:00):
23 languages. I had a stat of 20 languages. Jesus Christ. So a lot of people have read it, a lot of people have been using it. What's something that people often just get wrong that super frustrates you about the system, the recommendations that you just wish people come on, here's what I really wanted to say, or here's what you should change.

Kim Scott (01:11:17):
There's two things. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, when you write about a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it. One is this, in the spirit of Radical Candor and then the person acts like a jerk. That is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That is the spirit of obnoxious aggression. But shortly after the book came out, I was giving a talk at a tech company in San Francisco and I got some feedback from the CEO of that company that was so impactful that it caused me to write my next book, which is called Radical Respect. And in many ways, Radical Respect is kind of the prequel to Radical Candor because if you don't respect the other person, it's impossible to care about them and you're not going to bother challenging them directly. So what happened in this meeting? I walked in, I was really excited to give this talk.

(01:12:04):
The CEO had been a colleague of mine for the better part of a decade. She's a person I like and respect enormously, and she's one of too few black women CEOs in tech or in any other sector. And when I finished giving the talk, she pulled me aside and she said, "Kim, I'm excited to roll out Radical Candor. I think it's really going to help me build the kind of career I want." But she said, "I got to tell you, it's much harder for me to roll it out than it is for you." And she went on to explain to me that as soon as she would offer folks even the most gentle, compassionate criticism, they would call her an angry black woman. And I knew this was true as soon as she said it, and I knew how unfair it was because she's like one of the most even keeled, cheerful people I've ever worked with.

(01:12:49):
And I realized a bunch of things at the same time when she told me that, the first was that I had not been the kind of colleague that I aspire to be, that I imagined myself to be. I had failed even to notice the extent to which she had to show up unfailingly, cheerful and pleasant in every meeting we had ever been in together even though she had what to be ticked off about as we all do at work. So I had failed to be an upstander, a good colleague. The second thing I realized was that I had also failed to acknowledge when I was experiencing different versions of bias, prejudice and bullying. And I think part of the reason it's kind of hard for the author of a book called Radical Candor to admit she was in denial. But I had been in denial about a bunch of experiences I had had in the workplace.

(01:13:41):
I had pretended that a whole host of things were not happening, that were in fact happening. And I think part of the reason why I did that was that I never wanted to think of myself as a victim, but even less than wanting to think of myself as a victim did I want to think of myself as the culprit. So I'd been even more deeply in denial about the times that I had said or done things that hurt other people who I worked with, said or done things that were biased or worse. I had bullied people before. And by the way, when you become a leader, you're much more prone to bullying even if you don't think of yourself as a bully, which I certainly don't think of myself as a bully, but that doesn't mean I never bullied anyone. And then the last thing I realized was that as a leader, I imagined that I was creating these BS free zones, but I had allowed all manner of BS to pass. So that was what prompted me to write the next book, Radical Respect, which you can pre-order right now and please do.

Lenny (01:14:41):
That was my next question. Talk more about this book. What is it about? Where people find it?

Kim Scott (01:14:46):
Radical Respect comes out in May. You can pre-order it now. Anywhere you buy books, at your local independent bookstore, I'm speaking at a conference of independent bookstore owners soon you can pre-order it on Amazon or Barnes Noble or anywhere else you buy buy books.

Lenny (01:15:05):
And who would you say it's most for?

Kim Scott (01:15:08):
So there are chapters in that book about things leaders can do. There are chapters in the book about things you can do if you're harmed by bias, prejudice, or bullying. There are chapters in the book about how to be a great upstander, how to be a better colleague, and there are chapters in the book about how to become part of the solution, not part of the problem when you're the culprit. And I think we all find ourselves in all four of those roles at different moments in time, and I don't think there's any one group who can solve this problem. Everyone is responsible for creating a more respectful work environment.

Lenny (01:15:48):
Awesome. We'll link to that in the show notes.

Kim Scott (01:15:50):
Amazing.

Lenny (01:15:51):
To leave people with a very tactical next step. What's one thing they could do this week today to get better at Radical Candor, to start building that muscle?

Kim Scott (01:16:00):
I would love it if everyone would write down their go-to question what are the words that will come out of your mouth and practice it. Practice it in front of the mirror and then practice it with a friend and refine it. Just figure out what, because it is uncomfortable to solicit feedback from others. They don't want to give it to you and you don't really want to hear it. So if everybody can write down their go-to question and then put five minutes in your calendar of someone you're going to ask that question of.

Lenny (01:16:31):
And that calendar entry, I was going to come back to it actually. So you do the one-on-one agenda, adding the question, the calendar entry is for people you don't have a one-on-one with, pick someone that you're going to ask that you're not meeting with regularly.

Kim Scott (01:16:42):
Absolutely. Or add it to the bottom of your next one-on-one agenda. That's fair too. Either one.

Lenny (01:16:44):
Amazing. Kim, is there anything else you want to leave folks with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kim Scott (01:16:52):
I think just remember, you do not have to choose between being successful and being a jerk. You can be a successful kind person.

Lenny (01:17:00):
Oh, I love that. Amazing. Okay, well with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kim Scott (01:17:07):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:17:08):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? You've already mentioned a few but what do you want to share?

Kim Scott (01:17:14):
Yes, I've mentioned a couple. Please do buy Radical Respect, I believe that the more novels people read, the better. People often ask me, what can I do to move up on the care personally dimension of Radical Candor and read more novels? This is the best way I know of to build compassion for other people, to understand the emotional signals that might be coming at you. I mean, some of my favorite novels are Middlemarch. I try to reread that all the time. Anything that Toni Morrison wrote, the Bluest Eye is one of my favorite, but also Song of Solomon. It just such a brilliant writer and will help you enter into the lives of people that you haven't entered into. I think that Orlando by Virginia Woolf is another one of my favorites. And Robertson Davies, the Deptford Trilogy is an incredible set of novels to read. I'm cheating now and giving you three.

Lenny (01:18:27):
The more the merrier.

Kim Scott (01:18:27):
Yes, Alice Walker, the Color Purple is another one of my very favorite books, so I recommend reading more novels.

Lenny (01:18:34):
I love this leaning into fiction that doesn't come up often on this podcast, so this is great. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Kim Scott (01:18:47):
I watched all 19 seasons of Grey's Anatomy with my daughter during and after COVID. That was really fun.

Lenny (01:18:55):
Actually. I did the same thing with my wife. We didn't do all the seasons, but we watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy.

Kim Scott (01:18:59):
We watched every single one. It's still coming out.

Lenny (01:19:04):
Yeah, it's funny to see which characters continue and which I die off, leave.

Kim Scott (01:19:07):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:19:09):
Oh man. Okay. Funny

Kim Scott (01:19:10):
And Shonda Rhimes, I mean, watch her TED Talk, amazing person.

Lenny (01:19:14):
All right, we'll link to that in the show notes. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people that might be helpful to folks interviewing?

Kim Scott (01:19:22):
The question that I like to ask is just tell me the story of your career. And I know that's kind of, maybe it's a hard, it seems like a softball, but it's actually can be unfairly hard or not. I don't know, unfairly hard, but I always learn a lot about people from how they tell the story of their life and their career. And then what I try to do is they'll say a couple of things that really interest me and I sort of double-click down into the details of a couple of aspects. I love people's life stories, so that makes it a more fun conversation for me. Often people like talking about themselves so it's not too painful for them, but you also learn all kinds of unexpected things.

Lenny (01:20:13):
And is there anything you're looking for in an answer that's like, this is a good person to hire or is it mostly information? I'm just gathering a lot of background.

Kim Scott (01:20:22):
I find that I learn how the person approaches setbacks from a story, from the way they tell a story. I learn whether a person is able to identify mistakes they made. I mean, if you say, "Tell me the story of your career," if there's not a couple of mistakes in there, I also find that when they talk about accomplishments and then I double click on it, I learn a lot about what a person really did. Sometimes a person will claim credit for something that just happened that they had very little to actually to do with, and I learn about very often. I find that a good way to learn about people's skills and depth of knowledge.

Lenny (01:21:10):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Kim Scott (01:21:14):
Yes. I love my new it's called Attitude, and they're shampoo bars and conditioner bars, so it comes in cardboard, wrapped in paper. There's no plastic. It's much more environmentally friendly, and I have long hair. It gets very tingly and the conditioner works, so I recommend.

Lenny (01:21:35):
Very unique suggestion. Is there a favorite motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with people, find useful to come back to in work or in life?

Kim Scott (01:21:46):
"It's not mean. It's clear." This is something someone told me on the streets of Manhattan. It's actually the origin story of Radical Candor. I was walking my dog, almost got hit by a cab, and this man, a perfect stranger, looked at me and he said, "I can tell you love that dog." That was all he had to do to move up on the care personally dimension, but he says, "You're going to kill that dog if you don't teach her to sit." And he pointed at the ground this kind of harsh gesture. He said, "Sit." The dog sat, had no idea she even knew what that meant. And I kind of looked up at him in amazement and he said, "It's not mean. It's clear." And then the light changed and he walked off leaving me with words to live by. So I think about that stranger all the time.

Lenny (01:22:30):
Such a good story. Final question. I read online that you started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow at some point in your life. Can you please explain this part of your life?

Kim Scott (01:22:41):
Yes. So I studied Russian literature in college, very practical major. And then I moved to what was then the Soviet Union in 1990 when I graduated from college, and I wound up taking a job with, first of all, I was with an investment company and then they pulled out of Russia and put the money in China. And so I wanted to stay in Russia and through a friend of a friend, I got a job working for this diamond company called Lazare Kaplan, new York-based diamond company, and they were trying to figure out what they should do in Russia. And I found out there was an opportunity to start this diamond cutting factory. And it was actually my first management job because I had to hire these diamond cutters and I had to hire them away from these Russian diamond cutting factories and I knew nothing about management or business or anything.

(01:23:44):
I'd studied Russian literature. I knew a lot about Dostoyevsky, so I thought it was going to be easy though. I was like, well, the ruble is collapsing. I'm going to pay them in dollars. Of course they'll come work for me. But they didn't take the job right away. To my surprise, they wanted to have a picnic. And at the picnic we brought a bottle of vodka, and there's a rule in Russia, if you open a bottle, you got to finish the bottle.

(01:24:07):
So by the end of the bottle of vodka, I realized that what I could offer that the state could not offer them was to give a damn about them. They wanted to know that I would be a manager who would get them out of Russia if things went sideways there. And as you can imagine, I've been thinking a lot about, they were all men, about these men because I haven't been able to get them out. And I'm devastated by what Russia has done to Ukraine, but that was the moment when I realized that management really matters, and that to be good at it, you have to care about other people. And that was what made it interesting to me.

Lenny (01:24:53):
Man, that is a heavy first job as a manager.

Kim Scott (01:24:56):
Yeah. Yes, it was.

Lenny (01:24:58):
Wow, Kim, this was awesome. I think we're going to help a lot of people become better leaders. I think we're going to help a lot of companies change their culture. I'm so honored that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow up and learn more about your stuff? And then two, how can listeners be helpful to you?

Kim Scott (01:25:18):
Radicalcandor.com is our website, and I'm not much on Twitter slash X anymore, but you can find us. We do a lot of posting on LinkedIn. I think that the thing that people can help me do is to send us a note. You can also email us radicalcandor@radicalcandor.com and let us know what could we do in podcasts like this or in our materials? What could we do that would make it easier for you to put these ideas into practice? Because Radical Candor is, it's about behavior change, and it sounds easy, but it's really hard, and we're always trying to figure out how to help people walk the talk here.

Lenny (01:26:02):
I think doing this podcast is going to make a dent in that goal.

Kim Scott (01:26:05):
Oh, good.

Lenny (01:26:06):
Kim, thank you so much for being here.

Kim Scott (01:26:08):
Thank you. I really enjoyed it.

# Growth tactics from OpenAI and Stripe’s first marketer | Krithika Shankarraman

## Transcript

Krithika Shankarraman (00:00:00):
It seems like there's a playbook for everything, there is a framework for everything, but the reality is you have to spend the hours and the time to really understand your customer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):
You were the first marketing hire at OpenAI. I believe ChatGPT is the fastest-growing product in history. Let me ask you this. A lot of people might be hearing like, "Oh, ChatGPT." It's like, why do you need marketing?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:00:18):
Everyone knew of ChatGPT, but when you clicked one zoom level further, the thing that came up was, "I don't know what to use it for." The work of marketing ended up becoming creating this sort of use case epiphany where people could say, "I had no idea ChatGPT can do that." A lot of marketing metrics tend to be vanity metrics about the number of clicks that you got, number of views, number of impressions. I think those are all bullshit numbers. What is that experience that you want your customers to come away with when they interact with your brand?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
If your advice is, "Don't just copy what other companies do," what should people be doing?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:00:50):
Put together a four-step process that has served me pretty well. The first step here is...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
Today my guest is Krithika Shankarraman. Krithika was the first marketing hire and VP of marketing at OpenAI, the first marketing hire at Stripe where she was the only marketing person for three years. She was also an early marketing leader at Retool and at Dropbox. She also did marketing for Android at Google. Currently, she is executive in residence at Thrive Capital where she supports their portfolio and founders on all things marketing and helps hire early marketing leaders for their startups.

(00:01:21):
In our conversation, we talk through all of the biggest lessons that she has learned about how to market your product from her time at OpenAI, Stripe, Retool, Dropbox and other places, including her four-step diagnostic approach to marketing, her anti-playbook playbook, what B2B companies can learn from consumer marketing, career advice for people looking to get into marketing, and also just what people that don't want to get into marketing should know about marketing to be successful.

(00:01:46):

(00:02:13):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform. I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own.

(00:02:53):
Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny, and 10 X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.

(00:03:31):
This episode is brought to you by Airtable ProductCentral, the unified system that brings your entire product org together in one place. No more scattered tools. No more misaligned teams. If you're like most product leaders, you're tired of constant context switching between tools. That's why Airtable built ProductCentral after decades of working with world-class product companies. Think of it as mission control for your entire product organization. Unlike rigid point solutions, ProductCentral powers everything from resourcing to voice of customer, to road mapping, to launch execution. And because it's built on Airtable's no-code platform, you can customize every workflow to match exactly how your team works. No limitations. No compromises. Ready to see it in action? Head to airtable.com/lenny to book a demo. That's airtable.com/lenny. Krithika, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:04:29):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be chatting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):
So you were an early and the first marketing hire at some of the most iconic companies in the world. What I want to do with our chat today is basically go through a lot of these companies that you've worked at and see what lessons we can extract about your time leading marketing at these companies. And I want to start with OpenAI. No big deal. You were the first marketing hire at OpenAI. Things seem to have gone really well over there. I believe ChatGPT is the fastest-growing product in history. Does that resonate?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:05:03):
It does. Not that I can take credit for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):
Well, we'll talk about that. Either way, nice job. Let me ask you this. A lot of people might be hearing like, "Oh, ChatGPT." It's like, why do you need marketing? It's like the most magical thing in the history of the world. How much value does anything add to making it as successful? Can you just talk about just the value that a marketing person adds to a product like that that's already incredible?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:05:25):
Yeah. When you think about all of the different stages of the funnel, awareness was clearly not the problem that ChatGPT or OpenAI had. Everyone knew of ChatGPT, but when you clicked one zoom level further, the thing that came up was, "I don't know what to use it for. I don't know what it replaces. Should I be using search for this? Should I be using ChatGPT for this? How can it even help me?" And so the work of marketing ended up becoming, creating this sort of use case epiphany where people could say, "I had no idea ChatGPT can do that. And yeah, maybe I should be using it for X, Y, Z reason in my own life." And so I think you have to be very diagnostic in terms of what can marketing be doing to help, rather than just going off of the typical top of funnel, and then middle of funnel and conversion-oriented tactics that end up being in a playbook.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:14):
So for folks that listen to this podcast, it's a lot of product managers, product builders. A lot of them don't have a lot of experience with marketing. I think it's an important insight there of just, this is a thing marketing can help you with is helping people understand how to use your product, understand use cases, understand examples, things like that. So I think as we go through this, I think this is useful for folks to understand of, here's what you may not be good at and may need marketing help with.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:06:38):
Yeah. When done right, product management and product marketing should be best friends, right? And you are working together at every stage of product development. Rather than thinking of it as a handoff at the end of the conveyor belt when the product's been built, you sort of hand it off to marketing to take it out the door. If you can think of it as sort of a three-legged race from the very beginning of product development, then you go to market with the right thing in the first place. You get these insights from customers, you hear the language that they're using, which can be the sort of cheat code for how to message and position the product in market. And of course, there's a creativity angle on how to differentiate your product in the market, but ideally, you're doing that in lockstep with the product management side.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:18):
The other element of ChatGPT's marketing success, I know that you spent a lot of time on the enterprise side, is just consumerish marketing tactics for enterprisey products. Can you just talk about that? And it feels like that's emerging more and more just like consumer tactics for enterprise products.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:07:35):
In typical organizations that I've been a part of and leading marketing for, the enterprise side of the house, the B2B side of the house usually fits the mold of demand generation where you're creating demand for the sales team and you're bringing new customers and prospects into the fold and into the orbit of the company. That again, was not the problem at OpenAI. When we turned on the contact sales form for ChatGPT Enterprise, which was one of my first launches at the company, our lead volume 40 X-ed overnight. It was unanticipated even beyond our wildest expectations. And so some of the things that I had to do are not typical to marketing at all. I sat down with ChatGPT and I coded up a Python script that ended up functioning as our first lead qualification, lead-scoring model. That was used in production for way too long, longer than I'd care to admit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:25):
It's so funny. I think about when ChatGPT first launched and OpenAI just launched, everyone was just like, "How will you make money? How do you make money with something like this chatbot that's pretty smart, but sort of not that smart?" I remember there's a video of Sam Altman being asked, "How do you make money with something like this?" And I don't know if you just saw this, he just like, "At some point we will ask ChatGPT, how do we make money?"

Krithika Shankarraman (00:08:47):
Yes. And I think the reality is it's not a solved problem. And a lot of folks, a lot of companies in the AI domain are trying to figure out the right pricing model. And it's something that you've talked about in your newsletter and so on, but there is a value creation aspect to using AI that doesn't kind of neatly fit the mold of SaaS-based pricing or seed-based pricing, or even usage-based pricing. So, I think there are still some frontiers to figuring out where is the value, how do different types of organizations and companies and consumers find value? And again, it's not the typical sort of KPIs that you would typically try to optimize and maximize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:27):
I will say, though, in terms of pricing, it feels like ChatGP, it works. It's just like a monthly fee, talk to it up to a certain limit. It's wild to think back now, there was a sense, "We don't have no idea how will this make money." Now it seems so obvious.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:09:41):
Truly was a research preview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:44):
And I remember Sam Altman just launched, "Here, check out this chat thing that we are trying with," and then the fastest product growth in history. No big deal. I want to come back to this point you made about this playbook, anti-playbook kind of a thinking. You kind of pointed out that with ChatGPT and OpenAI, there was no playbook, and you find that often people following playbooks don't work. Talk about that insight.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:10:08):
In my current role in my career, I've spoken with a lot of founders, and typically, the founders reach out because I've worked at companies that they look up to and they're looking for that playbook. They're looking for, "Hey, just tell me how Stripe did it. Tell me how Retool did it. Tell me how OpenAI did it." And I really hesitate to share any such detail because there was a combination of context, competitive landscape, and the overall sort of zeitgeist of when the company's operating, how the company's operating, that really adds a lot of nuance to what works in the market.

(00:10:43):
And so doing the same things, like if you're just kind of copying the outcomes or the outputs of the strategy and trying to follow in the footsteps of the tactics, you're not paying enough attention to the inputs and, what were the variables and the deciding factors which led to that strategy in the first place? So what I like to do is try to unpack more of a framework for how do you get to become more of a diagnostician to understand the right strategy or tactic in the first place, rather than saying, "How do you copy something that led someone else to success?" Because those criteria may not apply to you at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:17):
So let's follow that thread because everyone's like, "Goddamn, I need a play. Just tell me how to do this." Okay, so there's no playbooks that you... If your advice is, "Don't just copy what other companies do that have done well," what should people be doing? How do they approach figuring out how to market their product and help it grow faster?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:11:35):
Yeah. So I was an engineer before I became a marketer, and so I have brought a little bit of an engineer's framework to the marketing side of the house. And so something that I've tried to do is put together a four-step process that has served me pretty well. The first step here is diagnosing. So, diagnosing the actual problem. Again, this usually means taking a zoom back when a founder comes and asks, "Hey, we really need to hire a demand gen leader. Who do you know in your network that we should be thinking about?" And I'm like, "Let's talk about your funnel. Do you have a lot of people coming in at the top of the funnel? And when they do come in at the top of the funnel and you start talking to them and having a sales conversation, how likely is it that you close them? How likely is it that you win that deal?"

(00:12:20):
That usually tells you very astutely, do you have product market fit? Once you're already in the room and people are converting, you have found that problem statement that is critical to them that is hurting them the most, and your solution is resonating as a solve to that problem. And so that means yes, probably throwing in more at the top of the funnel is a very good move to make at that time. But on the other hand, if you say, "Yeah. I mean, we get a lot of interest, but once they're in the room, they have a bunch of questions. They're asking about, how do you compare to X competitor and Y competitor? And why does it cost so much?" and et cetera, et cetera.

(00:12:59):
That probably means that there's more to be done in the product market fit zone rather than throwing in more at the top of the funnel because you have a leaky funnel at the bottom. And so hiring a demand generator may be the worst thing that you can do versus thinking about more of a product marketer who's thinking about the competitive differentiation, the positioning, the sales enablement that gets more people through at the bottom. So that's that diagnostic step at the top.

(00:13:24):
Second to me is analyzing your competitors' approaches. So to me, this is not about being super laser focused on your competition because that leads to these local maxima rather than thinking about face shift changes and breakthroughs that you can make as a company. But when you analyze your competitors' approaches, evaluating what others do in the space can kind of give you a useful baseline and identify opportunities and gaps and niches that your company can take in instead.

(00:13:51):
And then, this is the critical step. The next one is you have to intentionally take a different path than what everyone else is doing. And so driving a strategy that sort of sets the company apart is really critically important. I think it's so core to the discipline of marketing, ensuring that differentiation in the market. And you don't have to go into a cave to come up with these ideas and strategies. You can usually go and look at domains that are far outside of your own rather than your direct competitors and come up with some great ideas that you can cross apply and bring in and steal into your own domain or vertical instead.

(00:14:28):
And then the final piece is just experiment, test, validate all of that, and then scale what works and kind of discard what doesn't. So you really have to have a lot of that ability to throw away work when you might have spent a ton of calories on this wonderful piece of content. But if it's not working, don't double down on it. That bias of the sunk cause fallacy really comes into play, especially when you've poured your heart and soul into creating artifacts for marketing. So experiment, test, validate. Give people that psychological safety to fail, especially your teams and organizations. And then, yeah, once you find what works, really double down on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:06):
Let me summarize what you just shared here. So essentially if you think you're like, "I need help with marketing," or, "I have a problem and I think I need to hire a demand gen person or a paid growth person or a SEO person, or I don't know, content writer," something like that, before you do that, first of all, go through these four steps.

(00:15:24):
So step one is diagnose. Spend time understanding what's the specific problem you want to solve, then analyze. This is so interesting, I've never heard it this way. So then it's analyze what your competition is doing so that you can then, one, find inspiration and see where gaps exist. And then it sounds like the core part of it is just make sure you differentiate and choose a different path versus just try to be the better thing or the cheaper thing. And then the final piece is just like, "Okay, here's our path. Let's test run some small scale tests to see if this would work."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:15:54):
Yeah. I'm a marketer through and through now. So I mean you got diagnose, D. Analyze, A. Take a different path, T. And experiment for the E. So it's the DATE framework. I've just kind of coined it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:05):
Oh, beautiful. Okay. We got a new framework hot off the presses. I love it. DATE, okay. So with differentiation, what's your thoughts on saying you're just a lot better or a lot cheaper?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:16:19):
Being cheaper is a race to the bottom, especially when you think about sort of scaling laws and how things are playing out. Every company is sort of becoming an AI company at this time. And so as models get cheaper and more capable, being cheaper is not going to be the thing that really is a durable approach in the market. And I think in terms of doing things differently, it's not just for the sake of it. I think it's really that novelty and that differentiation is something that people are craving for. They're not looking for yet another tool in the market. They are looking for something that aligns with their values, aligns with what their goals are. And so if you can be really crisp on understanding the user need, understanding what is the problem space in which they're operating, I think that one-two punch of a fantastic product experience, and then the marketing experience to match, can be a superpower for your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:11):
Awesome. Okay. So let's go through an example of a company you did this with, and then this may take us to another company you worked at in the stories there.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:17:19):
Yeah. One that comes to mind is definitely Retool. Retool was very different from both my experiences at Stripe and at OpenAI because both Stripe and OpenAI, for better or for worse, were inbound companies, right? There was so much latent demand that we were fighting off people breaking down the door trying to get to our products. With Retool, marketing was between the company and revenue. And we had fantastic product market fit with the enterprise space, with the developer community, but awareness was a challenge. And so how do we go out, not just wait inside of our house waiting for people to knock down the door, but rather step outside of our house and start introducing ourselves to the neighborhood?

(00:17:57):
So, thinking about outbound channels and building demand engines was the name of the game. And here, one of the ways to think about that is, "Hey, should we just scale the paid marketing channels that we already have working for us?" And that's when the diagnostic really came into play, which is, what are the leads that are coming through the funnel? Are they turning into sales-qualified opportunities? What kind of pipeline are they driving? A lot of marketing metrics, again, tend to be vanity metrics. They tend to be about the number of clicks that you got, number of views that a tweet got, number of impressions. I think those are all bullshit numbers.

(00:18:35):
Really, what you want to be looking at is your impact on either signups if you're a self-serve product, PLG, or in terms of a B2B company, sales leads and revenue that you're driving, pipeline and opportunity that you're driving. So we diagnosed that and we found that for the most part, our paid social channels were doing not much for us. And so we had to invest in net new engines. So that was the diagnostic. When we looked at some of the competitors, we saw that they were doing a lot of content marketing. They were doing a lot of events programming. And we could've kind of followed in those footsteps, but there was the ability to take a different path.

(00:19:13):
And so what we decided to do was double down on customer marketing and customer storytelling because the thing that differentiated Retool from a lot of the copycat competitors in the market was that we had terrific traction with true enterprises who were paying for the product, who believed in the product, who were expanding within the product. And so having them tell the stories on our behalf was so much more compelling, and no other company could replicate the kind of customers that Retool had in its bench. So, we wanted to make sure that we were using those logos, we were using those companies to the best impact possible, and then we experimented. We tried to put together webinars, different types of sales dinners, different types of event formats to see what actually worked best for us, and scaled the ones that worked and discarded the ones that didn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:02):
Okay, there's so much here. So in the diagnose step, I think in kind of a between-the-lines piece of advice here is look at what's already working. So you looked at, okay, maybe paid growth, maybe this, maybe that. And then it's like, "Okay, what seems to be working is people find us through maybe another logo, another customer that's fancy, and they're like, 'Oh, Netflix is using Retool. Oh, maybe I should check it out.'" So I think that's a really important lesson there is don't try to like, "Hey, we need to start expanding our top of funnel to all these different channels." There's one more-

Krithika Shankarraman (00:20:32):
And really litigate some of those channels, too, because on the surface they might be working, but are they actually driving pipeline and revenue?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:38):
Got it. So they may be showing vanity metrics. Numbers are nice at the top, but they're not sales qualified potential. They don't actually stick around. Okay. And then, the analyze competition is really interesting. So again, it's just like, "What are they doing? What can we be doing differently?" Does it ever make sense just to do what they're doing but do it better, or is that rarely a successful path?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:20:58):
You still have to do something a little bit different. I recall a very specific example at Stripe where our product, Stripe Connect, which was made for marketplaces like Uber and Airbnb, where not only are you accepting money as a platform, you're also paying out people on the seller side of the marketplace. The competition truly was to become a payment facilitator. So rather than using another off-the-shelf service, instead of using Stripe Connect, you might go off and become a PayFac yourself. And a lot of the services, organizations, the consulting groups that were helping companies become PayFacs, the things that they were doing was really leaning into that old school terminology, the jargon of the legacy systems and so on and so forth.

(00:21:43):
And Stripe kind of figured out, "Hey, we need to rank higher for the SEO terms that people are searching for. So how do we help rank for PayFac without actually talking about ourselves as a PayFac solution?" So we decided to kind of do a reverse RFP system where we created a piece of content that said, "Hey, if you want to be a payment facilitator, here's the secret playbook. Here's all the things that you have to do. And by the way, if this feels onerous or annoying, it is, and you should use Stripe Connect instead." So there was still a little bit of a zigging where others were zagging. Yeah, but I think if we had done the same thing in terms of becoming a consulting service to become a payment facilitator, Connect would be nowhere near the sort of run rate or revenue that it drives for the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):
Okay. And this is a great segue to Stripe, which, another company you were the very first marketing hire at. You were also, I believe, the only marketing person for three years at Stripe.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:22:38):
I do not recommend that to anybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:41):
There's a lesson there. Okay, so let's talk about Stripe. What are some of the biggest things you learned marketing at Stripe that you think might be helpful to other marketing people and founders?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:22:51):
Oh, man, there are so many things to choose from because I was Stripe for almost eight and a half years. Joining as the company's first marketing hire, building that marketing function from the ground up, it really gave me the privilege of working very closely with our founders, John and Patrick. I would say actually I was not the first marketer at Stripe, John and Patrick were the first marketers at Stripe because they were developers themselves. They truly understood the developer community. And when that audience for Stripe was squarely developers to begin with, they knew exactly how to authentically reach that audience.

(00:23:24):
And so I had to unlearn a lot of the things that I had learned at Google and Dropbox coming into Stripe in order to reach developers authentically. The experience really taught me the importance of deep product understanding as well. You couldn't really play act at understanding the product, especially when developers are trained to spot bugs, right? So not only do they spot those bugs in code, they spot those bugs in marketing and in blog posts.

(00:23:51):
And so if the marketing pieces are your first impression of the product, they're an extension of the product itself, you have to hold yourself to a very high bar in terms of how you communicate about the product. And so we did a lot of investment in design work, in polish in terms of how the marketing came together. And yeah, the value of creating marketing artifacts that were deeply integrated with the company's mission and the craftsmanship that went into the product was another lesson that I learned very deeply at Stripe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:23):
So kind of along those lines, again, people may look at Stripe and be like, "Okay, it's the best thing ever for payments. Why do we need marketing? It's just like, engineers build it and integrate, it works." What is it that marketing most adds to a product like Stripe?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:24:40):
Across my time at Stripe, marketings are very different purposes. And so I kind of see it in different epochs or chapters of my time at the company. The first chapter when I joined, our head of partnerships at the time, Cristina Cordova, handed me a Hackpad at the time, which is like a notion-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):
I remember Hackpad.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:25:00):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
It turned into Dropbox Paper.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:25:02):
That's right. And so she had kept a Hackpad, a secret Hackpad away from the engineering team, which was all of the features and products that we had shipped but had never communicated to our customers about. And so the launch sort of ended with shipping the feature rather than communicating with the user. So the first chapter at Stripe was really just getting through that backlog and making sure that the ethos at the company changed to say, "Hey, your launch isn't complete if you're just code complete. You have to actually ship it to the customer and make them aware of it." So usage became the north star, engagement became the north star rather than just the binary, has it launched or not?

(00:25:41):
The second chapter at Stripe was really starting to expand what a launch meant, right? So, going from just putting out a blog post for people who were already subscribed to the RSS feed of the company versus thinking through, "Hey, how do we reach out to them through an email, through other channels? How do we really invest in this fanatical community that is getting so excited about the product experience?" So we pulled together developer experience as a function, built out developer relations to really have that community feeling and vibe.

(00:26:13):
And then it was about starting to think through the multi-product ecosystem. So Stripe went from a single-threaded payments processing company to one that had multiple different products and features for the audience and the user base. So then the work of marketing became, how do you help people understand and navigate potentially this multi-product ecosystem and platform to figure out what's the right set of features and solutions that they should be using for their needs?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:41):
And so this is, again, a good example of marketing can do a lot of different things and depends on the stage, depends on the needs. It almost starts again with diagnose. Where do we have a need for marketing and growth?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:26:53):
And especially in hyper-growth companies, I think you have to run that diagnostic every three months, every six months in order to stay adaptable and flexible because those top level goals do change. At some point, we really have to figure out how to scale our sales function. We have to figure out how to scale internationally. And so being adaptable to that meant constant reprioritization and making sure that you were also hiring people who weren't super deep in particular disciplines, but having a team structure that was T-shaped, people who could be flexible to those needs of the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:24):
Coming back to your point about how there's no playbooks, is Stripe another example where it's like, this has never been done before, we shouldn't copy what other payments companies have done in the past?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:27:34):
Yeah. If we did, we would still be talking about PCI compliance and payment gateways.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:40):
There's so much of what you share that reminds me of Raaz from Wiz, who also, you were an engineer originally, she was a product person. Yeah, I think. I don't know if she was an engineer, but a product person. So it's your-

Krithika Shankarraman (00:27:52):
Her first PM, actually. Yeah, Raaz is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:54):
Okay. And I think there's a few things that are so interesting here. One is you both have non-marketing backgrounds, you went from another function. And I think, you tell me, it gives you a whole new perspective on marketing, not just the traditional education of marketing. Is there anything there?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:28:09):
One thing it's definitely made me is very skeptical of most marketing channels and strategies and tactics. And so I would be one of the first people to say, "Is that really going to work? What developer is clicking on paid ads? Isn't a better thing that we could be doing for them telling them to install ad block?" So I think that skepticism means that you just have a higher bar for the quality of the content, the substance of the content. You want to make sure that the marketing is as substantive and as crafted as the product experience itself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:40):
The other really interesting corollary here is she was very big on avoiding the generic acronyms and classic industry norms, I forget what they were, for cloud security. But it's just like, "We're not this thing. We're Wiz. Here's what we do."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:28:53):
They are definitely a company that zags when others zig. I still have my Wiz socks, which have these beautiful 8-bit characters on them. Their branding really stands out in the sea of sameness in SaaS conferences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:05):
Okay. There's something I heard that you did at Stripe that I wanted to ask you about that worked really well. When you came into Stripe, you looked at all of the biggest customer support issues and you turned those into docs to help people serve themselves. Can you just talk about that insight and the power of doing something like that?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:29:22):
Yeah, and this was a great practice that existed at Stripe even before I joined, which is all new hires would do a support rotation just to build empathy with our customers. So, users first was a very core operating principle for the company, and we spent about 20% of our time collectively talking to customers, talking to users, talking to non-users to understand their needs, their gripes about the product. And that tradition, I think, continues to today. The support rotation specifically was such a fantastic fountain of understanding, "Hey, these are the areas that people are confused about."

(00:29:54):
Again, I kind of mentioned this sort of cheat code of talking to your customers and using the language that they use to describe their problems as a shortcut to fantastic product marketing and messaging, because it really tells you what are their pain points and how can you meet them where they are. You want them nodding their heads along as they're reading your landing pages. And so when I was doing the support rotation, there were thematic things that kept coming up. People were asking, "Hey, do you process subscription payments or recurring payments?" Or, "Can I pay people out with Stripe?" And I was like, "Of course you could, but there's no reason you should know that because we don't tell you anywhere."

(00:30:30):
And so that ended up being a stacked rank backlog of landing pages that we produce that just educated people. And this is really important when you have strong top of funnel demand, and potentially not as many people and you're not trying to scale your teams linearly. Having those educational resources, especially for developers, a fantastic marketing funnel sometimes doesn't look like talking to sales. It often never looks like talking to sales. It looks like a self-directed educational experience. Even the sales process ends up being very consultative typically with very technical folks on the other side. So yeah, that was a great way and a great program to figure out what content we should focus and prioritize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:12):
These are really cool just little ways as a new marketing person. You can add value really quickly is kind of what I'm taking away.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:31:21):
Talking to customers is at the top of the list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:24):
Today's episode is brought to you by LinkedIn Ads. One of the hardest and also most important parts of B2B marketing is reaching the right people. I'm constantly getting ads for products that I will never buy, and I almost feel sorry for the money that these companies are spending pitching me on their spend management software or some kind of cybersecurity solution that my one man business just does not need. When you're ready to reach the right professionals, use LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn has grown to a network of over 1 billion professionals, including 130 million decision makers, and that's where it stands apart from other ad platforms. You can target your ad buyers by job title, industry, company, role, seniority, skills, even company revenue.

(00:32:08):
All the professionals that you need to reach in one place. Stop wasting budget on the wrong audience and start targeting the right professionals only on LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn will even give you $100 credit on your next campaign so that you can try it for yourself. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. Only on LinkedIn Ads.

(00:32:32):
There's something else that I know that you're a big advocate of which is internal reviews and just making sure everyone's aligned, which I think a lot of people and especially startups try to avoid. Like, "Let's just move fast. We don't need to have all these meetings where people review stuff," but I know you're a big advocate of that. Talk about why that's so important.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:32:48):
Yeah, this is a hill that I would die on, which is that good process or sufficient process is actually something that speeds up a company rather than slow it down. It stems from this idea that we talked about a little bit, which is that marketing is an extension of your product. It's the first touchpoint your customers have with your product. And ideally, you're setting expectations there in terms of what they should expect once they sign up for the product or commit to a contract and start using it within their companies. And when I think about that, consistency is really, really important.

(00:33:20):
The other part, the other facet of why process is important is because especially as you're in hyper-growth companies, scaling teams is part and parcel like what you're trying to do. And when you bring in someone new, you want them to be just as self-sufficient as somebody who's been at the company for two years. So in your second week, can you be as successful as someone who's been at the company for two years? And the reason that I have that principle in mind is because it makes you kind of break out of your shell of, "I've been at this company for some time now. I understand the sort of unspoken rules of the organization. I've built up enough social capital that I can withdraw from to get something done. And I know which conference room to stand outside of to get the founder to review a piece of content before it goes out the door."

(00:34:09):
That is not scalable, that is not sustainable. And so if you want somebody to be successful and contributing member of the organization very, very quickly, setting up some of these processes with the intention of trying to help them navigate how to go from idea to execution can be very empowering and powerful. Nobody wants to do the wrong thing. They want the guardrails to understand what great looks like at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:33):
Can you speak more about what this looks like? Say a startup wants to start implementing something like this.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:34:38):
Two simple processes that you could put into place today is, one, set up a forum called Marketing Review. This can be a live meeting that you host for an hour a week or it can be a Slack channel where people are posting things async, or even an email alias where things get sent to. Have that be transparent to the rest of the organization so anyone in the marketing team, anyone in the product organization can join that forum. What that does is it creates a fishbowl where you see sort of, what are the themes that come out when somebody reviews a piece of content? Are they looking at the strategy? Are they looking at the audience? Are they looking at the words? Are they looking at the sort of design approach? So you learn through osmosis of looking at some of these discussions.

(00:35:20):
And then I would say don't overdo it. I would say there are probably two checkpoints in a program that are really important to get aligned at. One is the 20% review. A 20% review is a strategy review. What are we trying to accomplish? Who are we trying to do it for, and what is the rough approach that we're going to take? If everyone feels comfortable with that, you come back at the 80% mark where you've done a lot of the work on the artifacts, the different types of teams that have to be involved and how do you take something to market it in the first place.

(00:35:49):
And the reason that I say 80% is sort of critical because if you come in at the 99% mark and you're just looking for a rubber stamp of approval, and you don't really have the slack in the system to be able to make any changes, then that review was worthless. So come in at the 80% mark where you can still make some substantive changes before it goes out the door. And that serves the purpose of consistency so that your brand is showing up in a consistent way to the audience. And two, it helps the rest of the organization learn from each other.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):
There's almost this unspoken element of what you're describing that I want to dig into a little bit, which is the need and value of having consistent and high quality marketing, communication. Why is that important? There's always this talk of just move fast break things. "We're going to be scrappy. We're not going to be obsessed with perfect quality of our, I don't know, websites and emails." Just, why is that important? Why do you value that? Why should companies maybe value that more?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:36:45):
It's funny because with the companies who value velocity actually do value their brand just as much, but oftentimes they think of these as two siloed separate initiatives that they have to put their headspace and calories towards. And I actually think they are not mutually exclusive. They are actually very interconnected. And so when you understand the consistency of your brand, it actually empowers the organization to move faster because you kind of understand how you want the brand to show up in the world. What is that experience that you want your customers to come away with when they interact with your brand?

(00:37:25):
And the brand is not just marketing artifacts, it is your product experience. It is how your customer support team talks to them, how they resolve tickets. Are you getting passed between a bunch of different teams or is someone just resolving your ticket right away? It's the experience that they have for candidates when they come to recruit your company. So all of these variety of touch points that touch so many different organizations and teams within your organization, they are the amalgamation that makes up your brand. And so if you think of these two things as separate silos, you are optimizing for entirely the wrong thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):
I've very viscerally learned the power of brand doing my newsletter. I so fear doing something very wrong in my newsletter. It's like, saying something that's completely off or having something broken, or sending an email by accident to everyone that's not ready. I just feel like once I break that, just there's so much power and trust that people have built for what I share and there's so much power that comes from that trust. If I launch a new podcast, people will assume it will be good if they trust what I do and I maintain high quality. And so it's just like a constant fear I have now of breaking that trust.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:38:40):
Yeah, I mean whether it's fear that drives you is questionable because I think it's also a commitment to your craft.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):
Yeah, yeah.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:38:51):
But I think that's exactly right. A brand is an expectation that you create within your audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:57):
And to what you said, if you have a strong brand that people trust, everything gets easier. You pitch them a new product. Like if Stripes like, "Oh, we have a new billing service."

(00:39:08):
"Oh. Oh, I bet it'll be awesome because it's Stripe." Or if OpenAI launches something. So it just makes life easier if your brand is strong, if there's trust.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:39:17):
Yeah, and you got to take that responsibility seriously because even with something like Stripe, we know that people are going to come try out things that we put out the door. And so we wanted to make sure that that met up to people's expectations. And same thing with OpenAI. When we launched something, even though we were trying to be first to market and that velocity was so important for the company, oftentimes it also came with sometimes putting the brakes on to kind of understand, how can we improve the quality of the experience? How can we make sure that it is safe? So there were different criteria at the two companies, but a similar ethos overall for the brand experience that we wanted people to experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:55):
Let's actually come back to OpenAI. How long were they around before you joined? It was like many, many years, right?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:40:01):
Many, many years. So OpenAI had been around for almost a decade as primarily a research organization. They had launched ChatGPT about a year before I joined. And so that was the first foray into saying, "Hey, our work is not just announcing research breakthroughs, it is about putting products into the market."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:19):
So there's a few questions I want to ask here. When is a time to bring in a Krithika? When is it like, "Okay, we need help here"? Or, "A bunch of smart people doing great work, people have the product, but I think we need a marketing person that knows what they're doing."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:40:33):
I think the first criteria is having tremendous product market fit, which is really important because you're throwing fuel on the fire, and you might be throwing different types of fuel on your particular fire. So one pillar for marketing that you have to think about is product marketing. So, if you have a high velocity engineering organization and product organization that is putting out a lot of different features and your customers aren't able to keep track, maybe the engagement's not so high for some of the newer features versus some of the core features that you had in the past, a product marketer can really help bring a discipline of launch excellence and customer engagement, differentiation in the market. How are you positioning the product?

(00:41:15):
The second pillar for me is demand generation. So if you have much more of a sales driven buyer journey in motion, how are you bringing the demand engines to bear so that your lead generation, your pipeline generation is staying really strong and solid? Or you might want to think about brand, right? You might want to think about community development as a big part of what you're doing as a company. So it really depends, but I think in all of these, you found a spark of product market fit before you're really going for it.

(00:41:43):
The second for me is that you're distinguishing enough between capital and marketing and lowercase and marketing. And there's an important distinction I've learned over the years, which is capital and marketing, the marketing team, the marketing function at the company is responsible for those channels and artifacts and engines that are driving the funnel for the company, but they are not the end all be all of the discipline of marketing.

(00:42:08):
And that's where the lowercase and marketing comes in, which is, what do you stand for as a company? What is the storyline that you're telling as a founder when you're talking to the press, to the larger business community? And then it really is a whole company motion where the product team is thinking about, "How are we going to market? What are we going to market with?" The sales team is figuring out, "What is the right ICP, the right customer profile that decision makers, that we need to be reaching?" And then it is this entire joining of the organizations to make that happen really effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:47):
Yeah. I think along these lines, there's a reason Brian at Airbnb merged marketing, or product marketing and product management. However much of that actually happened or not, but the intention-

Krithika Shankarraman (00:42:58):
I would be so curious to see a follow-up a few years on on how that's been going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:01):
Yeah. Okay, let's have Brian back to talk about that. That'd be really interesting. I wanted to actually ask, an interesting thing is happening with ChatGPT versus Claude, and it's so interesting. Claude is arguably better at many things at code, at least at this point. Things are always changing. It seems to be a better writer in a lot of ways. People prefer it for writing, but it's just like ChatGPT is just dominating. It's like, that's what people associate with AI now is just ChatGPT. It's just caught mindshare globally. What is it, do you think, that allowed ChatGPT just to be that? Is it just first mover advantage? Is it some kind of other element? Has it been better longer? Something really interesting is going on there.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:43:46):
One of the things that comes to mind is the orientation when it comes to large language models, and AI in general, is that we're just at the very beginning innings of this whole paradigm shift. And so every single week there is a new breakthrough in AI that comes out from some lab or the other. There's this one-upmanship on point changes and eval numbers and so on and so forth. But I think to customers, the users of the product, the things that make it delightful are the same things that make any product delightful. And there's a sense of loyalty that builds up over time when there is a shorter and smaller delta between your expectations and your reality.

(00:44:30):
And where those expectations are exceeded, it is accretive to the brand and your loyalty to the product. And where there is a negative delta, that tends to be something that it really detracts. I guess, long story short, what I'm trying to say is that all of these companies have to think in a much more long-term oriented fashion because it's not about a race of the best chatbot and the best outputs. It's about, how does AI become a positive force for humanity?

(00:44:58):
And so that's going to take a lot of change management and a lot of collaboration between a variety of different organizations rather than just the companies themselves and the product experience itself, because it's going to permeate every aspect of our lives. Our personal lives, our academic lives, our work lives. And so to make that transformation happen, my hope is these companies are not super focused on just their competition and one-upmanship, but rather thinking about the paradigm changes that need to happen for our society at large.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):
It does feel like they are taking that responsibility really seriously, but it is a massive responsibility. Before we leave OpenAI, it feels like it may be the most impactful, important company in the world right now just because they seem to be at the furthest edge of where AI is going. And so it's just such an interesting place to study. So let me ask you this. Just as a person working there, what's something people may not know that's a wonderful, positive element of how open AI works that's just like, "Oh, that's super interesting"? And then, what was maybe a challenge of working at OpenAI?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:46:08):
A surprising thing that surprised me at the company was just the warmth and intellectual curiosity of my peers and leaders at the company. And truly, the sort of commitment to the mission of making artificial intelligence that benefits all of humanity was not just lip service. It was something that was embodied day to day. The sort of questioning that happened, the sort of pressure testing that happened, the rigor with which products were developed, go-to market strategies were developed, was bar none.

(00:46:38):
And so that's something that I really admired, and it was a privilege to be a part of that organization. I think challenging, of course, is just being at the eye of the storm, right? The eye of the hurricane. So, all eyes are on OpenAI at all times, and I think that is a good thing because of the ramifications of the product. But it also really raised the stakes in terms of how we operated and with what scrutiny, everything that we did was looked at with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:09):
Do you recommend that sort of experience for people? Because I imagine work-life balance wasn't great. I imagine there was a lot of stress and worry constantly. Who's the right... When in your career is this a sort of gig to take on versus not?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:47:25):
I'm a big believer of what Claire Hughes Johnson, who was COO at Stripe, used to share with us, which is there is a concept of a work-life blend and sort of making sure that you're working at a company that has three components. I think first and foremost is always people. So, are the people that you're surrounding yourself with ones that push your thinking, who are kind, who are genuinely interesting people to spend your hours with? Because you're spending a vast majority of your time with them.

(00:47:54):
The second to me is product, right? Do you go to sleep thinking about the product, waking up, wanting to put it into the hands of more people because you know it is going to be good for them or useful to them? I'm not one of those marketers who can pick up any product and market it. I have to have that conviction behind the product itself.

(00:48:15):
And then third is sort of potential, right? Not just potential for the company to do well, but potential for your discipline to have an impact on the trajectory of the company. And so when you have that kind of potent combination, it can really change your perspective on what's draining, what's energizing. But being very self-aware of what gives you energy is also very helpful to align with the needs of the company, also.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:41):
Let's shift to talking about Thrive, which is where you work now, and talk about what your role is. And what's interesting, I think, about this role is you get to work now with a bunch of different startups instead of go really deep with one. So share what you do there. And then, what are some things you've learned there so far from a perspective for marketing?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:48:59):
Yeah, surprisingly, more people know about Thrive these days than used to even just a few years ago. Thrive's a very unique type of investment company. And sometimes, when I made the leap, people used to ask me, "Oh, was this always in your ambition to make the leap into the investment side of the house?" And I can honestly say it wasn't. But I think being at a firm like Thrive really gives you a very different perspective and it strengthens your ability to be a stronger operator, whether that's in marketing or go-to market or strategic finance, or whatever other pillar within the company there is.

(00:49:32):
Yeah, Thrive's mission is to be the most meaningful partner to founders. And so there's a lot of high-concentration, high-conviction investments each year. And Thrive is also unique in that it's a network of builders, and so they are really pulling their investment strategies from having been founders themselves. So my role at the company is to help our entire portfolio with all of their marketing needs, so sometimes it means being interim CMO for some portion of time until they find a great leader to fill that seat. Sometimes it means pressure testing their strategy and making sure that their growth targets are ambitious enough. Sometimes it means looking at a Figma file for a landing page that's going out the next day and making sure the words are as good as they can be.

(00:50:14):
And that variety across a bunch of industries, a bunch of stages of companies, everything from a company that hasn't even been incorporated yet, all the way to Databricks and Stripe and OpenAI when it comes to the types of organizations that we work with. And in the end, the variety of domains can range from consumer to healthcare, to defense, to B2B SaaS, to AI. So it is a variety pack in the best way possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:43):
And so what are some things you've learned so far? Because I imagine this is a very different experience. I don't know, especially things that you've changed your mind on even, working with a bunch of companies, early stage versus, what can I say?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:50:57):
It's a really different method of operating. And so when you're in the leadership role for marketing within a single organization, you have at least a medium term north star in terms of what your teams are trying to drive for the company. And as much context switching as there might be, there is still one company, ideally one product, one buyer journey. That hasn't always been the case, especially with OpenAI and Stripe, but it can span B2C, B2B, B2D.

(00:51:27):
Thrive is very different in that if you want to be a meaningful partner to the founders, you cannot just jump from 30-minute call to 30-minute call to 30-minute call. You have to go deep to understand the context. And if anything, it's really underscored my ethos that you as a marketer, the best thing that you can bring to the table is your adaptability and flexibility. So, to really diagnose and not just try to spot patterns and themes and playbooks for these companies, but rather be very deep in the trenches with them to understand their unique context, their unique concerns, their unique characteristics, and their values and what they want to bring into the world.

(00:52:05):
The reason that they want to work with Thrive is not because we are bringing our past experiences to the table, but rather because they're trying to do something new that has never been done in the world. And so those are engagements that are the most exciting is that you are building and going into uncharted territory alongside these founders.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:26):
I bet they're all like, "Krithika, what is the playbook for growing this B2B SaaS company?" And you're like, "Nope."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:52:30):
And I say, "There is none."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):
Damn. But we got the framework that we talked about. Okay, I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about just career advice for marketing people, whether it's early stage or later stage. You have this concept, the chameleon CMO. Talk about that and why that's important for marketing folks to think about.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:52:48):
Yeah. The conventional wisdom for many CMOs is to be like a T-shaped marketer. And what that means is go deep in one of these pillars that we talked about, product marketing, demand marketing, brand marketing, and that kind of becomes your calling card in the world. If a company needs brand expertise, they go for this kind of flavor of CMO. Or if a company needs to really grow their pipeline or their demand gen or their consumer growth, they go for more of a demand and growth-oriented CMO. And I think this chameleon CMO concept is a bit of a novel one in that, again, I think modern marketing leaders have to be really good at a bunch of different things.

(00:53:30):
They have to be very analytical. They have to be best friends with the data science pod because they need to understand the impact of their marketing. They, of course, have to bring creativity, but it is in service to the buyer journey. It is in service to revenue goals and goals that they share with the sales team or the product team and so on, so marketing operating in a silo is no longer a real possibility. So the ability to diversify your interest, maybe going from T-shaped to comb-shaped is probably the right approach here so that you can go deeper in different domains when it is useful for the company through the diagnostic that you do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
That sounds very hard. I love this beneficial of the comb shape. It sounds like I have so much to learn, so many little skills to build.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:54:16):
Before AI can come in handy. Some of the most brand marketers can become very analytical with the support of a tool like ChatGPT. If your eyes glaze over when you look at giant dumps of CSVs, it's nice to have a partner that is nonjudgmental to kind of push your thinking and to help you understand the details of the data behind the brand work that you might be doing, or vice versa. If you're a very creative product marketer, a very analytical growth marketer, you can work with ChatGPT to be more of a brainstorm partner and really push your thinking on the creative side. So I think becoming a non T-shaped marketer is getting a little bit easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:00):
That's such a good point. A good segue to an AI question. Hey, we got to talk about AI. One of your former colleagues, Kevin Garcia, wanted me to ask you something. He suggested I ask you about taste and creativity in AI. So he said that you're one of the best writers that he's ever worked with. You combine technical backgrounds with creative taste. You do pottery, you should. And you're a voracious reader. And he wanted just to poke at what you think about just how taste and creativity and writing change in the era of AI.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:55:31):
I think it's going to become so much more important. First of all, I will say I am not a ChatGPT hyphen person. I was an em dasher well before it became a ChatGPT thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:41):
Me too. Me too. I hate that. But just for people don't know, people are filtering out em dashes, right? Because they think ChatGPT is the only thing using em dashes?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:55:49):
Yeah, and I don't know what to do about it because this is such a core part of my identity, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:55):
That's a big statement, the em dash.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:55:58):
To take a step back though, I think if anything, taste is going to become a distinguishing factor in the age of AI because there's going to be so much drivel that is generated by AI, can be generated by AI, that power is at anyone's fingertips. But truly, the companies that are going to distinguish themselves are the ones that show their craft. That they show their true understanding of the product, the true understanding of their customer, and connect the two in meaningful ways. If they can use AI to augment their efforts to make that happen, that's better than them subsuming their efforts. So to build taste, there's plenty of past episodes that you yourself have recorded that get into building that work. But to me, that is going to be a real differentiator for not only great marketers but great companies to stand out in the field.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:50):
There's a concept that I love that recently I learned from Guillermo at Vercel. He calls it exposure hours. That's when I asked him how to build taste, and that's kind of a value they have at their company is just increase your exposure hours to great stuff, because that is how you build taste. I love that. It's such a simple actionable thing you can do.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:57:09):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:09):
Yeah.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:57:10):
And at Thrive, we have this share channel, which is just sharing things that we're seeing out into the world. It's not particularly deal flow news or competitive news or anything like that, but it is things that we have seen that resonated with us for whatever reason.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:24):
Along these lines of not over-relying on ChatGPT, AI tools for writing and creativity, it feels like there's going to be a big issue with people just starting early in their career where they just never learn how to do the thing, and they just rely really heavily on ChatGPT and tools like that to write, to email, to communicate well. I guess, do you have any advice for folks that are early career, just how to find that balance of not over-relying but still leveraging these tools?

Krithika Shankarraman (00:57:53):
I think there's two schools of thought here. One is that sort of the domain, the discipline itself stays static and the way that you approach it changes over time, whether you're going at it in a manual way or an automated way or an AI augmented way. But I think the other school of thought, which I more believe in, is that the discipline itself is changing. And so what it means to market a product, what it means to show up as a fantastic operator is in and itself changing. So if you're not leveraging some of these tools, you will be putting yourself at a disadvantage. But understanding the underlying mechanics, this is why I would still be a very firm believer in STEM education, is that you understand the fundamental concepts. And then you can have a choice and optionality in how you decide to apply those concepts, but the concepts themselves have to be there in the foundations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:46):
Yeah. Easier said than done because there's all these tools now and you're just like, "Hey, I need to write a report for school. I guess I could just, maybe this time I'll just ask ChatGPT to help me with this one."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:58:56):
Yeah, the mindset of learning has to be maybe the one that we have to really imbue as a value. Because being of that growth mindset, if you go to school just to earn the grades or to finish the coursework, it's a very different mindset than if you go to school to learn those concepts and to understand how to apply them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:20):
That's something that stuck with me from my chat with Toby Lutke from Shopify. We were chatting about just what is the most important things to incubate in your child? And his answer I loved, which is just, "Curiosity."

Krithika Shankarraman (00:59:32):
I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):
Yeah, and that's what you're kind of speaking to is just if you're curious about learning, you'll almost avoid some of these things or you'll use these tools in a really interesting way just to learn things more deeply.

Krithika Shankarraman (00:59:43):
And that stays with you into your career, right? Because you can either go into your career trying to get to that next ladder in the promotion rung or you can get there to bring a genuine curiosity to, what makes us different? What makes our customers tick? And how do we find those unique insights that can unlock something that nobody else has?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):
That reminds me. To sort of close out our conversation, I wanted to come back to pricing strategy. I have that in my notes here and I haven't gone back to it. So let's focus on the AI and pricing strategy. Just say someone is trying to figure out pricing for their product and they have some kind of AI product. What are some tips, some piece of advice to think this through? Any general frameworks you use?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:00:25):
Again, there's no playbook. I feel like it's such a non-answer, but I think the real answer is experimentation. And we found this firsthand multiple times at Stripe, but also at Retool. I think there was a very visceral example where we decided to bring our free product into the hands of more users and sort of what was available in the free plan. And then there was another one that we tested out as a pricing function where we decided to do something quite controversial, which is to take the thing that our sales team was gated on, a self-hosted version of Retool, and made that available self-serve to anybody who wanted it. They didn't have to talk to a salesperson. And that kind of blew up the funnel, right? Because the amount of pipeline that the sales team saw had diminished considerably, but it also helped them focus up market, on higher ACV deals.

(01:01:13):
And so that trade-off is really hard to make, so the only way we could do it was through experimentation and piloting to build conviction. So I would say AI is no different in that you kind of have to test the market to see what works. Is it a seed-based model? Is that where people are deriving value? Or is the way that they speak about the value of the product something quite different? Is it hours saved? Is it the amount of things that they could do now that they couldn't do before? And so there might be a metric there to go off of, and I don't think anyone solved it, especially with agents coming into play. How you pay for AI workers is going to be very different. What is that unit of completion for things like code generators? It's going to be a Wild, Wild West before we come up with something that is as internalized now as seed-based pricing or usage-based pricing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
Wild indeed. I want to actually follow this insight you had around Retool. That's really interesting. Yeah, so you opened up self-hosted Retool. What was the insight there, because this might be useful to people, that convinced you to play with that? Seems like a big deal change to how you price and do trials.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:02:30):
There were two guiding principles here. One is, do people actually want to talk to sales before they get a self-hosted thing? It's sort of like the SSO attacks, right? Is that really the thing that you want to gate your value on? So, that was one. And so we saw a lot of demand from smaller customers that still wanted self-hosted for a variety of reasons, because they worked in regulated industries or they worked with very private data and PII. And so it wasn't just something that was, "Hey, if you have 10,000 employees at your company and you're an enterprise, you want self-hosted." It was that for a variety of different reasons, regardless of your company size, you might want self-hosted. So that insight kind of led us to say, "Hey, where is the delineation here? Because the sales team should be talking to larger customers, landing larger deals." And so to align those two was one of the driving principles.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:19):
Awesome. Okay. Two final questions before we get to our very exciting lighting around. I'm going to take you to a couple of recurring segments on this podcast. The first is AI Corner. And with AI Corner, what I try to get to is some way that you have figured out to use an AI tool in your work to do better work or do faster work, to be more efficient. Is there something there that you could share? And if not, that's also totally cool.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:03:46):
Ooh, it is hard to pick because there's not many things I don't use AI for these days, and oftentimes it's a catalyst and an accelerant to the work that I'm already doing. But I think I can actually unlock my ability to talk to dozens of companies across the Thrive portfolio in any given week, and the ability to get deep on their context, their environment, their competitive landscape. We can do that because of the tools and the products that Thrive has invested in from an engineering perspective. So we have internal tools that are driven with AI that give us a lot of insights and access to expertise for these companies so we can show up as more meaningful partners in a day-to-day basis.

(01:04:29):
So I think the ability to mix AI tooling then accelerates work that you're already doing, and then AI-based tools that unlock superpowers that wouldn't otherwise be available to you unless you're going deep into Google Groups archives or talking to people across the organization to pull out things that are inside of their brain. That kind of institutional knowledge being made more accessible by AI is actually more powerful sometimes than the tools themselves. And in fact, even at OpenAI, it's one of the things that we advised most enterprises to invest in first is their own operational efficiency rather than just the AI magic dust they could sprinkle on top of their product experience for their customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Awesome. Okay. Final segment of the podcast we call Fail Corner. And the idea here is we have all these amazing guests, all these super successful people on the podcast, all these stories of epic wins and nothing but success. And I think in reality, that's not the case. And it's important for people to hear that things aren't always up and to the right and always win, win, win. Is there a story from your career you can share where things didn't work out and what you learned from that experience?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:05:44):
And again, this question's hard because there's so many things to choose from as potential examples here. And you're absolutely right, Lenny, in that most careers are not the sort of linear journeys that are reflected on somebody's LinkedIn profile. No, I'll talk about a fantastic success, which is called Stripe Relay, which you probably... Oh, I'm just kidding because nobody remembers it. It was ahead of its market. We launched it back in 2014. It was supposed to be the platform with which e-commerce companies would tap into social commerce. The buy buttons if you remember that. And it launched to a lot of fanfare, but then eventually failed. It didn't produce the sort of revenue or the numbers that we had expected.

(01:06:28):
And the understanding here was that as much as one side of the marketplace, or you might have some conviction that you need to put something into the market for a particular moment in time, the timing of the market really matters. And the timing of multiple parties coming together to make a platform work really matters. And so the learning here was we hadn't gone deep enough into the market dynamics. We hadn't done enough user research. Did people really want this? And if they did, what were their alternatives? What was the stacks that they were operating in? And would they adopt a net new tool versus one that integrated into existing systems directly like their e-commerce inventory management systems and so on? And so for that reason, I think, again, it was ahead of its market and ahead of its time, but a clear flop regardless of the effort that we put into that launch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:22):
This reminds me of when Kevin Weil was on the podcast talking about Libra, which was his cryptocurrency project that Facebook ran, and he's just like, "Okay, that was a terrible time to launch something like that where people trusted Facebook the least in our history." And now may be a good time to try something like that. Basically, a cryptocurrency platform to send money internationally for free. What a dream that would be. Okay. Krithika, is there anything else you wanted to share or maybe something you wanted to remind people of from what we've talked about? Just to leave folks with a final nugget before we get to our very exciting lightning round.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:07:55):
If there's one thing that folks take away, I hope it is that they know that there isn't one clear answer to any of the marketing problems. It seems like there's a playbook for everything, there is a framework for everything, but the reality is the work is hard. You have to spend the hours and the time to really understand your customer, and there is no replacement for that, and there isn't going to be even with the advent of AI. And the other part of it is to deeply understand your product as well. What are you bringing to the table? And not just your product, but your company's values, your unique approach that you're bringing to the table. And really be intentional and thoughtful about that because in the absence of that, nothing is going to be a substitute to bring that combination of ingredients together.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:45):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We have five questions for you. Are you ready?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:08:51):
Hit me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:08:57):
On the professional side, one book that I recommend to most people is April Dunford's book on positioning called Obviously Awesome. She does a great job breaking down how to position a product from scratch if you've never had to do that, and she's just so great for her real talk. So, really highly recommend that. And then I love fiction, so I would say one of the best reads in the last couple years has been Madeline Miller's Circe, which is a retelling of a Greek myth. Lyrical prose, beautiful writing, highly recommend.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:32):
Love the combo. April Dunford, we're huge fans of her on the podcast. She's been on twice. I think her book is in my background. We'll link to her episodes.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:09:40):
And mine.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:41):
Oh, wow. Okay. So cool. Yeah, she's the best. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:09:48):
I'm really late to the game, but I'm finally catching up on Severance. So, no spoilers, but I'm about halfway through the first season.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:54):
Wow, okay. It's hard to weigh the spoilers, but yeah, keep going. It's amazing. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:10:03):
Granola for meeting notes because, all right, I love taking meeting notes as a way to stay engaged in the conversation and to pay a lot of attention, but I also know I'm furiously typing away. And so the ability to augment my notes and bullet points has been a game changer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:20):
That's two guests in a row that said Granola, and I'll give a plug. You get a year free of Granola if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter. For not just you, but your whole company up to some limit. Check out lennysnewsletter.com and click Bundle, and sign up and get Granola. So cool. I love that.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:10:36):
Happy to help, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:38):
It's helping Granola, and me, I guess. Yeah, it's great. Okay, thank you. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find useful in work or in life?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:10:49):
My teams have now gotten tired of me saying this, but I say it all the time, which is the delta between expectations and reality is the function for unhappiness. And so it is much easier to change expectations than it is reality, so I tend to spend a lot of my energy making sure that expectations are set. Not just with customers when it comes to our external marketing, but internally with stakeholders, project partners, and even within the team so that they understand what are some of the trade-offs that we're making, or why we're making certain decisions. So I could not espouse that philosophy enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:25):
I love that this isn't, because I think when people first hear that it's about your own happiness, but I love that it's about other people perceiving how a something did and setting their expectations correctly. Final question. Okay, we've already talked about the em dash, but I want to ask you again. What I'm finding is, so the story here is basically people have discovered ChatGPT's using em dashes a lot, which are these long dashes that you have to use special couple letters on the keyboard to use. I'm a huge... I use these all the time, and people are starting to filter them out on Twitter because they're assuming it's generated by ChatGPT. There's content that has em dashes they assume isn't real. Will you continue using em dashes in spite of all this?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:06):
I have begrudgingly reduced my usage of em dashes-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:10):
Same.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:10):
... but you will not pry them out of my cold dead hands if you tried.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:15):
Oh, man, me too. I don't even know. It's like command, options, dash or something to even put it in there.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:20):
No, it's option, shift, minus.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:23):
Option, shift, minus.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):
I have to type it. I can't conceptualize in my head. Yeah, and then there's actual rules for when an em dash is the right thing versus, there's a middle-

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:32):
Em dash and the Oxford comma, the two core tenets of my toolbox.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:36):
Is an Oxford comma where you add the comma at the end or you don't? Is that the-

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:36):
You keep the comma at the end. You must.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
Okay. I'm all for that, too. It looks so weird without it. But there's also another, like a shorter not em dash. I guess it's called something else, right? There's like-

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:48):
The en dash, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
En dash.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:12:49):
That's for ranges of numbers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):
Okay, okay. I love that you know all this. Okay. Well, with that, Krithika, this has been so fun and so awesome. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe work with you, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:13:05):
Krithix.com is where you'll find links to all my online presences. And one of my personal missions this year is to meet as many of the up-and-coming marketing talents in the world. So anyone that you know is earlier career, ambitious, but really showing their impact at their organization, please introduce them to me. I would love to chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):
And then what's the best way for them to reach out to you? Is it just on your website?

Krithika Shankarraman (01:13:29):
Yes, please.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
Amazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Krithika, thank you so much for being here.

Krithika Shankarraman (01:13:34):
Thank you for having me.

# Kunal Shah on winning in India, second-order thinking, the philosophy of startups, and more

## Transcript

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:00):
Microsoft, Adobe, Alphabet, IBM, Palo Alto Networks, even Starbucks, the CEOs of these companies were all born in India and immigrated to the US.

KUNAL SHAH (00:00:08):
A lot of CEOs have done well because they follow the “dharma” of the founders quite well.

KUNAL SHAH (00:00:13):
“These are the principles that were given to me and I'm going to sustain this and make it even bigger.”

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:16):
I want to keep talking about India and how it's different and how to build products that are successful in India.

KUNAL SHAH (00:00:21):
No Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.

KUNAL SHAH (00:00:24):
The concept of time is not the same.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:27):
What do you see as the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?

KUNAL SHAH (00:00:30):
India is changing because now, for the first time, we are seeing founders being respected and unicorns being celebrated.

KUNAL SHAH (00:00:36):
We have a National Startup Day, and probably the first generation that will have to prove ourselves to be very large profitable companies.

KUNAL SHAH (00:00:42):
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else building.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:48):
Today my guest is Kunal Shah.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:51):
Kunal is one of the most well-known and respected entrepreneurs and product leaders in India and around the world.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:58):
He shares endless wisdom on Twitter and LinkedIn where he has over 1 million followers.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:03):
He's the CEO and founder of CRED, a FinTech startup based in India, which was last valued at over $6 billion and as of couple years ago processed over 20% of all credit card bill payments in India.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:16):
Prior to CRED, he founded three other startups including Freecharge, which he sold for over $400 million to Snapdeal.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:23):
Kunal is a deep thinker, both about product and about life.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:27):
His background is actually in philosophy, which comes across very clearly when you hear him share his advice.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:34):
In our conversation, we get deep into what makes working and building in India different from the US markets and other markets, including why trust is so essential and why so many people are so much more risk-averse in India.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:46):
We talk about the biggest challenges and opportunities within the India market, why there are so many successful Indian immigrants in CEO roles across tech, and what we can learn from that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:56):
Also, why companies in India can quickly grow DAUs but not ARPUs, and what that means for building products in India.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:03):
We also talk about how to stay curious and open-minded and the power of second order thinking.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:07):
Also, stories of failure, lots of contrarian takes and so much more.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:13):

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:18):
It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:23):
A big thank you to Cyan, my ET, for making the connection to Kunal.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:27):
With that, I bring you Kunal Shah after a short word from our sponsors.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:33):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:36):
If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:45):
That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:51):
Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features, and hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:03):
WorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:09):
It's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:15):
AuthKit's designed is stunning out of the box and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:21):
It's an effortless experience from your first user all the way to your largest enterprise customer.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:26):
Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to 1 million users.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:31):
Check it out at workos.com/lenny to learn more.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:35):
That's workos.com/lenny.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:39):
This episode is brought to you by Orb.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:42):
As a business, you care about revenue, but as a product team, the last thing you want to do is delay a product launch or a pricing change because your team has to rebuild billing from scratch.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:52):
Orb is a flexible usage based billing engine that lets you evolve your pricing with ease.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:57):
The fastest growing product teams at companies like Vercel and Replit trust Orb to power their pricing changes and launches.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:04:04):
Use Orb to ship product faster, stop worrying about billing, and evolve pricing with ease and control.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:04:25):
Kunal, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

KUNAL SHAH (00:04:29):
Lenny, thank you so much for having me, and a huge fan of everything that you do.

KUNAL SHAH (00:04:35):
And like I said before, India is a huge beneficiary of what you do.

KUNAL SHAH (00:04:40):
We are all people who have learned the art of product by just figuring it out, and watching some content here and there and reading some stuff.

KUNAL SHAH (00:04:49):
So kudos to everything that you do.

KUNAL SHAH (00:04:51):
And like I said earlier, you do a fabulous job of taking the information asymmetry of the art of product and  making it accessible to many of us across the world.

KUNAL SHAH (00:05:02):
So thank you.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:03):
Wow, I really appreciate that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:04):
This is already feeling great to me.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:06):
I have a huge.. so it turns out this podcast has a huge audience in India, as do you.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:12):
And so I feel like this conversation is going to be really special and really meaningful to a lot of people.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:18):
I wanted to start with something very tactical.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:21):
There's a product framework that you came up with that I absolutely love, and I've shared it with at least 30 founders over the last couple years. And this is actually how I discovered you initially; I heard about this thing, and I'm like, who's this guy Kunal Shah?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:34):
And look at us now, chatting.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:36):
Could you explain this framework briefly and then just how you've used it or how you recommend people apply it?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:43):
Oh, and by the way, it's called Delta 4.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:44):
I don't know if I even said the name.

KUNAL SHAH (00:05:46):
Yeah, it's called the Delta 4 framework, but I think it's actually quite simple.

KUNAL SHAH (00:05:51):
If you think about it, a lot of people say that your product has to be 10x better and it's not very measurable.

KUNAL SHAH (00:05:57):
You don't know if you are 10x better or not unless you're delusional.

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:01):
And the trigger for me was actually, I'm the unusual tech founder in India.

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:06):
I'm the only humanities/philosophy major founder in India who's got into tech.

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:12):
And I often wondered if most people who were my peers, or people who were ahead of me, were significantly smarter academically or otherwise.

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:21):
And why did I become successful with my first startup, Freecharge, which I exited in 2015 for nearly $450 million?

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:28):
And I was like, “What would make this happen?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:31):
Because I would not qualify into this super league of really top IIT rankers that exist in India.

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:38):
And that got me onto this philosophical quest to find out what makes things successful.

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:43):
So the simple framework is, an example I give often is that, imagine the old way of taking a cab ride and an Uber. And if I asked you to give me the score of efficiency on Uber and let's say getting the old cab, what would you say, Lenny?

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:58):
I'm curious.

KUNAL SHAH (00:06:59):
Out of 10?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:00):
Yeah, give a cab three and then Uber like a nine.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:04):
Yeah.

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:05):
So every time you see that the product efficiency delta is greater than or equal to four, three things happen.

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:14):
It is irreversible.

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:16):
Second is that you have a very high tolerance for it to fail.

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:21):
If Uber fails a little bit, will you say, “Oh my God, I'm going to really stop using it?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:30):
No.

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:31):
And the third thing is what I call the UBP, ‘Unique Brag-worthy Proposition.’

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:37):
Every time humans unlock a Delta 4 product or service, they cannot stop talking or sharing about it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:46):
And therefore all Delta 4 products will naturally have lower CAC or sometimes zero CAC because people, humans.. and think about it, Lenny, how you discovered Google, definitely not through an ad, definitely not through some performance marketing here and there.

KUNAL SHAH (00:07:57):
Somebody showed you the demo and you were like, “Oh my God, this is crazy.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:01):
And that's what I'm seeing right now, what's happening with everything on OpenAI and everything that is happening around LLM feels like magic and it's Delta 4 because the efficiency of doing things before and after is now showing that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:12):
But failure is the real problem.

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:15):
And making everything tech does not make things more efficient.

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:19):
Let's take an example.

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:21):
Buying a suit for yourself online versus offline, all tech, cool stuff, all the features built in.

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:30):
What would you say the efficiency of buying a suit online is versus, let's say, buying a suit offline?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:35):
I've actually done that and it was a terrible fit. It did not fit at all.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:39):
And so it's efficient, but the end result was not, it's probably often not great.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:45):
So it's probably-

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:46):
Overall efficiency score, what would you give?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:48):
Of buying a suit online?

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:50):
Yeah, versus offline.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:53):
I'd probably give it five and five.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:56):
Offline is actually probably a better experience.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:58):
I give it a seven.

KUNAL SHAH (00:08:59):
That's crazy because you've broken the principle, this is a tech product, but the efficiency is better offline.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:06):
And therefore when the delta is less than four, what you will discover is that it is reversible.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:15):
You will not see people bragging about it and you have zero tolerance for it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:21):
So you're never going to buy a suit online. I can tell you that right now.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:25):
So I think it's a simple framework.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:28):
I believe that if many companies applied..  I know now many VCs in the US use this as part of the training program for analysts.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:36):
omebody in Sequoia mentioned this to me that they have this as part of the thing, but in India we are not still applying many of these things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:46):
I think it's a simple framework to at least know. You can apply this to features, you can apply this to products, you can apply that to business.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:55):
And oftentimes this is a longer concept.

KUNAL SHAH (00:09:57):
We can talk about it in many ways because it's derived out of some study around entropy and evolutionary biology, which is the root of how I discovered and thought about Delta 4, that “When does a species get disrupted ” or “what is entropy and why does low entropy require growth of high entropy?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:10:18):
It's a day long podcast on its own.

KUNAL SHAH (00:10:19):
So some other time.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):
We'll save that for a future follow-up, just diving in on the psychology of Delta 4. Just to kind of summarize this, because I think it's such a powerful framework and I find it useful to convince founders why their product isn't taking off.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:32):
They may feel like this is better than. The classic example, is a better Excel.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:36):
Look, this is so much better than Excel.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:38):
It can do all these things.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:39):
You don't have to learn all these formulas.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:41):
But the trick here that I love is just what people rate the existing solution 1to 10, what would they rate your solution 1 to 10?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:48):
It has to be four points higher, otherwise no one's going to pay attention.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:52):
And I think it's pretty simple.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:53):
People are busy, they have enough things to do, they have enough products and apps, they're not going to take the time to really dig into something if it's not that much better.

KUNAL SHAH (00:11:00):
Absolutely.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):
I'm going to go in a totally different direction.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:03):
I want to talk about Indian CEOs in the US.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:06):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:07):
So today the CEOs of Microsoft, Alphabet, Adobe, which is a $250 billion company it turns out, IBM, which is a $170 billion company, Palo Alto Networks, which is a $100 billion company, even Starbucks, also a $100 billion company, I was looking that up.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:25):
And then also Twitter before Elon took over Twitter. The CEOs of these companies were all born in India and immigrated to the US.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:32):
And I might be wrong, but I think this is the largest ethnic group of CEOs of tech companies other than just white dudes in the US.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):
So I'm curious why you think Indian immigrants are so successful in business and in tech in the US, especially in these very high positions.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:50):
And I'm most curious, just what can we learn from that?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:53):
What can we learn from their success?

KUNAL SHAH (00:11:55):
It's a great question.

KUNAL SHAH (00:11:56):
I often wonder about it and I have had the good fortune to meet a fair bunch of these individuals, and had a chance to really explore with them what really went on.

KUNAL SHAH (00:12:07):
So there are a few things that pop out.

KUNAL SHAH (00:12:10):
And again, these are all conjectures, which I can't prove in any way, but it's a thought experiment to talk about these things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:12:18):
First is in general, immigrants that get out of the country usually have a chip on their shoulder in a very different way.  And the struggle that they have to go through to just get out and be successful, and that hunger that got them there. There was no privilege.

KUNAL SHAH (00:12:37):
They came from very, very humble backgrounds and literally no money to start with.

KUNAL SHAH (00:12:42):
So I think that this force is real.

KUNAL SHAH (00:12:46):
You can say that for many immigrants in general as well. But appreciation for math in general, or logic which came to society in a big way, kind of gave. Let's say for example, lots of engineering graduates come from only a few countries because society was bent towards early exposure to mathematics.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:04):
And I think that kind of helps create status that will get appreciated.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:10):
For example, being an engineer, a doctor...  As a philosophy major, I was a write-off for society.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:16):
So the reason I'm the rare commodity over here, because you are not considered to be very bright unless you break into these very hard exams and do very, very hard things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:25):
So the filtering criteria on its own is big.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:28):
But there's another interesting framework altogether, which I have actually learned from this gentleman, Devdutt Patnaik. He applies Indian mythology and management principles together.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:39):
And it's an interesting thing. There are three major Indian Gods.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:43):
One is Brahma, the God of creation, Shiva the God of destruction.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:49):
I'm  generalizing here, but that's the classification.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:52):
And the third is Vishnu, the God of sustenance.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:55):
And their avatars-the word “avatar” comes from Vishnu who keeps changing avatars.

KUNAL SHAH (00:13:59):
So we have Rama, Krishna, all these Gods are avatars of his.

KUNAL SHAH (00:14:04):
So what you notice is that if you take a two by two of people who are high on values and low on values, are high on obedience and low on obedience, you make an interesting two by two.

KUNAL SHAH (00:14:19):
Now, Lord Krishna, who is one of the very popular avatars, which suits the entrepreneurial category,  is high on values but very low on obedience. He was known to be the naughty God and he could actually create lots of things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:14:36):
And there is Rama, who is known to be the one who follows principles and is obedient.

KUNAL SHAH (00:14:41):
So they will follow ‘dharma’ and scale on that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:14:45):
And then there are these notorious characters, there is Ravana who is low on values, low on obedience, and there is Duryodhana which he says that he is high on obedience but low on values.

KUNAL SHAH (00:14:55):
So these are the people that you don't want to be.

KUNAL SHAH (00:14:57):
And what you notice is that a lot of CEOs have done well because they follow the ‘dharma’ of the founders quite well.

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:05):
They have not diluted the dharma of the founders who have started these companies, and managed to sustain that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:13):
And a lot of CEOs have this need to say, "Oh, I'm going to change the company forever and it'll be my identity and I will change the logo and I'll change the name and I will do all sorts of things."

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:25):
But maintaining ‘dharma’, where I will say that “These principles were given to me and I'm going to sustain this and make it even bigger," comes from the humility of saying that there is something that was built with some pure form factor, and I think therefore that character stays on.

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:41):
And therefore we have the characters of Brahma and Shiva, the founder and destroyer.

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:47):
That's the thing.

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:48):
But sustenance is the harder one.

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:51):
And therefore our avatars keep happening over time and different hurdles come and then different levels come.

KUNAL SHAH (00:15:57):
But when you think about the archetype of, at least the Indian CEOs, I've seen that they are fabulous at moving between Krishna and Rama all the time.

KUNAL SHAH (00:16:07):
They can play this consistently, and therefore they keep evolving and keep making these companies bigger and bigger.

KUNAL SHAH (00:16:14):
And I think we'll see a lot more of this in years to come, because now they have the role models of these individuals who have done well.

KUNAL SHAH (00:16:22):
But the key principle is that if you ask the founders, they will love these CEOs if they're around because they maintain the dharma.

KUNAL SHAH (00:16:32):
For example, what Tim is doing is maintaining the dharma of Steve Jobs because if he had tried to change the dharma of Steve Jobs and the values of the company, it's very hard to imagine it sustaining itself forever.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:45):
Wow, what an answer.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:47):
What I love about this is this combination of using a two by two and Indian mythology. It is like the microcosm of you, which is philosophy and tech.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:58):
And so I love that and it makes a lot of sense that that's where your mind goes.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:02):
Something else this makes me think about is, I read this book a long time ago, Jim Collins ‘Good to Great’ or one of his early books about leadership, and he talks about level five leadership I think. Here level five leaders are ones where it's not about them, it's about the business and they can disappear in the future and things will work great.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:19):
Yes.

KUNAL SHAH (00:17:20):
And I feel it is very hard if you believe that your identity needs to have its own position and legacy, and therefore a lot of time chasing status causes disruption because you will say that “Oh, this doesn't have my signature in it.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:17:37):
And therefore accepting the religion and trying to be the Pope of it or the father of it is better than trying to say, "Oh, I need to have my variant of religion."

KUNAL SHAH (00:17:50):
And that's where the creative destruction starts happening.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:54):
Interesting.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):
So you said that there's this good balance between Krishna and Rama that happens.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:59):
Can you just summarize where they are in that two by two?

KUNAL SHAH (00:18:02):
Rama is high on values and high on obedience, and Krishna is high on values and low on obedience, but they both are high on values, which means they'll follow dharma, and they'll change sides.

KUNAL SHAH (00:18:17):
For example, let's say Satya during the OpenAI crisis played Krishna and got things out, but he'll switch back to being Rama and continue to keep scaling it up.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):
Amazing.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):
And just to close the loop on here, is your sense that they're actually thinking about this and they're religious, or is this just in the ether of growing up in India and this is just part of the culture?

KUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):
It's a great question.

KUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):
I don't think they consciously think about it, but I think if they ever heard this, they would agree with it, because that's what they grew up with and value systems are much more long-term.

KUNAL SHAH (00:18:51):
For example, I believe all bad behavior in humans comes from being short-term, and being long-term is a big choice to make.

KUNAL SHAH (00:19:04):
And a lot of times a lot of people argue that we have a 95% arranged marriages and less than 1% divorce rate, comes from this whole long-term thinking that people are married through values versus attraction or lust and all of that stuff. They’re more long-term oriented and about building a family, building values.

KUNAL SHAH (00:19:31):
Or low divorce rate is about “we'll fix along the way” versus trying to say “I need to evolve” and “I need to move forward.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:19:38):
So I think being long-term about that mindset, and that's why some cultures last for thousands of years, because of this need for everybody to be more long-term versus short.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:52):
The US could use a lot of that these days.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:55):
You mentioned this interesting fact about how in India, most startups fail. You said, I think, the classic stat is 90%, and that the risk is a lot higher to start a company and then fail.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:08):
Can you just talk about what impact that has?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:11):
How do people try to avoid that?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:12):
Because that'd be amazing if you can reduce the risk of starting a company or is it just that it happens and people get super in debt?

KUNAL SHAH (00:20:20):
I think long-term societies are naturally more risk-averse. And not all great CEOs can become great founders for the same reason.

KUNAL SHAH (00:20:32):
In fact, I would say that it actually makes it very hard to be a founder if you've been a great CEO because you've turned into this sustainer versus destroyer or creator.

KUNAL SHAH (00:20:45):
The nuance I'm talking about is when you are thinking about risk appetite, India is changing, but now for the first time we are seeing founders being respected and talked about and these unicorns being celebrated and our Prime Minister talks about startups quite openly.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:02):
We have a National Startup Day and so on and so forth.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:04):
So I think there is a thing that has changed this, but let's understand the core human behavior.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:11):
India still has a large number of arranged marriages.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:16):
And if you are a founder and a failed founder, your chances of getting a person to marry is still hard to achieve.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:26):
So if this is all true, then the appetite to take risk will be curtailed.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:32):
Somebody gave me an interesting example that there's a very large, let's say CPG company in India, and let's say you do a zero to one over there and the CEO changes in four or five years and your zero to one fails, but you were the best person, that's why you were given the zero to one.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:49):
The next CEO is like, “So what have you done in the last five years?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:52):
He's like, "Nothing.

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:53):
I just tried to launch it but failed."

KUNAL SHAH (00:21:55):
And you are neither given a promotion in the company, nor a new company will say, "Oh my God, I'm going to hire this talent."

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:00):
So the guy who stayed on this stable brand within the CPG company kept growing, but that has natural tailwinds.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:07):
All he has to do is nothing in that brand.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:10):
And then suddenly what you see is that he or she's managed to do well and this guy has done a zero to one has not done well.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:16):
So we do not celebrate risk-takers as a country yet.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:21):
And I think we'll change that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:23):
I think it's changing already, but we have a long way to go.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:27):
One of the beautiful things I often talk about is that when I was in Portugal once and I saw, I don't know if you've ever been and seen this, but in the church normallyonly the Royalty are allowed to be buried or cremated. There is only one more category that is allowed-  the explorers.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:47):
Vasco da Gama, all of these guys who explored the world and took risks and took the country forward, were given the same position as the royalty.

KUNAL SHAH (00:22:55):
So when we give the highest status to risk-takers, the country appreciates it because ultimately we're all looking for markers of social validation.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:05):
Super interesting.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:06):
I want to keep talking about India and how it's different and especially what may surprise people about the market, both building there and then how to build products that are successful in India.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:15):
I saw in a different interview, you talk about how there's this big difference between DAUs and ARPUs. In India it's really easy to get DAUs, basically get lots of users, it's really hard to make revenue per user, and that changes the way you build products broadly.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:30):
Could you just talk about why this is the case?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:32):
Why is it so much easier to get DAUs versus ARPUs?

KUNAL SHAH (00:23:37):
I think ARPU is a function of per capita income of a country.

KUNAL SHAH (00:23:41):
You cannot make $100 per user from a country for a product when their income is let's say $2,500 per year as an average for the whole country.

KUNAL SHAH (00:23:52):
So what happens is many global companies love to come to India because we have the cheapest data, and very high smartphone penetration.

KUNAL SHAH (00:24:01):
So if you look at a lot of global giants, they'll have 500 million users from India, sometimes a billion users coming from Asia and they don't have huge ARPUs, but they help you show the user growth which helps you in your public market and therefore improves your valuations.

KUNAL SHAH (00:24:16):
For example, my guess is that, I don't know if this data is public or not to talk about, my guess is that Meta would not have more than $3 or $4 per user per year monetization in India.

KUNAL SHAH (00:24:28):
But if you look at the user growth in India, it is huge.

KUNAL SHAH (00:24:33):
So a lot of times for global companies, India becomes a great MAU farm but very low on ARPU. Therefore a lot of Indian founders who tried to copy the Western market saying, “I'm going to have a few hundred million users” make a terrible mistake because they will need to then go abroad to find their ARPUs to balance the act.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:24:52):
You talk about how Netflix is a good example of that, where they launched in India, they got lots of users, but just couldn't make a lot of money.

KUNAL SHAH (00:24:58):
Yeah.

KUNAL SHAH (00:24:58):
Because forusers to find relevant content, pay for content, when we have tons of free data, tons of free content all over the place, like short videos that are competing with time, so much going on over here, people actually paying for that by design is going to be less.

KUNAL SHAH (00:25:17):
And I'm not saying that it'll not change in 10, 20 years, but the expectation that many global companies come over here saying that, “I'm going to have these tens of millions of users who start paying me as soon as I come”, for Spotify, for Netflix, or Amazon Prime for that matter has not panned out.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:25:37):
So one of my takeaways here is just when you look at a startup as an investor especially, and you see “We've got 100 million users,” don't treat that the same as say 100 million users in the US or other markets.

KUNAL SHAH (00:25:49):
Absolutely.

KUNAL SHAH (00:25:50):
One more thing is the value of time as a concept.

KUNAL SHAH (00:25:53):
So one of the things you'll notice, Lenny, is that no Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:00):
But let me ask you a question.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:01):
What was your first ever job and how were you paid?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:26:04):
My first ever job, I was tutoring women about computers and passing Microsoft certification tests.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:26:10):
And I was paid, I'm pretty sure it was hourly.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:10):
Now most likely you'll remember what the hour rate income was.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:16):
And even though you've started making a lot more, you still have the concept of what the value of your one hour is.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:23):
But if you ask most Indians, and if you ever come to India and do this exercise when you meet them, ask them “What's your income per day or income per hour?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:34):
Nobody will be able to answer, no matter what their job is.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:36):
They could be staff, at the restaurant, to somebody who's doing really basic work, to anybody in any fancy job, because we've never ever been paid an hourly salary.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:47):
So when you're not paid an hourly salary, the concept of time is not the same.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:53):
And when the concept of time is not the same, paying for time is hard to do.

KUNAL SHAH (00:26:59):
And therefore you'll see a lot of Indians who make, let's say, I don't know, maybe $100 an hour, but still spend an hour to spend $10 on a flight ticket because that's what it is.

KUNAL SHAH (00:27:10):
And if you discuss that with many of the Indians in the West also you'll realize that this is a common joke that they will still fight for the $10 because the value of time is something that is harder to get used to unless from your childhood the unit of time was moved smaller and smaller.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:29):
That is really interesting.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:31):
And you're saying that comes from just the fact that people never get paid hourly?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:34):
It's always a salary, and so people don't write down-

KUNAL SHAH (00:27:36):
The concept of valuing time.

KUNAL SHAH (00:27:40):
Many Indian languages do not have a word for “efficiency.”

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:44):
Wow.

KUNAL SHAH (00:27:45):
And that's true for many Asian languages, the word for “efficiency” does not exist.

KUNAL SHAH (00:27:50):
So then how do you value it if it's not in the vocabulary?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:54):
Fascinating.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:56):
There's something else along these lines of DAUs and ARPUs and efficiency that you talked about that I love, which is this idea that focus is a curse in Asian markets, that in the US there's often this advice.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:09):
“Focus, build one thing that's amazing that everyone loves, try to make that work, scale that, and then, only then, build a new product or build something, build a new big feature.”

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:18):
And your advice is in India and Asian markets in general, it's the opposite.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:22):
And I think it's because you make so little per user.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:24):
Could you talk about that?

KUNAL SHAH (00:28:25):
Yeah.

KUNAL SHAH (00:28:26):
I think one is you make very little per user, so you have to do many things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:28:30):
But also all low trust markets, and let me define low trust markets as where consumers are a lot more wary of trying new things because there are no institutions that protect you against bad behavior done by a company.

KUNAL SHAH (00:28:44):
So for example, if I ever had a fall in a coffee shop in the US, I can think about suing them and making money off it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:28:51):
In India, you're only worried about “I'm going to pay for my thing.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:28:53):
You don't even think about suing the coffee shop or even hoping that you'll get any money for that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:28:57):
So what happens is in a low trust country, and all developing nations are low trust by design, because the institutions are not strong enough to really, really take care of many things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:29:09):
What happens is there is concentration of trust.

KUNAL SHAH (00:29:11):
So you will see that super apps, superstars, super companies all exist in low trust markets because the lack of trust creates concentration of trust, and therefore you will see one app can do 400 things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:29:24):
For example, we have a company like Tata that can do salt to car to jewelry to anything and people will buy it because it's a Tata brand, because it comes from a low trust society trusting the brand and not being, “Oh, I'm going to prefer this new brand.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:29:42):
The joy of trying new things is not so high in low trust nations.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:47):
Wow, I'm learning a lot here.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:48):
I didn't know all this.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:49):
So essentially the brand is even more, exponentially more important in Indian markets.

KUNAL SHAH (00:29:55):
It's funny, but the oldest brand in the world is a brand called Chyavanprash.

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:00):
It's a guy named Chavan who built a “prash” which is a sort of paste that you can have for good health, and it was built in India many, many, many, many centuries ago.

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:14):
And lots of Indian businesses still have the name of the person behind it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:19):
Even the US is like that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:21):
JP Morgan, all these guys are not some fancy name.

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:23):
They're the names of people.

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:25):
And therefore in India, trust still comes from a lot of names of people who had a lot of trust behind them and reputation behind them.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:33):
I want to zoom out a little bit before we go in a different direction.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:36):
What do you see as either the most pressing challenges in India right now for tech and/or the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:47):
And then just generally where do you think things will evolve in the next few years?

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:51):
Sometimes I wonder if the challenges and the opportunities are exactly the same.

KUNAL SHAH (00:30:56):
For example, one of the biggest challenges we have is, we have very low female participation of labor compared to many markets.

KUNAL SHAH (00:31:04):
But I also believe it's an opportunity because you can, let's say, use AI and create many new types of business and opportunities because now work from home is not an alien concept anymore.

KUNAL SHAH (00:31:13):
You can actually create very interesting businesses for that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:31:16):
Number two is we are low on per capita income.

KUNAL SHAH (00:31:23):
So what AI can do instead of taking our jobs away, is just make us brighter.

KUNAL SHAH (00:31:28):
Satya talks about how expertise is now available in the air. So you can actually just ride on that and really make the world very equal in many many ways.

KUNAL SHAH (00:31:40):
So that's a massive opportunity and also a challenge, because I often make this joke that the largest employer of the world is ‘inefficiency’, and if you take that away too quickly, we'll have a very, very jobless world.

KUNAL SHAH (00:31:52):
So the thing is that it can be an opportunity for a country like India and also potentially a threat because if we don't start becoming great at AI.

KUNAL SHAH (00:32:01):
I was actually just telling somebody today that maybe all of our interviews should be about giving a task that they can only perform if they are very good at AI.

KUNAL SHAH (00:32:11):
And no matter what the job is, you make that the minimum criteria that if they cannot use that, leverage that, they'll become a liability in 5 years anyways.

KUNAL SHAH (00:32:23):
And the last one is, we have a very young demographic, very well positioned with access to technology, access to smartphones and so on and so forth, a lot of hunger.

KUNAL SHAH (00:32:34):
But our challenge is that it's also the first generation that is truly learning what entrepreneurship is, what risk is, and we'll make all sorts of mistakes to get there.

KUNAL SHAH (00:32:43):
And I hope we don't go into a shell after having these large scale failures that we have not seen before.

KUNAL SHAH (00:32:50):
India is not used to layoffs.

KUNAL SHAH (00:32:53):
Like the startup world is used to layoffs, but in India, if startups do layoffs, it becomes the national news and all sorts of discussions happen over here.

KUNAL SHAH (00:33:01):
So we are not there yet.

KUNAL SHAH (00:33:03):
So we are stuck between being somewhat of a collectivist or somewhat of an individualistic society.

KUNAL SHAH (00:33:10):
We are somewhere.

KUNAL SHAH (00:33:12):
India is a great remix of everything.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:15):
I love this line you just shared of “inefficiencies is the largest employer in the world”.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:22):
I totally get that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:23):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:24):
So let's talk about CRED for a bit.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:27):
So you had, I think three startups before CRED?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:31):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:31):
And then you've been building CRED for about six years now.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:34):
I'm curious just on this journey of CRED, what you've learned or changed your mind about, during this phase of your career versus previous phases.

KUNAL SHAH (00:33:45):
I think CRED's insight was actually quite simple.

KUNAL SHAH (00:33:47):
We realized that unfortunately the value of time and per capita income is concentrated with 25 million families and therefore focusing on them is important.

KUNAL SHAH (00:33:56):
And they are a lot more global in their approach versus the rest of India.

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:01):
So you have to build for them very differently.

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:05):
And I realized that the ability to focus on a customer set, which is not historically possible to do because every investor expected us to be the next China, and the only similarity of India and China was the population and nothing else was similar.

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:19):
So I think having that conviction that, “I'm going to build only for these folks and this large enough market.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:27):
Thankfully I had one success for somebody to bet.

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:30):
So our series A was $25 million.

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:32):
I would've not had that luxury if I had no success in the past because I had no product with any monetization to prove that I'm doing the right thing.

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:39):
It turned out okay, but I think I could get a lot of people to take a risk behind my insight or my thesis because I focused on the right customer category and built on it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:34:51):
But I think the few things I've learned differently is that companies that are very, very good at zero to one will not naturally become great at 10 to 100.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:00):
There are lots of different lessons to learn.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:01):
The founder has to evolve.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:03):
That’s the biggest thing that has to happen.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:05):
Most people at CRED are people who have not seen a bigger business than CRED, which comes with its benefits and costs.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:12):
So you have to gentrify the org every now and then to make people understand the value of many of these reliable things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:19):
And I often tell people that entrepreneurs are uncertainty absorbers for everybody- for employees, for investors, for customers- and therefore they get rewarded for being those people who remove uncertainty from people's lives.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:37):
But the kind of expectations keep changing at companies of scale.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:41):
For example, if you have, let's say a seed stage investor, they are very used to very high uncertainty and they're happy with some absorption.

KUNAL SHAH (00:35:51):
But as you get a growth investor, and let's say you have sovereigns on your cap table, the amount of stability you need to provide is significantly more, and therefore you need to evolve very, very differently.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:01):
So I think those are the few lessons that I've learned.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:02):
Talent, you start realizing that not everybody can scale into everything.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:07):
And you cannot expect that you can give up the 0 to 1 DNA just because you're building 10 to 100.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:12):
So how do you kind of coexist with those things?

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:15):
How do you react to big changes in the market and not become this slow company?

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:19):
And every company goes through that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:21):
I mean if you look at what Zuck went through in the last three or four years was that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:27):
I often say that he had to play the Shiva, come and do a lot of destruction to become big again.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:34):
So I think that's what founders can do, and it's not easy to do.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:39):
One of the things I've learned is that profit pools of a country tell you a lot about what the country values.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:48):
And trying to copy somebody else's profit pool to your country will not be a wise idea because the country's values are demonstrated in what profit pools exist.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:57):
Let's take an example.

KUNAL SHAH (00:36:59):
In the thousand most profitable companies in India, the number of retailers would be probably two or three.

KUNAL SHAH (00:37:06):
But if you look at the Western market, you'll see a bunch of them because it's a consumption market, plus a very high divorce rate which means you're always peacocking again in the market, you're trying to be fit and be cool and all of that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:37:19):
India has a very low divorce rate, less than 1%, are arranged marriages.

KUNAL SHAH (00:37:24):
Fashion spends, and because we have a lower female participation of labor, India is probably the only market where female fashion spends is less than men's fashion spends.

KUNAL SHAH (00:37:33):
Everywhere else, it's probably five, 6x more for them.

KUNAL SHAH (00:37:36):
So what happens is you start appreciating what the country values.

KUNAL SHAH (00:37:40):
For example, I have noticed that many patriarchal societies have a very significant market cap in financial services versus consumption.

KUNAL SHAH (00:37:50):
And these broad patterns, you start thinking about very, very differently.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:37:55):
So many lessons there.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:37:56):
I love this idea of a founder being an uncertainty absorber.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:00):
This other point you made about Zuck becoming the Shiva and destruction touches on something Brian Chesky and I chatted a bit about, how founders often start in control, very micromanaging, just driving the ship.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:13):
And then as the company grows, they delegate and empower and then things start to slow down and then they come back, play the Shiva and take control again.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:23):
Is there anything there that you've seen-

KUNAL SHAH (00:38:25):
Yeah, but that's the universe.

KUNAL SHAH (00:38:26):
The universe goes through the exact same phases.

KUNAL SHAH (00:38:28):
So if you study Indian mythology, you'll see that there's a Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh cycles and every yugg As it’s called, goes through these three phases all the time.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:38):
Beautiful.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:39):
I see.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:39):
So this is just inevitable.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:41):
This is the circle of life.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:42):
Absolutely.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:43):
Amazing.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:44):
I love how this all just ties back to your philosophy background.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:47):
I love it.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:47):
It's beautiful.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:49):
This episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights hub for product teams.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:54):
Are you working in a feature factory building filler that nobody wants?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:59):
Probably, because the sad truth is that most SaaS features are rarely or never used, costing the industry billions every year.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:07):
Let's change that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:08):
Product managers, Dovetail is holding their first industry conference, it's called Insight Out, and they want you to come over one day in San Francisco.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:18):
The product community is coming together to learn how to better leverage customer insights and build products that people actually love to use.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:25):
It's on April 11, and you can hear from product leaders from Uber, Twitch Meta and Netflix as they share their strategies for driving innovation, thriving in uncertainty and balancing customer centered work with business needs.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:39):
And here's the kicker, it's absolutely free for online tickets.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:43):
Just go to dovetail.com/lenny to register.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:47):
This is thanks to Dovetail, the best way for product teams to get the most out of customer insights.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:52):
Check it out at dovetail.com/lenny.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:56):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:56):
So, on CRED.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:57):
So here's a funny thing that happened.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:58):
I asked people on Twitter what questions to ask you on this podcast, and one of the most common questions was “When do you think you'll become profitable?”

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:40:06):
Which is interesting because when I have other CEOs that are founding a company that is, and most companies aren't profitable, nobody's asking that question.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:40:14):
So I'm just curious, why is that such a common question that comes up?

KUNAL SHAH (00:40:17):
It's fascinating.

KUNAL SHAH (00:40:19):
It's fascinating.

KUNAL SHAH (00:40:21):
As a country, most businesses were of trading, you buy something at low cost, sell at a higher price and you make profit.

KUNAL SHAH (00:40:30):
Most of our businesses, most of our family businesses were trading.

KUNAL SHAH (00:40:35):
But building a CapEx heavy distribution, monetizing it later on, focusing on high revenue growth rate versus trying to get profitability first, is not known to us.

KUNAL SHAH (00:40:47):
So when they see these large numbers of losses, there's a shock. “Why would somebody give you this kind of money?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:40:56):
And  by the way, my own dad wouldn't respect me till I was building a profitable company.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:01):
So it's not surprising that people in India have these comments, but it also comes from not understanding how businesses are built in the internet world, where VCs are giving you the capital to build distribution, unique product edge, brand, all of that stuff, and then monetize later on and monetize big and then have very large profit pools to go after.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:23):
But a lot of times this comes from not understanding this business, and I feel it'll change because many internet companies are now getting very profitable and public listed.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:36):
So we'll have a decade.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:39):
Let's understand one thing.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:40):
In the US, maybe 27-30% of the US market cap is now tech companies.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:46):
In India tech companies would probably make less than 2- 3% of the market cap.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:51):
So we are mostly, and I'm not saying India has this fabulous history of building very, very profitable tech companies.

KUNAL SHAH (00:41:57):
We are probably the first generation that will have to prove ourselves to be very large profitable companies.

KUNAL SHAH (00:42:02):
But we are still figuring out what this means.

KUNAL SHAH (00:42:05):
And the fact that this question, by the way, I can tell you one thing that, I have been asked this question by people on Twitter way more than any of my investors have ever asked me this question. This also creates an arbitrage for entrepreneurs who can actually build businesses and have the ability to raise capital and prove their business model with very high revenue growth rate and build large brands and so on and so forth.

KUNAL SHAH (00:42:29):
But I find it fascinating as well.

KUNAL SHAH (00:42:32):
Also, one thing we see fascinating in India is that there is an immense amount of trolling and doubt that will come in your comments no matter what you do.

KUNAL SHAH (00:42:42):
So if you see any founder in India, they'll post something about the thing, the comments will rarely have appreciation.

KUNAL SHAH (00:42:50):
So it feels sad because, when you see global companies do stuff, Indians will lose their shit on Apple Vision Pro and all this stuff and Twitter will go gaga over it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:01):
But I think when it comes to...and I believe envy is hyperlocal.

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:08):
We do not envy Elon Musk for all the stuff he does because he's so far away.

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:13):
But we envy our own because they were just like us not many years ago.

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:19):
And therefore envy is like wifi.

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:23):
It's like a hyperlocal service.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:43:25):
How do you stay positive and focused and not let that stuff bring you down?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:43:31):
And do you have advice for founders in India that are dealing with the same sort of feedback?

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:35):
It's funny the number of calls I've got from founders who start getting hate. I’m the go-to person to get these call because they've seen me get it for many more years.

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:45):
And I tell people that we couldn't have made it this far if we cared about criticism of everybody versus people who've done better than us.

KUNAL SHAH (00:43:58):
If somebody who's done anything better than me gives me any amount of criticism, I will absolutely flip and make all the changes and evolve.

KUNAL SHAH (00:44:08):
And I seek feedback all the time from people.

KUNAL SHAH (00:44:12):
But if I start taking feedback from everybody who does not understand the nuance and empathize with what I'm doing, I'm not saying that we should not take customer feedback, that's very different.

KUNAL SHAH (00:44:19):
But let's say somebody commenting about your business, who does not understand the nuance of it, you can't be reacting to everything.

KUNAL SHAH (00:44:27):
And I often tell people that there's a reason elements with lower valencies are called noble gases because they're hardest to get reactions from.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:38):
That's over my head, but I love it anyway.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:42):
It's so interesting.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:43):
I love all these elements you're pointing out of how different building in India is. I think people in the US have no idea about it.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:49):
And so I appreciate you getting into all these little elements.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:53):
Is there anything else around the Indian market that may surprise people before we go in a different direction about building a startup there?

KUNAL SHAH (00:44:59):
For all the challenges, India remains the most promising market that one can be building for right now because everything is going our way.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:07):
We have all sorts of digital public infrastructure, government support, all these great people doing extraordinary things, apart from the Twitter noise.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:17):
And Twitter is designed for outrage getting likes.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:21):
So I wouldn't read too much into it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:23):
But I think all of us are doing well because we have an audience set, an evolved ecosystem that is fully supporting us and really taking it forward.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:34):
So I think I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in building because of this extremely vibrant, crazy opportunity that one can learn from.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:43):
However, I often wish that I could get a one month internship with Brian and learn how to do things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:51):
And I've never had the luxury.

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:53):
I can only watch his podcast with you to learn a few things, but what if I got a chance to be there?

KUNAL SHAH (00:45:58):
And I miss that part where I've never been really trained by these extraordinary product brains or even observed them make decisions.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:08):
So I recently posted one thing that the word ‘operation theater’ comes because operating used to be a public process and people used to pay money to watch surgeries and see all the bloody gory stuff and even before anesthesia was born.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:21):
And there's so much joy in seeing somebody do their action.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:26):
And I wish there was a theater for Brian taking a product decision, Zuck taking a hard call on killing a product or seeing Tim rejecting all the ideas that they have before the GTM of a product.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:42):
I think we could benefit so much from that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:45):
And unfortunately it remains in very small circles.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:47):
And like I said, the reason I said you do a fabulous job of removing some of the information asymmetry and kind of making it more democratic.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:54):
But there is so much more that we all could learn.

KUNAL SHAH (00:46:57):
And I feel extremely envious of many people who have the opportunity to work with the best of the best because, many of us from India never had the luxury. We had to figure out everything on our own.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:10):
Wow.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:10):
How cool would that be just to have a camera in some of those meetings just as a learning experience, because very few people are in those rooms and there's so much to learn.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:21):
I think though people will find, “Holy shit, one, this is how decisions are made, what is going on?”

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:26):
And two is , “I don't want to work for this person.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:29):
This sounds very difficult and stressful.”

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:33):
Those are probably some takeaways that will emerge.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:36):
Kind of along these lines, something that comes up a lot in your talks and work is curiosity.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:43):
You have a show called CRED curious.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:46):
You often talk about the power of curiosity.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:48):
I'm just curious, why is curiosity so important to you and why is it important for other people to always stay curious and what value is there?

KUNAL SHAH (00:47:57):
I think a curious person is somebody who is constantly demonstrating that they are not proud of their expertise, and they will demonstrate extraordinary amounts of excitement when they face a problem which they have no clue how to solve.

KUNAL SHAH (00:48:17):
And therefore a lot of people stop growing because they want to constantly demonstrate their expertise versus demonstrating their curiosity.

KUNAL SHAH (00:48:27):
Because, curiosity should come from security because imagine- I'm the founder, CEO of this company and this group of 60 people on WhatsApp, somebody posts something and asks a dumb question, “What does this word mean?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:48:41):
You need to have the security to feel okay with it, but a lot of people out off insecurity try to demonstrate expertise and do it or Google to not ask these people.

KUNAL SHAH (00:48:52):
And I think that slows down the compounding growth and I think it keeps you from being very good at adapting.

KUNAL SHAH (00:49:02):
So it's funny, I was recently. GPT is my favorite thing to keep asking random questions because now I don't need to really worry about Google having those questions answered around because I can ask the GPT.

KUNAL SHAH (00:49:12):
So I recently asked the question: which species or animals have survived for more than 100 million years without changing too much and what is common in all of them?

KUNAL SHAH (00:49:22):
So GPT came up with an interesting answer which says that sharks, horseshoe crabs, crocodiles, and all of these animals have survived to do this thing.

KUNAL SHAH (00:49:34):
So three distinct traits were, one, ability to reduce metabolism at will.

KUNAL SHAH (00:49:43):
It's fascinating.

KUNAL SHAH (00:49:45):
I can bring down my metabolism by 1:20 or a crazy, crazy scale that they can bring the metabolism down.

KUNAL SHAH (00:49:54):
By the way, ancient yogis have demonstrated this as well.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:00):
It comes from the same yogic practice.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:02):
The second thing is about, and if you think about companies, the context is the same.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:06):
If COVID came, you could slow down your metabolism and survive, right?

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:12):
Or you burned your way out and disappeared.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:16):
The second thing that was interesting was the very high conversion rate on every attempt to secure food.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:25):
They don't go around chasing randomly and doing things.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:27):
They have a very high conversion rate, which means high judgment and the deadliest bite.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:35):
So they'll not chase many options, but if they chase something, they will have the biggest bite and they'll convert it.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:41):
And the third thing that was more interesting was that they have survived all sorts of crazy environmental changes, just adapting. And adaptation comes from curiosity.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:56):
And you could see those people.

KUNAL SHAH (00:50:57):
In COVID, there were two sets of people, who were completely gone into a shell and there were those who were curious.

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:03):
“Okay, so what do I do with this?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:05):
“What happens now?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:06):
“Do I need to change something?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:07):
“Do I need to tweak something?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:09):
So the ability to change very quickly.

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:13):
I often feel that curiosity is that demonstration of the ability to adapt and learn, and you only create more information asymmetry.

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:25):
To me, wealth is nothing but information asymmetry.

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:27):
All the best companies in the world have unfair information asymmetry.

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:33):
And that comes from curiosity. Because you're constantly collecting dots, connecting dots, collecting dots, connecting dots, and end up creating this unique edge for yourself and information asymmetry for yourself.

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:48):
And if you assume that “I have collected enough,” no human life is going to be enough to connect and connect all the dots.

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:56):
We'll never be able to get..

KUNAL SHAH (00:51:58):
And sometimes I envy the stuff that you do because you are efficiently connecting and collecting dots by having the luxury of all these people to talk to, and you are making more dots getting connected.

KUNAL SHAH (00:52:12):
So your information asymmetry is growing.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:14):
Wait until you IPO, and then someday maybe leave CRED and then you could start this podcast with everyone like this and connect all the dots.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:22):
And I think that's a reference to Danny Meyer who's the founder of all these fancy restaurants and big on hospitality and has this phrase “Always be collecting dots”, I think ABCD, I’ll link to that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:33):
Yeah.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:35):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:35):
Wait, this is really interesting, this list of what are the common traits of the most long-lasting animals?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:41):
They can lower their metabolism at will, they have a high conversion rate to get food, and they've survived many types of environments.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:49):
And I think there's a lot you can transform as you've done, to startups and leaders.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:54):
This could be its own…

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:55):
if you haven't written about this, this would be a cool blog post.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:59):
I'm curious who you look up to in business, either in India and outside India.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:53:05):
Who comes to mind where you're like, I really inspired, I'm inspired by these folks?

KUNAL SHAH (00:53:10):
I often tell people that I hate the word ‘favorite’ because it tells me to become limited in my mind.

KUNAL SHAH (00:53:16):
So I stay away from ‘favorite’, but I learn all the time from everybody.

KUNAL SHAH (00:53:22):
And there are so many people to learn from across the world and in history, in the recent past and every time you'll discover fascinating, extraordinary things about them.

KUNAL SHAH (00:53:35):
So I don't think I have a person.

KUNAL SHAH (00:53:38):
I am this person who thinks about about: ”How did they solve this hard problem.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:53:42):
So one of the things that we started doing recently and not very ritualistic about it so far is, I ask myself and my key reportees every month, we go around the table and ask ourselves, ”What are the hardest problems we solved last month?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:00):
And it's very hard to come up with an answer.

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:04):
And if you do this to the product leaders, just go around and ask, “What are the hard problems you solved last month?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:11):
You'll realize that we all stay very busy and displacement is hard.

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:15):
But if you notice extraordinarily successful people, they'll have a lot more content to talk about every month, every quarter because they're obsessed with making that big displacement and it does not come by being busy.

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:35):
And that's another thing that you cannot chase the big thing.

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:37):
You don't see a crocodile being busy.

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:40):
You see a crocodile just waiting patiently at the watering hole for that best meal and have the deadliest bite for that.

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:49):
So the beautiful definition of predators I read was “one who burns the least amount of calories to earn the most amount of calories.”

KUNAL SHAH (00:54:59):
So how do you become that?

KUNAL SHAH (00:55:00):
And I think when I meet people who are extraordinary at that, and it comes in all shapes and forms, I learn something from them.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:07):
So in these meetings you have, are you judging people's success based on how many hard problems they solve?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:13):
Now that they've heard this, they're going to be like, I need more.

KUNAL SHAH (00:55:17):
Because if you're a senior, what is the role of a senior person?

KUNAL SHAH (00:55:21):
You have to be the chief problem solver.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:24):
I love that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:24):
I often think of leaders as professional firefighters who have just endless fires to put out.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:31):
Kind of along the lines of people and where you learn from, are there any sources of content?

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:36):
This is actually an audience question on Twitter.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:38):
Anurag Verma asks this, “What are your favorite sources of content to learn from in terms of what's happening in the world and what to pay attention to?”

KUNAL SHAH (00:55:47):
I wish I could think of an answer.

KUNAL SHAH (00:55:50):
My method of collecting information is mostly about, I come up with conjectures in my head and then I go all over the place to find out if there is proof if what I'm saying is true or not.

KUNAL SHAH (00:56:04):
For example, I recently came up with a conjecture that everybody who has been successful in the history of business of vices, historically has done a lot of philanthropy to create a good image for themselves, and therefore is being treated as a respected citizen versus being treated as a person who did vices to make wealth.

KUNAL SHAH (00:56:24):
And then I asked GPT to come up with 50 people who did that and what were their vices?

KUNAL SHAH (00:56:30):
How did they change the reputation by doing lots of philanthropy and all of that stuff?

KUNAL SHAH (00:56:36):
Then a thing happens.

KUNAL SHAH (00:56:37):
And then I research in all sorts of directions. And I have no boundaries if I go to chemistry or physics or human behavior to discover some universal principles.

KUNAL SHAH (00:56:48):
So my method of learning is to constantly come up with conjectures from the dots that you have connected and then absolutely work hard to find proof of it and then use that to connect to the next dot.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:01):
So I often tell people that every book you read makes your brain poorer to read the next book.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:10):
That's the purpose of books, but that's true for every single thing we learn.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:13):
It makes our brain poorerfor the next thing that we are supposed to learn.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:57:17):
Is there a recent example of that where you got super sucked into some topic?

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:20):
Well, it's my daily life.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:22):
I get sucked into topics every now and then.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:26):
For example, I've been thinking about second order effects of AI and what happens to countries and jobs and how to expect some of these things to change, not change, rate of change, rate of skill change.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:39):
I got recently obsessed with what happens to lab grown diamonds if they become big?

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):
Does it kill diamonds?

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):
Does it make diamonds bigger?

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:46):
And then I looked at parallels.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:48):
So, the pearl industry was very big before culture.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:53):
Cultured pearls  came and the high status of pearls disappeared because everybody could have pearls.

KUNAL SHAH (00:57:59):
But not too long ago, pearls were a very royal thing . Every prince and princess used to have pearls around them, but as soon as it was easy to manufacture in a lab, it lost its value.

KUNAL SHAH (00:58:13):
So then  I think should I be shorting or going long on diamonds thinking about what happens?

KUNAL SHAH (00:58:19):
But there'll be a temporary period of making a lot of money on lab grown diamonds, which will kill... it'll become parasitic on the status of diamonds and destroy all of the profit pools.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:31):
You heard it here first, time to buy some diamond futures.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:35):
I feel like there's no one in the world ChatGPT impacted more than you considering how much you want to spend digging into random topics.

KUNAL SHAH (00:58:43):
I often wonder, Lenny, that if you took the most serious people and made their GPT searches public, a lot of people will learn because the problem of GPT is now it'll make the people with great questions do well, versus people who are looking for basic answers.

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:00):
So I think the world is going to be unfair to people who will ask great questions.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:05):
Interesting.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):
Well, I got to ask you, is there any advice you have for asking great questions that has helped you in your work and career and life?

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:14):
Whenever somebody has many choices and they make the right choice in whatever domain they have.

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:21):
For example, let's say you could hire anybody but you hired great people, or let's say you could have married anybody, but you married a great person and so on and so forth. Everybody has many choices to make.

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:32):
How do they make choices for that domain of expertise?

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:38):
And I think that is the most, and many times they're not going to be able to explain how they make great choices.

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:43):
They'll have to really go into that because they don't really have their mental models figured out.

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:49):
They cannot articulate, they cannot coach, they cannot explain.

KUNAL SHAH (00:59:51):
But if you can figure out how they make great decisions in general, in whatever domain of work they're doing, you'll find many interesting insights coming over there.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:01):
The other good question to ask is about second order thinking.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:06):
What do they think will happen to the world and why did they come to that conclusion?

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:11):
And you see that full chain of thoughts is very powerful.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:15):
For example, second order thinking is known to be the most powerful trait to predict the success of somebody.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:22):
But I often wonder what happened in the childhood of people who became great at second order thinking.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:30):
And that question is not fully discovered or discussed yet.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:34):
And I've found some loose examples such as if you played strategy games or only physical games as a strong correlation to building

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:42):
So rigor came from physical games, but second order thinking came from playing strategy games as a kid.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:48):
And if you had both, you could do really well in general because you have discipline and second order thinking together.

KUNAL SHAH (01:00:55):
Then did you ever have an exercise of looking at history?

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:01):
For example, one of the things I recommend for parents to do with their kids, I call it the ‘Whyfi school’, is ask them  one ‘why’ question every meal and let them come back with answers the next day.

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:15):
For example, “Why do humans wear jewelry” and ”Why is something a certain way?”

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:23):
And let them go into the full depth of history and find out.

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:29):
Why is it so expensive to advertise in the Super Bowl?

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:32):
And so on and so forth.

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:33):
You just take one question.

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:34):
And if you train them on why, they evolve at a very different rate because how, what are the questions which do not evolve at a much higher rate, because ‘why’ is the deep question and it breaks a lot of things in your head.

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:48):
Or another question about origin stories that “How did elevators come into being?” and "what made your phones happen?”

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:54):
“What made microphones happen and why is it called microphone and why is it called a phone?”

KUNAL SHAH (01:01:59):
And if you just want to go into this depth, you'll see people build second order thinking automatically because either you go into history and see second order thinking coming along with that, or you play games that train your brain for second order thinking with the spectrum.

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:13):
But that's a broad range of things that I think people should be asking.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:17):
I'm looking forward to Kunal’s children's raising book, like a book to help you raise kids.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:23):
This could be your future.

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:24):
I don't have kids so I can run experiments on everybody else's kids.

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:27):
So it's a great thing to do.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:29):
I feel like with these questions, I think the rule has to be you can't just ask ChatGPT for the answer if the block it-

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:34):
Actually it's not bad.

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:36):
I think you should encourage it because we have to assume that we are going to be all co-pilots of AI now.

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:42):
What you have to do is derive the second order insight that, “Okay, this is true.

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:46):
Where is the similarity of this in somewhere else?”

KUNAL SHAH (01:02:49):
Give me an example of this found somewhere else, and so on and so forth.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:54):
Amazing.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:55):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:56):
I have just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:00):
First, let's visit the contrarian corner.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:03):
I'm curious. What's something that you believe that very few other people would agree with you on and why do you hold that belief?

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:12):
Our understanding of wealth and what wealth is, is flawed.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:16):
To me, wealth is nothing but storage of energy.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:20):
And therefore the reason wealth is not zero sum is because energy is, and we are just finding  ways to convert energy to our advantage.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:28):
We are the only species that has managed to convert all forms of energy to our advantage.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:32):
Kinetic energy and fuel and sound and solar.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:35):
No other species has done this.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:37):
And therefore, since the industrial revolution, our wealth has gone like this and continues to be like that.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:42):
AI and nuclear fission and all this stuff will kind of take us right there.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:47):
So I have a strong view that we will never, never have equality of wealth.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:55):
In fact, chasing that is actually a bad idea.

KUNAL SHAH (01:03:58):
But if you let people do well and chase wealth, they have enough wealth for everybody else and we could help a lot of people out.

KUNAL SHAH (01:04:06):
And I think it's complicated because we can have all these democratic arguments that wealth is concentrated and all that, but that's the physics of wealth.

KUNAL SHAH (01:04:16):
It'll always be concentrated.

KUNAL SHAH (01:04:18):
You change these mediums, companies, countries.

KUNAL SHAH (01:04:23):
To me, wealth is nothing but an entropic complexity that'll keep changing its form and shape.

KUNAL SHAH (01:04:29):
You can keep fighting it or accept its physics and reap the benefit of that physics.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:34):
I think Elon had this interesting point that wealth is just a database where everyone's wealth I guess is just a row in the database and here's how much everyone has and you're just transferring numbers around and that's the whole economy.

KUNAL SHAH (01:04:49):
No, but the nuance that is important is that you can actually increase the database size infinitely.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:54):
That's true.

KUNAL SHAH (01:04:55):
And therefore his vision of the sun's energy, if you really convert all the energy to our advantage, the amount of wealth we will create for humans is disproportionate.

KUNAL SHAH (01:05:04):
And all the species that are managed to collaborate and cooperate to create wealth, for example, let's define wealth as biomass.

KUNAL SHAH (01:05:12):
So let's say ants and bacteria and humans are the only few things that have the largest biomass on this planet because we figured out how to make energy work to our advantage.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:23):
Wow.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:24):
I love all the directions we've gone.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:27):
Probably the last question, is there a story of failure in your career that would be interesting to share?

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:34):
Something that taught you an important lesson?

KUNAL SHAH (01:05:36):
It's a series of failures.

KUNAL SHAH (01:05:39):
I think there is no escape for anybody who's done anything in life, not failed a lot, like every day, every thing.

KUNAL SHAH (01:05:46):
But I would say that many initiatives, many products, companies that I've built have absolutely failed, hirings that have failed, trust broken, betrayals.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:01):
So I think there is no end to it.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:04):
But I think entrepreneurs have this weird ability to forget about failures and almost turn that into a lesson that you hold, and you forget the story.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:21):
For example, COVID has literally no memory for me.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:24):
I just don't remember what was COVID.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:27):
It's just a blank in my head right now.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:30):
And I think that humans are great at forgetting the memory of failure, but remember the lesson from failure.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:36):
But I think I'm constantly learning, and I often believe that life is too short to make all our mistakes ourselves.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:43):
So we should be learning from other people's failures as well.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:46):
And a lot of times we don't do that because we believe that we are special, nothing like that will happen to us, but as humans, we should be learning.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:55):
I would say that my life started from a failure.

KUNAL SHAH (01:06:58):
My family went through a severe financial crisis.

KUNAL SHAH (01:07:01):
I had to start working from age 15 and I feel till date, I'm just trying to escape that failure that happened in the family.

KUNAL SHAH (01:07:10):
So I think many of us are just fighting that initial large failure that we've had and don't want to be anywhere near that.

KUNAL SHAH (01:07:21):
And although we are significantly far away from that, the feeling is exactly that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:27):
Circles back to one of our first few questions about the chips on shoulders driving a lot of motivation.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:33):
There's this phrase, ”Chips on shoulders drive chips in pockets.”

KUNAL SHAH (01:07:39):
That's interesting.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):
Yeah.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):
Is there anything more you want to share about that early challenge you ran into or is that something you've shared often?

KUNAL SHAH (01:07:46):
No, I mean I've shared that enough, but I used to not talk about it before because I used to think that I would get some sympathy for that.

KUNAL SHAH (01:07:54):
And only in the recent past did I speak about it because I want people to realize that I was not some gifted kid who had some rich parents who made me extraordinarily bright and put me in great schools and colleges and I made my way through that.

KUNAL SHAH (01:08:12):
I used to not talk  about it earlier because there's a lot of tendency to give sympathy to those people who say, "Oh, this guy had struggled."

KUNAL SHAH (01:08:17):
And I don't want to be given any credit for playing that poverty card or this card or struggling for food card.

KUNAL SHAH (01:08:29):
That's not an excuse.

KUNAL SHAH (01:08:32):
There are so many people in the world who've done extraordinarily well because they had the gift of struggle.

KUNAL SHAH (01:08:37):
And I often tell people that this is the biggest curse of successful parents, that that's the only gift they'll not be able to give to their kids, the gift of struggle that they had.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:46):
Wow.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):
I think about that a lot.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):
We have a kid, he's eight months now, and so I'm trying to figure out the balance of struggle versus making life easy and great, a new challenge for me to figure out.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:57):
Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else, Kunal, you wanted to share or leave listeners with?

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):
Anything?

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):
Any last nuggets of thoughts?

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:04):
Well, I would love for the listeners from different fields of product to share what you're learning without being fearful of the judgment of your peers, because there are many, many people who are learning only because you share your evolution and your thoughts.

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:22):
And I believe that a lot more could be contributing.

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:25):
And a lot of your listeners are really bright people.

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:28):
If they all shared, many people from many places in the world would learn and achieve some amount of success.

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:38):
Thanks to your sharing.

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:39):
Amazing.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:40):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:43):
Are you ready?

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:45):
All set.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:46):
Let's do it.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:47):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:53):
It keeps changing a lot, but my books are usually around understanding human behavior.

KUNAL SHAH (01:09:58):
And I keep changing based on the person, but I think it's the biggest subject.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:03):
All our customers, all our investors, all our employees, all our relationships are all humans.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:08):
And the subject that we are weakest on is human behavior.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:11):
And how do we live this life?

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:13):
We are playing life on extremely hard mode if you don't learn human behavior.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:17):
So I would say that's one thing.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:19):
The second thing, evolutionary biology, teaches a lot about how species evolve and how they make decisions and what are the core motivations that drive everybody.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:28):
So that's another one I would recommend.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:30):
And I don't want to make a recommendation because I can barely finish a book to be honest.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:36):
So I believe in drifting and getting deeper into topics.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:39):
So understanding the topics versus trying to say, give me these three books and I'm going to be good.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:43):
And the last one I would say, is that anything that can make you learn something about their journey versus their success.

KUNAL SHAH (01:10:53):
So sometimes autobiographies are too celebratory in some ways, but if you can just kind of understand how… any book that can teach you about how people recover from a setback in great detail is a great book to learn from.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:11):
An audience member on Twitter actually asked a similar question along these lines, if there's one book that you could read over and over and over, what would that be?

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:20):
Is there one?

KUNAL SHAH (01:11:21):
I absolutely don't believe in reading over and over because I believe that we are evolving.

KUNAL SHAH (01:11:29):
You might discover the same stuff coming from different books and you would say, "Oh, I can categorize this in my brain again and again."

KUNAL SHAH (01:11:34):
But I think we tend to become believers, and it becomes too religious if you repeat.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:47):
Yeah.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:49):
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

KUNAL SHAH (01:11:54):
I love Oppenheimer because of the struggles and Nolan's craft of making the movies, but nothing in the recent past that I feel is right up there.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:12:05):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:11):
I like to ask a hypothetical second order thinking question.

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:15):
For example, if everybody who has taken a COVID vaccine dies tonight, what happens in 12 months from now?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:23):
Can you explain the world- from what happens to money, what happens to law?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:28):
What happens to countries?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:29):
What happens to the military?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:30):
What happens to the stock market?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:32):
What happens to the order of things?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:35):
And I would say less than 10% of really smart people can have really good answers.

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:43):
So it tells you how good they are at second order thinking.

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:48):
But the questions can keep changing.

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:49):
For example, if you said that, what if arranged marriages were banned in India, and you got capital punishment for doing arranged marriages?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:57):
What happens to the country?

KUNAL SHAH (01:12:59):
How do we change from there?

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:01):
Like some absurd scenarios, but then what happens after that?

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:13:05):
Not to give away your secret sauce, but what do you look for in an answer that gives you a sense there?

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:09):
The range of things that they could go into and think about-  if this happens, B happens and then C happens.

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:18):
The leaps they could make.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:13:20):
And just so people understand, when you're talking about second order thinking, what's the simplest way to describe that concept?

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:26):
I think the simplest way to think about this is being able to correctly judge the butterfly effect of an event as close as possible.

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:37):
For example, a lot of people in the stock market use that to say how stocks will go up and down.

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:44):
There's something that has happened in the market.

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:46):
“Oh, there is a war now with Russia, then what happens to the market?”

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:52):
Can you be good at predicting that?

KUNAL SHAH (01:13:54):
But in everything in life, if this happens, a lot of people hate this because it's very taxing to the brain.

KUNAL SHAH (01:14:02):
The brain absolutely hates second order thinking unless you've trained your brain with second order thinking all the time that it looks forward to it.

KUNAL SHAH (01:14:10):
So you convert this into a hate versus a reward cycle, and that comes with probably doing it early on in your life.

KUNAL SHAH (01:14:19):
Later on, people hate doing second order thinking.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:22):
It is.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:23):
Yes.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:23):
That sounds like a lot of work for the brain.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:26):
Okay.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:26):
Just a few more questions.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:27):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered and that you really love?

KUNAL SHAH (01:14:32):
I'm looking forward to my Vision Pro coming soon.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:37):
It's a future favorite product.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:39):
We have actually Boz from Meta coming on as the next guest in my recording.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:43):
I'm not sure when they come out in sequence, but we're going to talk about his thoughts.

KUNAL SHAH (01:14:48):
The most fascinating thing that I saw was Zuck talking about the utility of Meta being better than Vision Pro and their product.

KUNAL SHAH (01:14:59):
And that's exactly going to work well for Apple because when you try to make the product more utilitarian, it loses status.

KUNAL SHAH (01:15:08):
And if you study animals, you realize that the one which gets the highest mating success is the one which can demonstrate the ability to waste resources and not be very efficient with resources.

KUNAL SHAH (01:15:20):
And therefore people who are known to buy a product that is wasteful will actually own higher status.

KUNAL SHAH (01:15:26):
And I think Zuck made it actually quite easy for Apple to demonstrate their superior positioning by saying that, "Oh, we are not as efficient, we are not as cheap.

KUNAL SHAH (01:15:35):
We are not for everybody."

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:37):
Wow.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:37):
Just continue to blow minds even on our lightning round.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:42):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends and family, find useful in work or in life?

KUNAL SHAH (01:15:50):
It's not a favorite motto, but I think we truly are transient and we are very lucky to have this life that we have and we have to make the most out of it.

KUNAL SHAH (01:16:01):
And all these struggles will mean nothing.

KUNAL SHAH (01:16:05):
I often tell people that you should wish for your life to be so great that you have collected the highest amount of content when you are old, and you have no end to the stories that you can talk about.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:16):
That reminds me of a book I once read that really had an impact on me where somebody was trying to make a movie of their life and the producer was like, "There's nothing.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:24):
There's no good movie here.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:25):
You have not done enough interesting things."

KUNAL SHAH (01:16:27):
I love it.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:29):
And so he turned his lens of what to do in life, by thinking what would make a great story.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:36):
And so he just started to do a a great story, something where you overcome challenges and achieve something you wanted.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:41):
And so that became his life motto.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:43):
“I'm going to try hard things and overcome them.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:45):
And that's going to be my life.”

KUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):
I love it.

KUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):
I love it.

KUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):
I love it.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:48):
I'll link to that book in the show notes.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:51):
Final question, do you have this series on Twitter that you call Monday Motivations?

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:56):
I'm curious what's motivating you these days?

KUNAL SHAH (01:16:58):
I find the internet is filled with all these people trying to give fake motivation and make money off that stuff.

KUNAL SHAH (01:17:04):
And it's almost like a drug for people to feel, ”Oh my God, there's motivation, I'm going to do well.”

KUNAL SHAH (01:17:11):
I just wanted to remind people that all success comes from an extraordinary amount of pain and struggle and hard work, and there is no shortcut to anything material coming in life.

KUNAL SHAH (01:17:22):
And so the Monday  motivation post comes as the anti-motivation post because the world is filled with... I believe that the biggest profit making scheme that I've seen in recent times is to tell people to love themselves and they'll pay you money for saying that.

KUNAL SHAH (01:17:40):
And I think the best way to love yourself is to keep evolving.

KUNAL SHAH (01:17:44):
So my motivation comes from evolution, connecting dots, solving harder problems than I've solved in the past.

KUNAL SHAH (01:17:51):
And I think life is ultimately a game where you want to feel that your levels have changed and your skills have changed constantly.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:17:59):
Kunal, you are wonderful.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:01):
Thank you so much for being here.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:03):
Two final questions.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:03):
Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on some of this stuff?

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:07):
And how can listeners be useful to you?

KUNAL SHAH (01:18:09):
You can find me on social media.

KUNAL SHAH (01:18:10):
Look for Kunal Shah, you'll find me everywhere.

KUNAL SHAH (01:18:13):
I usually have a different personality on each social media.

KUNAL SHAH (01:18:16):
And in terms of being helpful, keep tagging me on interesting things that you discover that gave you that moment of, ”Oh my God, I did not know this.”

KUNAL SHAH (01:18:25):
I would love that.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:27):
Amazing.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:28):
Kunal, again, thank you so much for being here.

KUNAL SHAH (01:18:31):
Thank you so much for having me.

LENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:32):

# What sets great teams apart | Lane Shackleton (CPO of Coda)

## Transcript

Lane Shackleton (00:00:00):
Moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit. I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous, in my opinion, way to ask this question. A much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:00:51):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Lane Shackleton. Lane is Chief Product Officer at Coda where he's held the role for over eight years. Before that, he was Group Product Manager at YouTube, a Product Specialist at Google, and as you'll hear, he started his career as an Alaskan mountain guide and then as a manual reviewer of Google AdWords ads. Lane is an incredibly deep thinker, very first principles oriented, and has built an incredible product team and culture at Coda. In part, he's done that by studying the principles and rituals of great product leaders and great product teams. In our conversation, Lane shares what he's learned, what he's found great PMs and great teams do differently. He shares a bunch of his favorite rituals and principles, how you can implement them on your own team, plus a really clever and unique way of understanding if you're making progress in your career, plus so much more. I could talk to Lane for hours, but we tried to keep this to under an hour and a half. With that, I bring you Lane Shackleton after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:55):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:02:41):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:03:03):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Calm, Quora and Modern Treasury trust Vanta to help build, scale, manage and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC2, ISO 27,001, GDPR, HIPAA and many more, Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders.

(00:04:04):
Lane, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lane Shackleton (00:04:07):
So glad to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:09):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've always really admired the way that you write about product, the way you think about product, and it feels like Coda has one of the strongest and also the most thoughtful product teams out there. And so I am really excited to have you on here and learn from what you've learned over the years. My first question is completely unrelated. I have to ask. Your last name's Shackleton. Any relation to a certain very famous Antarctic explorer?

Lane Shackleton (00:04:36):
Yeah. It's probably distant at best. I wish it was close. I wish I could claim it was my father or grandfather. But I definitely grew up with those stories and reading a lot about him as a kid. In high school we read Endurance, which is a great book if you haven't read it. It's an amazing story. Very inspiring how he put people first and brought back all of his men from this journey to the South Pole. So have taken a lot of lessons from that, but that's as close as I can come to the greatness of Ernest Shackleton.

Lenny (00:05:09):
Okay. So there's a connection. When I think of Shackleton, I also think of the ad that he ran for recruiting people to join his journey. Low chance of survival, incredibly hard, chance for glory if you succeed, something like that.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:23):
It's a wonderful ad. I think I had a mug of that when I was a kid. Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:28):
Amazing. Okay. So on that same topic, I noticed maybe your first job was a mountain guide in Alaska. Was that inspired by this legacy? And also why did you decide not to pursue that and get into product management? Completely different life.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:42):
Yeah. Yeah. Very, very different. Very different time. Didn't have kids back then. I think I was convinced at the time I wanted a career outside. Just loved spending time in the mountains and climbing, things like that. To be honest, I wasn't the best guide. There were a lot of amazing guides out there that just had ... They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person. And the reason that you do that is because if someone falls in a crevasse, you want to be able to stop them or pull them out.

(00:06:48):
So I was roped to a very nice client that I was guiding and he fell pretty close to the top on our way down. And luckily we were able to self-arrest and arrest that fall. But I spent probably the next six hours walking down that mountain thinking the same thing over and over again, which is I really don't want to die roped to someone that I barely know and don't trust or love. So that was the last season that I guided. But tons of great memories and learnings and I think it impacted my life in a pretty significant way.

Lenny (00:07:29):
Damn. Software much lower stakes. I guess just while we're on this topic, is there any parallels or big lesson you learned from that experience that you bring to product?

Lane Shackleton (00:07:37):
One is just preparation. I think when you go climbing or when you guide climbing, you spend months and months preparing for usually a few days of climbing. So there's that kind of preparation. There's also just a million checklists. So before you go on an expedition, you may check a checklist of all your equipment, stuff like that a dozen times or more. So you ensure redundancy across all your systems. So that was definitely a parallel. The other thing I think about a lot is just how to stay calm in challenging or scary scenarios. We had another instance where I had a client pull a big chunk of rock off and break their feet and I was the junior guide on that particular instance and the more senior guide looked at me, looked at the situation and was like, "Okay, we're getting this guy out of here right now." Put him on his back and we basically took turns carrying him out for a couple miles I'll just never forget instances like that where the clarity of stay calm, assess the situation, prioritize, take action. There's a mini version of that when you're building software, I think. So experiences like that, I think, even though I only did it for a handful of summers, were pretty profound.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Yeah. What a very different life that life path would've been.

Lane Shackleton (00:09:11):
Pre kids. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Oh, man. So you mentioned your writing, you mentioned that this is something you want to write about. Shifting to the core topic of our chat, it's very clear that you spent a lot of time studying how great product managers operate and how great product teams operate. You've been doing a bunch of writing on the principles of great product management and also the rituals of great teams. And so I want to spend a bunch of time trying to extract as much as I can from your learning so that listeners can learn. Essentially what are principles of great product managers, what are rituals of great teams and generally how do the best teams operate? And my first question is just why is this something that you started doing? What pulled you into spending so much time and effort trying to understand how the best teams and people operate?

Lane Shackleton (00:09:53):
Yeah. Yeah. I've been asking myself that question a little bit lately. There's a few reasons. One reason is I just found myself giving a similar set of advice in one on ones. And so I think anytime you find as a leader yourself repeating the same lessons, it should be a good flag to say like, oh, I should probably scale this in some way. And as you know, as soon as you write something down, you have to clarify your own thinking and so it becomes very useful for that. And I don't think I quite expected how useful it would be in that sense. Writing something down and then putting it out there, you start to get feedback back of where you might've been right or where you might not be right. And so for me it's been a good learning experience there as well. I think the second reason is I've always been pretty frustrated with career ladders. Most companies have career ladders with 10 or 15 levels and as soon as they hit some scale levels, there's levels between levels and I feel like I looked at the one at Google and you needed a PhD to decipher it and interpret how to operate within it.

(00:11:11):
And so that's one piece of the construct. If you think more broadly though, they aren't consistent across companies, so now you're in a situation where you're in your version of the rat race. And so I found that I basically wanted to have a broader set of principles that transcended level. So things that could be true when you are an ICPM starting your career and things that can also be true when you're the head of product or running a product team or things like that. That's one. I won't rant further on that but I think that's one piece of it.

(00:11:49):
And then I think the last reason I'll mention is I was pretty inspired by a talk that is by this guy named Brett Victor, who's like a prototyper thinker. May have heard of his work. He has this talk called Inventing on Principle. And in the early days of Coda, one of our first designers, this guy Jeremy Britten, showed this talk to the company and my mind was blown. And I think it was one of those examples of someone developing a clear view of what principles they should operate with and then following that principle. And it was just a meta example of how important it is and how impactful it can be when you decide on a principle and then follow it. And so ever since then I've been thinking what are my principles as it pertains to building software and other things. So those are the three reasons that led me to start writing these things down.

Lenny (00:12:49):
Amazing. We're going to find that talk and link to it in the show notes. I want to ask about what principles you've come to, but I also want to understand how you actually ended up doing ladders and performance review stuff at Coda. Would it be better to talk about that later after we go through some of these things or is there something you want to share first of just how you think about it at Coda?

Lane Shackleton (00:13:06):
When we were doing career ladders, first of all, we put it off for quite a bit of time and that was based on the advice of a lot of other leaders that said as soon as you introduce this, then the incentives flip from being company focused to being individual focused. So I think we delayed it for a good bit of time. There came a time where we decided, "Hey look, we really do need to provide better guidance here about what it means to grow and what it means to be great." And so about the same time we were doing the levels thing I started writing down some of the principles that I've been publishing. One of the things that I think about a lot when talking about levels is just how to keep everyone oriented toward their team and their company. And I think that we've done a really good job of that over the years. So levels aren't by any means at the forefront of any company discussion. In fact, we don't use titles that much.

Lenny (00:14:11):
You said that it's not specific to role. Do you mean the same leveling attributes are the same from design and product and engineering?

Lane Shackleton (00:14:19):
We basically have five levels and we call them role stages and they go from apprentice to principal. So apprentice is ... Rope analogy here is learns about rope. Practitioner is can tie basic knots, shown complex knots. Given a problem, they can do it. Career is you can calculate rope strength. You know a lot about knots. Principal is basically invented nylon. So the bar is really, really high for principal in these levels and I think that that's appropriate. It should be aspirational that the bar is exceptionally high at the highest level of our role stages. I find it's a pretty good process to draw maybe a little bit of contrast with other companies. I think most other companies, especially large companies have 10 to 15 levels. I think we've made a really conscious choice to have only five. I think the other bit of contrast I would draw is basically role stages are not visible across the whole company. We're not showing levels of any individual PM or designer, and that's partially because we just don't want to put a big focus on it. And then probably the biggest difference is we have a centralized compensation committee and that's who decides compensation and so it's not the manager that drives your compensation. So those are some differences.

Lenny (00:15:52):
Super cool. I've never seen it done this way before. I think it's an awesome example of first principles thinking, which I see a lot come out from your product team. And then just to make sure I heard you right, these five stages are roughly the same across role, so designers have the same five and they're described similarly.

Lane Shackleton (00:16:08):
That's right. They're described similarly at a high level, but then the specifics if you get into it are a little bit different.

Lenny (00:16:15):
Okay. I'm going to ask about what the principles are, or a few of them that you can share. But one other very tactical question. At what size of product teams, say just PMs, did you start to develop this framework?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:26):
We were probably at 20-ish PMs and designers when we did that.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Okay. So let me just ask, what are some of these principles you've narrowed it on as principles of great product managers?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:38):
Maybe it's helpful to start with a little higher level context on the unifying thesis. I think the unifying thesis is the core job of a product person in general is to turn ambiguity into clarity. And if you think about the job of a product leader or a product manager, everything is ambiguous all the time. It's like what's my role on this team? What problem are we solving? Who's the target customer? What prototype is going to solve this particular problem? So it's literally everything. And so if you're going to do the job well, you really need to get good at spotting ambiguity and turning it into clarity. And so the obvious question that follows from that is okay, great, that sounds like a great Hallmark card, but how do you actually do that? And so I think the principles that I've been writing down are very personal. They're my take on how to do this.

(00:17:41):
So the first one that I wrote about was systems not goals. And one of the ways that I started this post ... I'm a big fan of getting inspiration from outside of tech and so one of the stories that I tell is basically the story of Jerry Seinfeld. If you haven't seen the documentary Comedian, it's amazing, it's definitely worth watching. But the story goes, he's done Seinfeld the show and he's got all this material from the last 15 years and he comes in one day and he says, "Look, I'm going to throw away all my material and I'm going to start fresh." And this is unheard of in comedy for someone to just throw away all their old material and start fresh. And so the question is what does he do next? And the thing that he does is he sets a goal, which is basically to build up to an hour of material again.

(00:18:34):
But the goal isn't that important. What's important here is the system. So the system that he uses is he writes for an hour every morning, doesn't write for more if he doesn't want to, and then he goes and performs at night. And so when you rinse and repeat that system, do it hundreds of times, that's how he builds up from five minutes to 15 minutes to 30 minutes of material. And so I think that I take a lot of inspiration from that and I think product people can generally, which is instead of being obsessed with the goal, be obsessed with the system that gets you there. And so the phrase I sometimes use is goals with good intentions don't work. I really need to give a common example. A really common example is teams that are trying to learn about customers or do research. And one thing I've observed is a team may have a goal like an OKR of talking to 10 customers this quarter and they may or may not hit that OKR. And then if you watch closely, the next quarter, they may not have a goal of talking to customers anymore. And so their learning is going up and down.

(00:19:49):
And to draw a contrast, that's just really different than a team that has some default on system for talking to customers. Every few times a week they're talking to customers for whatever reason. And the impact of that is really hard to see until you understand that the latter team tends to have really good product instincts or really good customer instincts. It's because they've just had this default on mindset of talking to customers. And in the early days of Coda, we actually did something similar. We had a time allotted on Fridays and it was basically, it was on the calendar a customer or a potential customer was coming in and so you knew that it was going to happen and you had to have something to show. And so sometimes we'd be scrambling the three hours before to have a prototype ready for a customer. Sometimes we would've had something that we've been baking for a while. But the point is that it was default on. And so the way that we developed good customer instincts was not the goal, it was really just the system behind it. So that's one that I'm passionate about and I think it also translates into a lot of the rituals that we talk a lot about.

Lenny (00:21:06):
There's so many directions I can go with this. I really like this one. It reminds me of something I did at Airbnb where we had a lunch with a host every Friday with the team and we had a community person find someone in San Francisco that's a host. And there's no agenda, it's just let's have lunch and meet the team. Curious what you're wondering.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:22):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:21:22):
And Airbnb hosts are always so nice and has such a pleasant experience. Also makes me think about this book, The Score Takes Care of Itself.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:30):
Yep.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Have you read that?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Where it's just do the fundamentals and you'll win?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:34):
Totally.

Lenny (00:21:34):
The other thing it reminds me of is I have this quote hanging in my office here. I Believe it's from the Rick Rubin book. And the quote is, "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable."

Lane Shackleton (00:21:48):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:49):
I feel like you just changed art-

Lane Shackleton (00:21:51):
Yeah. Rick Rubin's amazing.

Lenny (00:21:52):
Oh my god, it's so good. Just every section is this quotable thing I want ... I need to hold onto this thing.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:58):
Yeah. He's got a great thing on listening. I really admire what he says about listening and I think that a lot of PMs could take that lesson, which is-

Lenny (00:22:10):
Yeah. What is that lesson?

Lane Shackleton (00:22:11):
The way he talks about it is essentially you want to listen and absorb every fragment of what that person is saying, including their body language and everything else, and try to turn off the side which is crafting your response or figuring out what you're going to say next or what the problem with their argument is or whatever. It's quite hard to do. Because your default mode is always the next step of the conversation. But I think if you can really challenge yourself, like he says, to pause and really try to internalize holistically what that person's saying, it's pretty powerful.

Lenny (00:22:55):
I was actually just reading that chapter and the next chapter is about this idea of the beginner's mind. I don't know if you remember that. I feel like people get sniped by Rick Rubin stuff. But anyway, I'm going to go down this thread. He talks about how AlphaZero or AlphaGo, the first AI thing that beat humans at Go and how there was this move it made, move 37 in the game that was just like ... The person the AI was playing walked out of the room. He's like, "I don't even know what just happened. This is out of anything I've ever imagined." And it won. And the lesson there it was trained not on what we've learned, but it trained itself and figured things out from first principles and then came up with this thing we've never even comprehended. And so it's a really good example of the power of coming from a beginner's mind and not being influenced by what's already been done.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:41):
Yeah. We have a walkthrough ritual that we do.

Lenny (00:23:45):
Tell me more.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:46):
The prompt is essentially put yourself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about this topic whatsoever and have beginner's mind and then walk through with five or 10 people watching you and let's fix all the problems that we see.

Lenny (00:24:05):
Okay. I want to talk about rituals. We're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Is there any other principles that you can share either just on a high level or in depth that you've come across? And I know people can go to your Substack and read this. And by the way, what's your Substack URL for people that want to check it out?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:21):
Just lane.substack.com.

Lenny (00:24:24):
Sweet. We'll definitely link into it. Yeah. Any other principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:28):
I think the other one is cathedrals, not bricks, and then the other one is proactive, not reactive. Cathedrals, not bricks I think is a classic one. I think I had a moment of realization and talking to Shishir in a one-on-one when I was at YouTube bemoaning the fact that my team wasn't performing to the potential that I thought they had. And he had a very pointed and unexpected question, which is like, "Do they know their cathedral? Do they have a cathedral?" And I'm sitting there like, "Man, what are you talking about? We're talking about performing as a team and you're asking me about cathedrals." And then he explained the cathedral story, which I can talk about. In that-

Lenny (00:25:11):
What's the cathedral story?

Lane Shackleton (00:25:11):
It was quite clarifying.

Lenny (00:25:13):
Yeah. Do share.

Lane Shackleton (00:25:14):
Yeah. The cathedral story is basically you walk up to three people, they're laying bricks. You ask the first person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take the bricks from over here and I put them on that sack over there." You ask the second person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take this little cement and I put it on top of the brick that that person lays." You ask the third person, "What are you doing?" And they say, "Well, we're building a cathedral." And the core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks. And I think it's really, really easy to do when PMs are really busy on a day-to-day to just be one task after the other, really execution oriented and maybe not take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is. And I think we've learned many times that one unexpected bit of this is that everybody needs to see a different facet of the cathedral.

(00:26:22):
So very often ... And I've made this mistake before plenty of times. Very often people will do a great writeup on vision or strategy or whatever it is and the result is people can't quite see their version of what this broader arc is or this broader cathedral is. And so one of the things that we have tried to do when we go through big planning cycles is show all the different sides of this. So instead of just having a writeup, we may have a writeup, we may couple that with a metric, we may couple that with directional mocks and what the billboard might look like or how our homepage may change. And really what we're trying to do is take the mystery out of the set of broader constraints or where we're headed. I think great product teams and great PM leaders tend to always orient their teams towards a broader cathedral as opposed to laying bricks.

Lenny (00:27:26):
Such a beautiful metaphor. Reminds me of this other quote I just looked up while you're chatting. "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

Lane Shackleton (00:27:39):
Classic. Classic. It's Antoine.

Lenny (00:27:42):
That is right. Antoine de St. Exupery. Okay. Something I was curious about as you were chatting also is for folks that want to develop their own principles and define how they want to think about products, is there anything you found to be useful in helping emerge these into principles that you can come to? Is it just sitting around thinking? Is there anything else you've done that has helped you define these things?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:06):
Probably two things. One is reading really broadly. So I think not just reading PM style literature. Like I said, I tend to get a lot of inspiration from outside of tech. I think that's one thing. I think the other thing is insofar as you get the opportunity to mentor other people, think about what you're saying to these people. Think about, okay, this person came to me with this challenge. What was my response? Why was that my response? Am I giving that response a lot of times? Okay, maybe this is a more deeply held belief. So I think noticing those instances was helpful for me.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Are there any books or topics or areas that you found most inspirational when you talk about reading and studying other non-product tech?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:53):
I mean definitely sports. I would say sports is really interesting to me. Team sports. I've always been a huge fan of everything team sports. Storytelling. Go look at some of the best storytellers in the world and they're actually out there on a stage telling stories. There's a book called Storyworthy that I really like.

Lenny (00:29:15):
I was just going to mention that. That book is so good. Somebody mentioned this on the podcast and I read it. It's the most useful practical book for how to tell stories.

Lane Shackleton (00:29:23):
It's so good. The insight is amazing. Just in case your listeners are interested, the insight is basically the nugget of a great story is five seconds of transformation. So if you just orient everything else around that moment of transformation, then you end up usually telling a reasonably good story. I had a conversation with the author right after I read that book because I was just totally enamored with it. And then we ended up bringing him into Coda and he gave a great talk. So yeah, big plug for Matthew Dicks.

Lenny (00:29:58):
The other thing that stuck with me also from that same ... We're just going on all kinds of tangents. From that same insight is, and I watch movies completely differently now, where basically the characters you meet at the beginning of the story, they're going to be completely opposite at the end of the story because of this transformation that takes place. So I'm watching movies with my wife now, I'm like, "Okay, she's very shy right now. She's going to be very extroverted by the end of this movie." Or, "They love each other. Oh, they're going to have a lot of problems." That's so interesting. Oh, that's such a good idea. Okay, I'm going to get this guy on hopefully. And he's a Moth champion basically.

Lane Shackleton (00:30:30):
Yeah. I would say as maybe a principal version of this, the way that you learn or the way that everyone including me learns new things is you go seek out the best at that given craft. So in this case, you go to the Moth StorySLAM you see some really good stories. If you ever watch these on YouTube. And then you just unpack what they're doing and how they're doing it. And then obviously I think the other way to learn quickly is to throw yourself in the deep end. So insofar as you can put yourself in situations that are uncomfortable or force you to do things like tell a story or force you to come up with a clear strategy, you should always opt into those, especially early in your career.

Lenny (00:31:18):
The first thing you said, that's basically the whole premise of this podcast. Find the best at all these things and learn from them, extract and share.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:24):
And the world is much better for it. This podcast is an amazing resource.

Lenny (00:31:29):
Thanks man.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:29):
You've done something very special.

Lenny (00:31:31):
I appreciate it. This podcast episode is already very special. The point you just made reminds me of something that I heard you talk about, which is this oh shit moment. I don't know if it's related to what you shared of just giving people a sense of whether they're making progress in their career. Can you talk about that?

Lane Shackleton (00:31:49):
Sure. Yeah. I think I picked this up originally from Seth Godin, the author, and it just totally stuck with me. The basic thesis is that moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit, I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. And so I have found that they turn out to be a pretty good way to calibrate whether someone is growing in their career. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous in my opinion way to ask this question. And a much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:33:04):
That is so good. Making me think about this podcast where I never wanted to do podcasts. I'm like I'm not a podcast person. I just want to sit there and type out newsletters. How cool is that? And I'm like, no, I got to do it because it's hard. And I'm glad I did it. It also reminds me of this quote that I love that I always think back to. "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek."

Lane Shackleton (00:33:26):
Nice. That reminds me of ... Have you read the book The Obstacle is the Way?

Lenny (00:33:31):
No. Say More.

Lane Shackleton (00:33:33):
It's a great book by Ryan Holiday. And the core thesis is ... It's a bit about stoicism. But the core idea is essentially instead of running away from obstacles, you should be running toward them and that's where you experience either the most growth or the most profound moments of your life. He gives a lot of examples in that book of people throughout history who made that choice. And I think he's also given that talk to hundreds of sports teams. It's a good book. Worth reading.

Lenny (00:34:08):
It's so hard. It's so hard to do hard things, man. So we've been talking about principles of great product managers. You also spent a lot of time looking at the rituals of great product teams. And I know you're working on this handbook that I'm excited to learn more about. Can you just talk about ... I guess one, where this idea came from of studying rituals of great teams and also just how do you actually go about learning about these rituals? I know you have this really interesting process.

Lane Shackleton (00:34:31):
Yeah. In general, I'm a big believer in good design and good product starts with noticing. Tony Fadell has a great talk on this. So I think a bunch of us that are really obsessed with rituals, we just honestly try to be great at noticing. So see something happening with a customer, ask a few questions, get introduced to their team, hear about something interesting from a non-customer, ask for an intro, end up just probing and asking a lot of questions. And then in many cases nowadays with Coda, we're building new rituals alongside people. So someone has a creative idea about how to implement something and we're like partners or collaborators with them on that, which is honestly incredibly fun to just see people's creativity expressed in a tool and then by extension the social construct that they exist in. So that's a little bit about how we got started in that whole process. And then of course Shishir is writing a book called Rituals of Great Teams so we've been cataloging those. We've been hosting a bunch of rituals dinners where we basically get people together for a dinner and we usually have three or four presenters at those dinners. It's just a great chance to learn and think about how the engine runs in a lot of these companies.

Lenny (00:36:03):
What are some rituals that you've learned from these dinners and these and this research you've done that have really stuck with you?

Lane Shackleton (00:36:10):
There are so many. It's hard to choose. Maybe I'll choose two that are top of mind. One is Dharmesh Shah has this ritual from HubSpot called flash tags. Have you heard of this?

Lenny (00:36:24):
No.

Lane Shackleton (00:36:27):
We've all probably been in the situation where someone gives you feedback and you either under interpret it or over interpret it. And as an organization, I think the core principle here is like you want to be calibrated on how much to pay attention to a bit of feedback. And so he outlines four flash tags. He presented this in one of our dinners. And I absolutely love the phrasing of these as someone who's given a lot of feedback on product stuff in their career. So it ranges from ... I think it's FYI, suggestion, recommendation, plea. So FYI is basically like I had a thought, take it or leave it kind of thing. Suggestion is ... And he uses this hill dying metaphor. So is this a hill I'm going to die on? And FYI is there's no hill in sight. Suggestion is there's a hill. I'm not going to die on it but this is what I would do if I were you. You can take it or leave it. Recommendation is I'm climbing the hill. I'm not going to die here, but I've thought about this a lot, so don't ignore this.

(00:37:41):
And then the fourth one, plea, is hopefully rarely used in the organization. It's like, I don't like dying on hills. That's not what we do here. But this is a pretty good candidate for it. You should really trust me. And so we have ended up using that. I was actually just at an offsite and someone gave a lightning talk to our team on how valuable this has been just to calibrate, hey, we got 100 pieces of feedback and there's one plea. Okay, let's spend our time on that. Or there's a whole bunch of FYIs. I think we're fine. Let's keep going. No worries.

Lenny (00:38:20):
That's amazing. It's interesting none of them are just do it this way. I imagine that's very intentional.

Lane Shackleton (00:38:25):
Yeah. Honestly it's a sign of ... In Dharmesh's case, I don't know him super well, but it's a sign of a really experienced leader to know that scale. But every time I look at the scale and I'm weighing where I am between suggestion or recommendation, I have to giggle to myself.

Lenny (00:38:45):
And how do you actually use it? In the feedback you put a hashtag plea kind of thing?

Lane Shackleton (00:38:51):
The way gets used in code docs and the way I think other companies have made it a ritual is you'll have a feedback table and you'll write your feedback and then there'll just be a little select list and you can select between those four. And usually what people do is they include the description so you can as you're choosing it, think do I really feel that strongly about this? And honestly, it's good hygiene. Otherwise, every bit of feedback is taken the same. Which just fundamentally the impact of that is it slows everything down because now you're looking at a list of 100 pieces of feedback and you're going like, "Oh man, we got to address all this feedback." Whereas as soon as you distinguish between what's most important, it's much easier to sort through that.

Lenny (00:39:46):
What about if it's in person? Do you say this is a plea or this is a FYI?

Lane Shackleton (00:39:50):
Oh, I've definitely heard that in many meetings. Are you making a recommendation or are you making a plea?

Lenny (00:39:57):
Amazing.

Lane Shackleton (00:39:58):
And making the person think through that choice I think is just a very helpful shared language.

Lenny (00:40:04):
I imagine one of the other benefits of this is I think most leaders that rise up the ranks eventually realize anything they say in a meeting is going to be taken really seriously and the team's going to rush back and be like, "Oh, Lane told us to change this thing." I imagine it helps you just make it clear. No, you don't need to actually change this. It's just my thoughts.

Lane Shackleton (00:40:21):
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:22):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company. I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous, but they did find some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month. Probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.

(00:41:21):
According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early, and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny at E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.

(00:42:15):
Any other rituals that stand out as really interesting, either more recently you've learned or something you're just like, oh, wow, that was a genius?

Lane Shackleton (00:42:21):
I guess one that I get asked about a lot on our team is called Catalyst. And I guess maybe to set some context on this one, in most product teams, the review forum is just a really important part of the product development process. And the core insight for most review forums or product reviews or decision forums is that they generally suffer from two problems that are hard to spot unless you've sat through hundreds of them. The first is they have standing attendees, and the second is they're normally single-threaded, meaning they're normally one topic at a time. So maybe I'll talk about both of those because I think they're not exactly intuitive. So when you think about what happens with a standing set of attendees, you either have the situation where you have too many people in the meeting or you have not enough people in the meeting, and both of those can cause problems.

(00:43:25):
So if you've ever been in a meeting, I certainly have, where it's like, "Hey, do we have the salesperson who knows most about this or do we have the engineer who's actually implementing this here? Oh, great. They're not here? They're not a part of the standing set of attendees?" You either have to reschedule the meeting or worse, you just do the discussion without the person who's most knowledgeable, which seems crazy in retrospect. The second problem is single-threaded. So one topic at a time. So if you think about if a product development process is somewhat of a chaotic assembly line for a second, your review or your decision forum ends up being a big time bottleneck in many cases. And obviously you want to be in a situation where product people have a lot of autonomy and they can make most of the decisions themselves. And I'm a big believer in decentralized leadership and all of that, but there are things that cut across the company that need to get reviewed by a broader set of stakeholders.

(00:44:29):
And so what happens when those things are single threaded is either the meeting is really long, so it's a three-hour review meeting once a week, and by the end everyone is about to fall asleep, or it's really short and it's really hard to get on the calendar. You're like, "Oh, can we get on the calendar in two weeks?" And the downside of the not being able to get on the calendar is that now you've just slowed down the whole velocity of the company because the throughput of your review meeting is really slow. So we built Catalyst to really solve those two problems. And so the way it works is it's essentially three one hour blocks throughout the week, and the assumption is that the whole company is free. So you can get anyone in the company for those three hours. And each topic has essentially four roles. Driver, maker, braintrust, and interested. It's a very transparent system.

(00:45:28):
So a salesperson can say, "Oh, I'm interested in this product development review. I'm just going to mark myself as interested." And then the driver is the person who's actually going to drive the meeting, drive the decision, drive the outcome, things like that. And basically, this is all centralized in one doc. And what happens is the day before, that hold that's on calendar gets removed, and then you have specific topics that get added. So there may be three topics going all at the same time because they don't have overlapping attendees. And the impact of this, I think if you really watch it in progress is huge. You basically have many topics running all at the same time, so the throughput is much better and you have the right attendees every single time, and you have a clear set of drivers and roles in these meetings. So that means that we can review work much, much faster with the right people, and ideally that results in more value to our customers, more things getting shipped, just a higher velocity organization. So that's one that we get asked about a lot. And actually a couple of weeks ago, we spent a while remaking the template for that one.

Lenny (00:46:45):
I love that ritual. You actually wrote even in more depth in the post that we worked together on how Coda builds product, which we'll link to if folks want to try this out and you link to actual templates people can actually use it their companies. When someone's listening to this and they're like, "Oh, wow, this is extremely cool," how easy is it do you find for people to take a ritual from a company and implement it? How much is cultural and it's hard to transplant, or do you find people can take this Catalyst idea plug and play at a lot of companies?

Lane Shackleton (00:47:15):
Yeah. I think it depends a lot on what your role in the company is. Maybe to say the extremes for a second, if you're a brand new PM to an organization, you probably shouldn't go try to remake the whole product review cycle that the head of product is really passionate about and has crafted. But you can probably take a decision template or some interesting ritual that has facilitated a team in the past and use it with your team. Another one of my favorites there is a hundred dollar voting. We use that a lot in the context of planning, and I find that creative rituals like that are easy to pick up for teams because oftentimes it's like, okay ... And maybe I'll describe the ritual real quick.

Lenny (00:48:01):
Yeah. I was going to ask.

Lane Shackleton (00:48:02):
The ritual is essentially you can take any set of problems or solutions or themes or whatever you want to get people's input on, and you put those into a table and then people can basically vote with their dollars and usually you allocate $100. And so people will go through and say, "Oh, I want to allocate $10 to this and $20 to this and $50 to this because I think it's really important." And I have found that especially in planning processes, little rituals like this are great at getting the elephant in the room out. So it's like, "Oh wow, we have a huge spread on this one particular problem. You think it's a huge problem. I don't think it's a problem at all. Let's talk about it." Going back to the thesis of turning ambiguity into clarity, a lot of this is like we're trying to get the ambiguous stuff out there so that we can make it more clear.

(00:49:03):
And so I use that as an example because you can be a brand new PM, run a brainstorm, run a planning session like that, and you're probably going to get great feedback. People are probably going to go, "This is cool. I've never done this before." Now to go to the other side of the spectrum, we help a lot of companies that want to remake a whole process. They want to remake a review system like Catalyst or they want to remake their decision rituals. And so in that sense, we're usually talking to a head of product or director of product or VP of product and someone who tends to have a lot more agency over the way that the team works.

Lenny (00:49:48):
Coda is interesting in that it feels like you have pretty stable processes for planning and reviews. I find most companies just every six months rethink a lot of these things. I guess that's probably a sign that you found something that's really good and works and you don't have to redo it. How much are you radically changing the way you operate versus working in similar ways? How do you think about that percentage wise?

Lane Shackleton (00:50:11):
People are always coming up with new creative ways to make their teams run better, make decisions go smoother. And we're continuously adopting those, but there's definitely a backbone of the system. The backbone of the system is Catalyst and tag-ups and the concept called Bullpen. And then there'll be a lot of iteration on top of that. And even those systems went through a lot of iteration. I talked about how the calendar hold got removed and then individual topics got added. That took us launching automations and the ability to add things to calendar in order for that whole process to really work. So in the years prior to us launching that, we did it very manually. So I think there's still a lot of creativity that I see every day.

(00:51:06):
So I'll give one quick example. One of our PM leads on core product, this guy Nathan, he basically saw that a lot of decisions had a lot of different stakeholders because he's in the core product. And now he's leading the core product team so he's trying to figure out what guidance do I give to each of these PMs on who to involve in these decisions? Because every one of these with core product feels like they impact everybody. And so a very simple thing that he did probably in the last six months was he had a table of all the upcoming decisions and then at a tag-up ... Which I can explain if you want. But basically with a small set of stakeholders, he had all the upcoming decisions and then he let people hit a little reaction and say, "Oh, I don't need to be involved. Just notify me of the decision after." Or, "Hey, I have some opinions, but you can keep going." Or, "No, I really want to be heavily involved in this decision."

(00:52:10):
And it was such a pro move. It was such a, I've been through a million of these. I don't want to treat every one of them the same because if I do, it's going to slow down the velocity of this whole organization. And so instead, the majority of those, Shishir or I or Oliver, the head of engineering will say, "I may have some opinions, but keep going." That's often the default. And then there are plenty where we say, "Just notify us of the decision after." And in doing that, Nathan can now give better guidance to the PMs on his team and say, "Hey, you don't really need to involve as wide a group as you think, so just keep going and check in later." So I think those types of little iterations are usually based on a really good insight.

Lenny (00:53:02):
It sounds like a dream come true for a platform team to reduce how many people have to be involved in all your planning and decision making. And that process in which you call it tag-up, maybe just briefly explain it and then I want to talk about this handbook you're working on, which is going to I think, cover a lot of these things.

Lane Shackleton (00:53:17):
Tag-up is based on this insight that a lot of work and project work tends to get discussed in one-on-ones. And actually it's really an anti-pattern. It's a pattern you should try to avoid. So if you're talking to your manager about product work, what's not happening in that moment is your eng lead and your design lead, they're not hearing that. And so you end up with this big game of telephone where you'll have a conversation with your manager in a one-on-one, they'll go back and translate to their engineering and design lead, and of course the fidelity of the game of telephone, something is lost in all of those transmissions. And so the core idea is have a group one-on-one with the key stakeholders. And so we have this concept of braintrust that's modeled off after Pixar's braintrust.

(00:54:11):
And so we'll have a tag-up with a small set of people from a given team, or sometimes we have larger groups, and then they meet with their braintrust and it's once a week. It's the same mindset of a one-on-one. It's their time. So anything that they need to unblock a decision or to make progress, they should use that time for. And they often start by reviewing OKRs and metrics and things like that. But then we generally get into a table of topics. Anyone can add a topic. Those topics are up voted, so people will react and then the table will sort itself. And then we'll say, "Okay, this is clearly the topic on people's mind." And that's a version of what we call Dory, which I can talk about. But essentially the principle is you should discuss that project work with the whole group there. With the whole triad there. And oftentimes with the sales person there and with the marketer there and with everybody else. So I found that that is just a really good practice to try to move a lot of that work out of one-on-ones and into a small group setting.

Lenny (00:55:26):
Awesome. Okay. So you're working on a handbook that's collecting a lot of these rituals. Talk about that and then when can people maybe look for it?

Lane Shackleton (00:55:36):
One of the realizations I had the other day, probably a month or two ago when we started working on this thing, was I was talking to someone about Catalyst and a couple other concepts, and they were like, "I get it. I'm sold. I want to implement some of these things. Where do I look?" And so I found myself sending them a bunch of links to individual templates. So that cued us into the fact that we needed to have a better core handbook for teams that wanted to adopt some of these rituals and also learn from all the rituals that we have learned from and feel very fortunate to have partnered with so many customers on. And so what we did was started writing this handbook, and it's going to come out hopefully by the time this recording is done. And in it, we'll talk about everything from rituals like Catalyst to decision rituals to a lot of planning and strategy and roadmaps, that kind of stuff. And trying to pull out the most interesting patterns and also give people a pretty practical view of how to implement these things. I think that's what has been lacking sometimes.

Lenny (00:56:50):
Amazing. We'll definitely link to that. Hopefully it's live by the time goes out. We'll make it happen. I know also you said Shishir's working on a book that's related and basically rituals of great teams and Shishir was on the podcast and he talked about Dory, so we don't have to get into that. If people want to learn about Dory, they can watch that episode. It was one of the earliest episodes actually. One of the most popular.

Lane Shackleton (00:57:09):
Yeah. I remember that.

Lenny (00:57:11):
Okay. Cool. I have a bunch of random questions now. I'm just going to go in a few different directions. One is, you wrote this post that you call Learn by Making, Not Talking. Is that another principle by the way? Is that amongst your many principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:11):
Yes.

Lenny (00:57:24):
Okay. Awesome. So in that post, which we'll link to, you share this story of how you and the YouTube team came up with skippable ads, which I didn't realize it was such a controversial ... But in thinking about it, obviously letting people skip ads, I could see why people were not excited about that. Could you just tell that story? And basically it's like the story of how skippable ads on YouTube came about?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:46):
Yeah. So I moved over to YouTube shortly after the acquisition. It was an amazing tight-knit team. It definitely felt like the Wild West. We were getting sued by Viacom for a billion dollars when that was a lot of money. No advertiser wanted to talk to us. It was essentially viewed as a site of cat videos and dogs on skateboards and things like that. And then I guess the other context, the sales team was very nascent and all they wanted to sell was the homepage and for good reason. That was where you made your money as a salesperson. And so I had just been sponsored by Salar and Shishir to become a PM. It's a longer story that I'll leave out for now and we can go into. But on day one of being a PM, Shishir's like, "Great. You're the new guy. You get the project that nobody else wants and that's called skippable ads. And we've got this crazy idea that we can align the incentives of advertisers and viewers and creatives in this really clever way by putting a skip button on the ad and then charging people per views." And the latter part we hadn't quite cemented yet, but it was part of the core idea.

(00:59:04):
And so the thing I write about in this post is as a new PM, this feels like a really consequential decision. It's like we've got this new product idea. Nobody really wants it. Advertisers don't want it. The sales team doesn't want it. And it's a very unproven thesis. And so the thing I write about is these are the types of things that you can debate for months or years. And I was sitting in a one-on-one with this guy named Phil Farhi who's an amazing product leader and was my boss at the time. And we're trying to figure out what to do and how to handle all the different dynamics. And he just stops and he's like, "You know what? Just test the extremes. Start the experiment tomorrow. We'll figure it out." Essentially.

(00:59:49):
And I think his point was like, look, we can debate this forever. So I would rather us see the upper and lower bounds of how good this could be or how bad this is going to be immediately. And so we launched a set of experiments. This guy Jamie Kerns who's still there. Tiny little skip button on one experiment, giant skip button that covered the entire player on the other side of the experiment. And within a few weeks, I think we had developed some conviction based on some very directional data that we were onto something. And so the lesson that I took, this is many years ago and I've seen this proven out hundreds of times since, is stop talking about it and go make something. Go run an experiment. Go make a prototype, go write a doc, go make a mock. Just don't talk about it.

(01:00:49):
And I found that also as a leader, people really follow that concept. And I also found that it transcends level. I am not talking just to ICPMs. I'm talking to heads of product and CPOs and CEOs to some degree. You should always be out there trying to learn by expressing your ideas and putting them out there. And that's much more valuable in many cases than pontificating about it or having endless circular discussions on it.

Lenny (01:01:23):
It makes me think a little bit about Twitter where they spent years just thinking about the edit button or all these different changes. They're so scared, they did so much research and then now they're changing things left and right. Everything's fine. Everyone's still using it. It shows you that you don't have to be so delicate.

Lane Shackleton (01:01:39):
Yes. It's almost never as bad as you think it's going to be. So yeah, it's just a question of how much better it can be oftentimes.

Lenny (01:01:46):
You mentioned in your early career ... We talked about your Alaska guide phase. Something else I saw is that you were on the AdWords approval team. You basically were reviewing ads people submitted to run on AdWords and that's how you started in tech. So I guess first of all, is that true? And then second of all, how did you graduate from that phase and become this Chief Product Officer of one of the fastest growing, most interesting companies in the world?

Lane Shackleton (01:02:13):
That was a really memorable time. There's an amazing cohort of people that started in tech. I think there was 200 or 300 of us at that time and then eventually thousands that started in Sheryl Sandberg's organization. I guess maybe some quick context. Before running ads on google.com at that time, you had to have them manually approved by a human before that was handled by machine learning and outsourced to other countries. And so there was this process where basically an ad would show up on your screen, you would mark it family safe, non-family safe, porn. And then based on that, it would either run or it wouldn't. And actually, funny enough, some of my most successful friends were terrible at the approval event. They failed the rote task of approving ads. They just couldn't handle it and they went on to be really, really successful.

(01:03:08):
So after working on ad approvals, at that time, I moved to chat support. It was basically when AdWords was launching chat support. I remember very fondly having two chats, chatting with two advertisers at once. Moved on to phone support. That was eight hours a day of talking to AdWords customers. Really a total rollercoaster ride. It was basically one minute you would pick up the phone and it would be someone from a Fortune 100 company trying to spend millions of dollars on AdWords and then the next minute you would be on the phone with a psychic or a taxi driver that was warring with their compatriots over some really specific keyword. I think there were two lessons that I would draw from this. One is I had a mentor at the time and his advice when I was starting my career was basically you have to get customer facing from the very beginning because you're going to end up serving a customer your whole career. Even when you're the CEO of a company, you're going to be serving a customer. So you better get really good at being in any customer scenario and being able to handle it. And so I think that that turned out to be insanely good advice. And if I think about a piece of advice that I give out to people who are early in their career, I've definitely recycled that advice.

(01:04:29):
I think the other thing that I took away from that experience was it's just a great lesson in when people don't actually care about your product. So in AdWord's case, people did not care about AdWords. You were the expert on it and you're trying to tell them about ad groups and how this ad format works and blah, blah. And most of the time people are like, "Dude, I'm a small business owner. I'm trying to get people to come to my auto mechanic store." Or, "I'm trying to get people to come to my taxi service," or whatever it was. I don't care. Basically the product had to get out of the way and really just drive impact for the customer. It was like they just want more phone calls or they want more people in the store. So those are I think two pieces that I think about from those days still.

(01:05:21):
And then I worked in a variety of other roles. I worked in a role called product specialist, which is an awesome role back when there were 15 product specialists at Google. For me, that was an amazing time because I was getting to sit on seven or eight different core product teams. And in my observation, these days, most PMs don't get to sit on other people's core teams. And so I had these three or four years of just ... I call it a masterclass in PMing because I was getting to watch what was working for some PMs and what wasn't working for other PMs and just taking notes behind the scenes. So that was a really influential role. And then went on to various PM roles at Google and YouTube.

Lenny (01:06:09):
Coming back to noticing. It comes up again and again in our chat. This is so interesting because it feels like you basically came from the mail room of tech to the top of the product field. And so I think there's a lot of inspiration people can take from this journey. One quick question is how long was that journey from not being a PM, from I guess being at a tech company to getting your first PM role? Just to give people a sense.

Lane Shackleton (01:06:33):
Let's see. I probably worked for at least four, five years before being able to move to PM and I think that was a slightly harrowing journey because at the time, you had to have a computer science degree.

Lenny (01:06:46):
At Google. Right. Cool. So I think that's one takeaway too is give it time. It's not going to happen. There's a lot of people that are just like, "I need to become a PM immediately."

Lane Shackleton (01:06:55):
Totally.

Lenny (01:06:56):
I think that's a good example of it's not going to happen overnight. Coming back to your two lessons, I think they're really interesting and I'm curious if there's anything else that comes to mind of what you found was essential to you succeeding in this path? So the first lesson you shared as being customer facing. And in this case being in retail as customer facing, is your advice get in a tech company and work on something customers use or is even working at Starbucks or Abercrombie, does that count?

Lane Shackleton (01:07:24):
Yeah. I think maybe to relate it to what you just said, if I were to give advice to someone who really aspires to be a PM or trying to get into PM, I think in many cases if you're in a customer facing role, you are the expert on the customer and that is really, really valuable in tech organizations. And oftentimes it's undervalued. And so I think people who want to move into PM roles who are not currently in PM roles can often lever that experience and that knowledge of the customer in ways that are pretty profound for the organization and pretty insightful for the organization if they really are creative about it. And then I think the other thing is, regardless of where you are in the organization, you're always serving a customer. You can't just talk to one big enterprise customer and you can't just talk to the smallest customer. You have to have a diverse and continuous stream of customer interactions in order to have good intuitions about what to do next. And your engineers aren't going to really trust you unless you have good intuitions about where the customer's headed and what they want and stuff like that. And so the stakes I think are pretty high. The good news is it's easier than ever with all these tools to really get into the mindset of a customer.

Lenny (01:08:47):
My lesson touches on something a previous guest talked about, Paige Costello, where she was often the youngest person in the room and built a lot of respect and people really trusted her over time. And her lesson was know thy customer. If you know the most about what they need, and you can show, here's what I've heard again and again and again, people will just like, "Oh Lane, tell us more." And they bring you into conversation because providing value, you're not just there sharing opinions. Everyone's got opinions.

Lane Shackleton (01:09:15):
That's basically how both me and ... I had a friend named Bill Ferrell who transitioned into PM at the same time and that's essentially how we got the try at being a PM inside of Google was we knew the customer really, really well and we were often in conversations bridging the gap from here's what I think they're really saying, or here's what I think we should build based on what they said.

Lenny (01:09:41):
The other thing I wanted to mention, you talked about the product and how a lot of customers don't care about the product, they just care about just I need this thing done. It reminds me at Airbnb, we hired this guy, Chip Connolly, who was a hotelier. He created the Joie de Vivre hotel chain and just is steeped in hospitality. And he came to Airbnb and started doing this worldwide tour talking to hosts. And he's just like, "Guys, when you talk about product, you're telling hosts, 'Hey, the product's going to be updated. We're going to launch all these features.', they think their home is the product of Airbnb. They don't understand what you're talking about when you're talking about the online experience and the website. That's the last thing they think about. It's the experience of someone traveling on Airbnb and staying in their home." So I think it's a really good reminder of most people don't care about the product. They just have this problem and you just happen to be this website that'll help them solve it.

Lane Shackleton (01:10:30):
I think most people can be way more concise with their communication. Even internally, people don't care. You should assume that people don't care. Or if you're talking to customers, writing a blog post for customers, you should assume that they don't care. When you start with that assumption, you really force yourself to be a little bit sharper in your communication style.

Lenny (01:10:53):
And one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I heard a story that at Coda there's this moment called Tim Ferriss Day that drove a lot of traffic. Can you share that story? Does that ring a bell?

Lane Shackleton (01:11:08):
Yeah. There's lots of memorable days at Coda. One of them was Tim Ferris Day. So I guess maybe for context, we had built this very nascent publisher motion where we were going out and helping people publish their rituals. And this is what you see in the Coda Gallery and a lot of what we talked about today. But we had this one person on that team, this guy Al Chen, Tim Ferriss fan, and also I think had been really tenacious with the people around Tim Ferriss and basically finally got an in to him and figured out a really neat way to implement one of his rituals and wrote a doc. And so none of us really knew this, but this was all happening. And anyway, we wake up one morning and traffic is just spiking through the roof, signups are spiking, no one knows what's going on.

(01:11:59):
I'm convinced this is all spam. I'm like, "Something's wrong with our data or something's going haywire." At the time, we were also in the China Basin office and the fire alarm went off. And so now we're outside on our laptops. We were in a war room trying to figure out what was happening and now we're outside trying to figure out what's going on. So anyway, make a long story short, data scientists investigate and we eventually figured out that we had been featured in Tim Ferriss' email newsletter and I think early on you hear this lesson or this adage of first time founder, build a great product, second time founder, build a great distribution. I think that was one of those early big cues to think about the importance of content distribution and the importance of these publishing flywheels. And it definitely made us double down. We're like, "Okay, if we can do this with Tim Ferriss, what's next?" And we definitely spent a few months trying to reach that high watermark that was set that day in traffic and sign-ups. So it was a fun memorable day and people for the subsequent one or two years would refer to it as Tim Ferriss Day.

Lenny (01:13:15):
So funny. I bet Tim Ferriss had no idea what he did.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:18):
No idea.

Lenny (01:13:19):
Hoping you have a Lenny's podcast day once this comes out. Everyone's going to be freaking out. What is going on here? Is there anything else you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lane Shackleton (01:13:30):
Maybe we're talking really briefly about two-way writeups.

Lenny (01:13:33):
Yeah, let's do it. I had that in my notes, but I skipped it, so I'm glad you mentioned it.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:37):
Cool. Yeah, I mean this is a concept that I wrote a bunch about and I often now get asked about, and I guess maybe the historical view of this, I got really obsessed with the history of how work gets discussed and decided upon and broke it down into three phases. And so the first phase was 1980s we had PowerPoint. It was this amazing tool. You could manipulate shapes on a screen and we were all using fancy clip art and it was really fun, but we've all had the experience of being in a really long PowerPoint presentation and someone's droning on in their slides and stuff like that. Second phase is in the early 2000s, two things converged. One was Google bought this company called Rightly that became Google Docs. So instead of having Word on your desktop and sending files around you now had online collaborative editing.

(01:14:35):
And the other thing was Jeff Bezos sent this very famous memo, which basically said no more PowerPoint at Amazon. And what that did was started in earnest their six pager ritual. You can read all about this in the book Working Backwards. It's a really good book. Colin Breyer's book. And so that started I think what I'll call the one-way writeup phase, which is you're writing down your ideas, you're expressing them clearly. It's in prose so you have to be really clear. That was a big step up I think from always presenting work and deciding on work via presentations. And then the thesis is that we're in the midst of a new phase, which is essentially two-way writeups and that's where it's more conversational and feedback and discussion is actually part of the content itself. So that's the broader historical arc. But if you think about it, PMs and product people are always at the brunt.

(01:15:31):
They feel this the most because they're the ones that are driving decisions and really the ones that are driving discussions oftentimes in companies. And so I think the problem with one-way writeups I felt very deeply at Google and YouTube. And just to name them, the first one is you would always be trying to figure out who's read your write-up. So I have many memories of sending a write-up out at 11:30 PM and then waiting patiently for the avatar of the SVP in my area to show up in there. And that was a sign that they had read it, which is just totally insane if you think about that behavior. The second one is you end up having a lot of the discussion in the comments itself. So this is a space that's really built for grammar and spell checking and things like that. And you're having these really meaningful discussions in this a hundred pixel right margin.

(01:16:30):
And part of that I think is there are all these questions that are being raised, and so you have really no idea what the most important question is. And so if you're facilitating those discussions in one way writeups, you're often going through the comments in the 20 minutes before that session trying to figure out which one of these do I want to address. And then the other behavior, and I don't know if you've ever seen this in a doc, but in one way writeups that you see a lot is there'll be just a mega comment thread on the title of the doc. And people are like, "I don't think we should do this," or you'll get into this 30 comment thread on the title because that's the best place to put your overall thoughts. And I saw this pattern all the time. So if you live that life, I think the world of two-way writeups and the way that I think a lot of our customers are doing it, and you can do this on other tools besides Coda too, I think is quite a bit better.

(01:17:26):
I guess the alternative to go down that list is you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup. So now you can say, oh, these are all the people that have read this. And I think even you see a pattern in some of our customers where if it's a particularly long writeup, you'll have three done reading buttons so you can see where everyone has gotten to. And then the second thing is making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question. So instead of pulling questions out of the comments and trying to figure out which one to address, just putting those in a table and then letting people upload those. And that's what we call Dory. And then I think probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?

(01:18:13):
And if you think about the contrast between a comment thread on the title and seeing a list of all the sentiment, how everybody feels about this proposal and really being inclusive to the entire audience is just wildly different. I think in my particular experience. I'll give you one example. I wrote this proposal, this is now a couple years ago. I thought it was going to sail through no problem. I thought it was going to get four out of five and five out of five smiley faces from everybody. That's sort of how the sentiment table works. And one of the lead designers basically said, "One smiley face. We shouldn't do this." And I was like, oh man. This particular person's not really vocal in meetings. And so I would not have heard that feedback. It was very unlikely I would've heard that feedback unless they had had a sentiment table, a place to add that. And so I think the punchline on all of this is I really authentically believe that this is where we're headed and hope that a lot of PMs and product teams adopt this in general.

Lenny (01:19:23):
I'm so glad that we touched on it and there's a template or an explanation of this that you wrote up that we'll link to. Yeah.

Lane Shackleton (01:19:31):
Great. Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:32):
Awesome. Is there anything else that you think that we should touch on that we haven't touched on?

Lane Shackleton (01:19:37):
Yeah. I think one thing that we've discussed before is just about strategy and planning and stuff like that. So it may be useful to touch on a couple of insights there. I think there's two insights in the strategy and planning thing. And this is again in the handbook that we're writing, but the first that I end up seeing a lot is just this idea that OKRs are not actually strategy. So I think the way that we plan and the way that our customers plan, the key point is it's critical to disconnect strategy discussions from OKR discussions. And it sounds really obvious, but it's I think a very common mistake. And I think a really simple question to ask yourself is do we have a separate strategy process or strategy ritual that is distinct from OKR setting and metric setting and goal setting? And I have found you can pick whatever strategy framework works for you, but I do think it's quite important to pull those two things apart.

(01:20:43):
The other rule that we live by on the planning side is what we call a 10% planning rule, which is essentially just ensure that you're not for a given time period planning for more than 10% of that execution period. And I think this is a really easy mistake to make. I mean, this is a hard fought rule because we've made that mistake before. But you end up getting bogged down in planning or saying, planning felt rushed and so we need to make it three weeks instead of one week or whatever. And the byproduct of that over the course of a lot of time is that you end up just planning way too much and oftentimes you really don't know what's ahead until you've launched or learned something. And so I think that's a pretty good rule to follow.

Lenny (01:21:32):
I love that rule. I found the same heuristic. 10%. If you're planning for a week, plan for half a day, planning for a month, maybe like three days. Yeah, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:46):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:21:47):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:51):
One that comes to mind is Turning the Flywheel. It's a little manuscript book. Jim Collins wrote it. It's really, I think a very succinct and very fast read about how flywheels work. We talked about Storyworthy. I recommend that book a lot. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy. Love that book. Very simple framework that I've reused a bunch. Maybe outside of tech, Waking Up is a book by Sam Harris on mindfulness that I really like. And then an old one that I really like is The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galway, which is a kind of classic.

Lenny (01:22:27):
Amazing. On Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, I'm working on getting Richard Rumelt on the podcast. I'm in talks with his agent and they seem to be excited. So we'll hope that actually happens. And then you inspired me to try to get the Storyworthy guy on. So what a cast of characters we're going to get on here.

(01:22:43):
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Lane Shackleton (01:22:48):
Yeah, it's a little bit hard with three kids and a job these days to watch a lot of TV. I would say I really enjoyed The Last Dance. I love any sports documentary. All those.

Lenny (01:22:59):
Have you seen Underrated, Steph Curry's new documentary?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:01):
No, I haven't. I got to watch that.

Lenny (01:23:03):
Ooh. It's really good.

Lane Shackleton (01:23:05):
I've been rewatching Arrested Development. That's also just a timeless classic.

Lenny (01:23:11):
Classic. I love that Michael Cera is in the Barbie movie, not to give any spoilers. That was a funny surprise.

(01:23:18):
Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:22):
There's two I really like. One is teach me something that I don't already know. I think it's just an awesome way of seeing if someone's going to lean in and really figure out what you don't know and then how passionate they are about pitching what they do know I think is really fun. And then Shishir and I have been asking a version of teleporter question and evolving it for many years now, so I like that question quite a bit.

Lenny (01:23:49):
Shishir shared that question in his episode and we make TikTok clips out of some of these conversations and that clip just went crazy. People love it. It's our most viewed clip, I think on TikTok. Or just like, what would your answer to that question, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes if you want to watch just that one interview question. I think you maybe gave it away, so maybe that's why you're evolving it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:10):
Yeah. We-

Lenny (01:24:11):
Don't know if we screwed you.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:13):
I also recently wrote a post about my favorite ref check question, which I think I would love to learn other people's favorite ref check questions.

Lenny (01:24:20):
References check. Oh man. That's its own. Oh man, I'd love to do a podcast just on that. That is such an important skill. The first question you mentioned of asking people to teach you something, I heard the best version of that in a previous episode where Maya, the Head of Product for Spotify podcasts, asks what would your podcast be if you were to start a podcast?

Lane Shackleton (01:24:40):
I like that.

Lenny (01:24:42):
So feel free to steal it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:45):
I sometimes do a version of making them explain it two different ways after, and making the candidate explain it two different ways and saying, "Okay, now you have to explain that to your grandparent." And then now you just told me about sewing or some hobby of yours. Now sell it in its most technical form to someone who knows everything about this particular topic. And so it's kind of fun to also see the range that people can operate.

Lenny (01:25:13):
Awesome. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? Either digital or physical, anything that comes to mind?

Lane Shackleton (01:25:21):
A few. I'm becoming a real sleep nerd, so those eye masks that cup around your eyes, I love. Obviously in the tech world, ChatGPT. I got really obsessed with tennis during the pandemic. There's a product called Swing Vision that's really good. It basically cuts up your match into different ... All of your forehands or all the longest rallies or all that and uses AI to do that. There's a corresponding meditation app to the book Waking Up that I really like. That one's a very good one.

Lenny (01:25:57):
We live not so far from each other, so we got to play some tennis and I could check out this very cool product.

Lane Shackleton (01:26:01):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (01:26:03):
You're on. That'll be our sequel. Just our game. Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with people around you, share with your kids maybe?

Lane Shackleton (01:26:16):
I don't know if it's as motto as much as it's just a way of being. It's essentially the present moment is all that we have. Realizing that our attention is very often on the past or the future and in so many ways the present is where it should be always. And so I think that that is something I think about a lot. I think maybe more broadly, I had a mentor who roughly said a version of make things happen, and so I really try to apply that to anything that I do. If that's work or life or sports, I try to be the person who creates momentum and positive change and progress. And so I think that that's generally a good motto to live by.

Lenny (01:26:58):
Beautiful. What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:03):
My mom's a psychologist and a professional counselor so certainly active listening. Maybe the tech version of that or the modern version of that is steal manning someone's argument, being able to repeat back to someone what they said in a better form, more clear form. So yeah, she's an amazing woman. Taught me a lot about listening.

Lenny (01:27:28):
Final question. You were a guide in Alaska helping people climb. If someone were to pursue climbing, is there a tip or a lesson or something that you think people should know to get better at this or to know before they go down this route?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:43):
There's a saying, which is the safest climber is the one who knows when to come down essentially. And I think that there are many times that you have to put your ego in check and come off a mountain or come out of a climb because it's not quite as safe as you thought it was. So I think that's maybe one. I think the other is it's probably not a one-way door. So I think in many ways you can do climbing and you can do some of these outdoor pursuits on the side, or you can always come back from them. So it's maybe not as big of a choice as some people think it is.

Lenny (01:28:24):
Lane, I said at the top of this episode, Coda has one of the most thoughtful product teams out there, and I think it'll be clear to people after listening to this why that's the case and where it trickles down from. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and ask you any other questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lane Shackleton (01:28:42):
I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have a Substack. We'll be releasing that handbook for product teams that I will probably post on Substack. And in terms of useful to me, yeah, give Coda a try. Give us feedback. I love hearing from product people all over. It's one of the bright spots in my day to hear all the creative rituals that come from this community. You've created just a legendary community of people and so they always give very thoughtful feedback so I'm very open to all of that. And yeah, thanks for having me.

# Career frameworks, A/B testing, onboarding tips, selling to engineers |  Laura Schaffer (Amplitude)

## Transcript

Laura Schaffer (00:00:00):
... Like the dead of the night. And by that, I mean 7:00 PM or something on. I'm pretty sure it was a Friday. We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the silent flow and ran as Navy test with a small group. And I'm fully expecting, "Okay, this is going to hurt our numbers, but maybe it won't be so bad and I'm going to be prepared to advocate the power of this data that we're getting." And I was totally geared up thinking about written, started to write the framework for how I wanted to surface this. And we start to get the data for this thing. I'm not kidding, an improved conversion. There's no personalization, nothing past it, just the questions. An improved conversion by like 5%, just improved signups. And it was one of those like, "What? Okay, what is going on here?"

Lenny (00:00:50):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Laura Schaffer. The week we recorded this chat turned out to be Laura's first week in a new gig as head of growth for Amplitude taking over for a previous legendary guest, Elena Verna. Prior to Amplitude, Laura was VP of product and growth at a company called Rapid. Before that, she spent over seven years at Twilio as Head of Growth and PM lead of the growth platform and experimentation platform at Twilio. In our conversation, we dig into Laura's career growth framework and the importance of carving your own path versus waiting for one to be carved for you. We also get into a bunch of tactical and surprising advice around running experiments, making decisions on gut versus data, developing your growth strategy and how to sell your product to developers. Laura has a wealth of wisdom and I learned a lot from our conversation. With that, I bring you Laura Schaffer after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account, while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high. But buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash and the US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account. You can access your cash whenever you want, even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days. Just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8% a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury count at public.com/lenny.

(00:03:02):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools. We're trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue You discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. An Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end e-mail marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.

(00:04:15):
Laura, welcome to the podcast.

Laura Schaffer (00:04:18):
Thanks, Lenny, it is so great to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:21):
It's great to have you. So I asked Elena Elena, Elena, I'm not even sure how to pronounce her name, maybe. What is it?

Laura Schaffer (00:04:21):
Elena. You got it.

Lenny (00:04:27):
Elena. Okay. Okay. I think I've said it wrong all the time. All this time. Okay, Elena. So I asked Elena Ferna, who's a popular guest on this podcast who I should have on this podcast and you are the first person that immediately came to mind. And so I'm really excited that we're doing this and that you agreed to be on.

Laura Schaffer (00:04:42):
Well, she's the best and I'm really happy that she referred me because I'm just stoked to be here. So thanks for listening to her guidance.

Lenny (00:04:50):
Absolutely. And it's a cool time to be chatting. You're the newly minted head of growth at Amplitude and so congrats, first of all.

Laura Schaffer (00:04:57):
Thank you. Appreciate that. Yeah, this is my day two and a half here. So very [inaudible 00:05:04].

Lenny (00:05:06):
Wow, you're a veteran.

Laura Schaffer (00:05:06):
Yeah, right.

Lenny (00:05:06):
I love it. Some companies, there's a little percentage of that shows you how many people have joined before you and I wonder what that percentage already is [inaudible 00:05:12].

Laura Schaffer (00:05:12):
We had that in Twilio and I got pretty, pretty high up there after a while. We had a stack rank and a spreadsheet. Yeah, but it is funny. So wherever that thing exists in Amplitude, I am right fresh there at the very bottom.

Lenny (00:05:25):
So what was the number you got to Twilio? Any, do you remember?

Laura Schaffer (00:05:28):
Yeah, no, I was very proud to crack the top 50. That was my claim the same because as people left, you move up. Right?

Lenny (00:05:36):
Right. Yeah, it's bittersweet.

Laura Schaffer (00:05:39):
Well, yeah, right. On one hand it's like, "Ooh, very cool." And one of the OGs on the other hand, it's like, "Oh my gosh, this person's [inaudible 00:05:47]. Bummer." It's a shift, but I'm excited about it for sure.

Lenny (00:05:51):
So you have this new exciting role and I thought it'd be fun to start to chat about career growth and just how you think about career growth. I know you have a framework of how you think about your own career growth and clearly it's worked out, so I'm curious to hear about it and see how it could be helpful to folks that are listening. So yeah, can you just tell us about how you think about career growth?

Laura Schaffer (00:06:11):
Career growth is definitely not a straight lineup, but there's definitely some frameworks and methods that have worked really well for me. And I think to dive into it, it's first good to just talk about the one that I most typically see people use to try to grow their career and why that can be a little problematic, which is that I see most people try to work really hard the job that they have within the role that they have at a company. Do whatever you can to grow there, show your manager all these things. I see people keep spreadsheets, it wins. So it can come up with performance reviews. Maybe you try to get better advocating for yourself, maybe try to get peers to notice or your manager's peers. And that's all good. It's all stuff.

(00:06:52):
But the problem with it is that you're limited to what your manager's ability is to advocate for you, to promote you. And you're also limited by the explicit trajectory of your role at that company and where the there's room for that or not at the company. And then often that perception can sometimes be a little bit in contrast to what your perception is. And also other things that happen, your manager leaves and then you have to restart with someone else. So the method that I use tries to take that power back a little bit. And something that I learned really early on in my career, I was very lucky to learn by accident, was at a company called Bandwidth, which is my first real job. And Bandwidth is now a public company and they've done all kinds of crazy amazing things.

(00:07:38):
But I joined when it was just 50 people and I actually joined in sales and I was just hungry to make it succeed and grow and bright eyes and everything, first real job. But I realized after a few months of being in sales that I was often repeating the same thing over again, using the same thing to sell over and over again. And it's like, gosh, this isn't ideal for the customer because [inaudible 00:08:04] call me and ask these questions and get these answers and all this stuff. And it's not ideal for the company because they're paying commission on this every time. That's not going to be efficient for our growth. And because we were small, I was able to catch our GM and I was just like, "Hey, I've noticed this pattern where I'm repeating things over and over again and they're asking the same thing.

(00:08:29):
I think we should put that online. I think we should make that available so they can just see it and then buy it," because we had an online checkout process. And I was expecting him to be like, "Oh, well, I know it's important but for this [inaudible 00:08:46] another, we need to do it this way, and obviously you've thought all about it." And thinking, "Oh, I'm going to come in this new person, he's just going to help me understand what I'm missing here." There's a little bit of that that I was expecting. And he goes, "Wait a minute, tell me more about that. What do you mean?" And by the end of the conversation he was like, "Hey, why don't you go do that? Why don't you go build that experience? Why don't you put that stuff in a self-serve flow?"

(00:09:06):
And we called it e-commerce manager and it was like got a growth before this growth, this is like 2010. And that moved me into a totally new position. And the main learning that I had from that was, which really took life at Twilio and absolutely worked for me there and I'm happy to talk about that too. But the core that learning was, your executive team and executive teams at companies are often very sharp, but the nature of their day-to-day just does not link them with customers.

(00:09:34):
And that means that over time, especially as a company grows, they often lose access to some of the best insights and in the heartbeat of the people who they're providing value to in contrast to folks that are closer to the problem. And so that means that your superpower is in really pulling those insights in and bringing them to life, staying close to the customer. There's not a single leader or executive that isn't going to be stoked to hear about valuable customer insights that highlight problems they might not be seeing. And there's a lot of those. So especially when they align to North Star metrics, those ones are the powerful ones. That was the way that I grew my career at Phil and I'm happy to share that journey too.

Lenny (00:10:18):
Yeah, it'd actually be cool to hear maybe another example of that. But I think an interesting thing that comes up for me here is sometimes you may have an awesome idea and it may not immediately happen. It may not be like, yes or let's move on, that's right, immediately. And I think it's important to just recognize they're not going to follow all your ideas, but they're always looking for better ideas. And to your point, they may not have the information that will lead to an idea that you will have because you're on the ground dealing with real problems, day-to-day. So I think it's important to recognize you're not going to always get your way and that's normal.

Laura Schaffer (00:10:52):
Yeah, totally. And it's almost like building up your individual brand a little bit. And I think one of the most powerful and accessible ways is learning about your customers. There's always those people at companies who's like, "Oh, well, she just knows our customers or he just knows our customers, they just know our customers. They just know." And it's like, "Well, how?" "They just know. Let's ask that person. Let's get their feedback." And those people often have a good amount of brand recognition of powers within the company and they're often thought of when the company needs to do something new or different or if someone is hiring, maybe they're thinking about that person for a cross team thing.

(00:11:31):
So it's one of the ways that you can build that brand. And again, I think it's a sweet spot because it's something that is very valuable to everyone, all the way up to the most senior leaders, which we can talk about here in a minute. And so it's going to be valuable for you in a valuable tool no matter where you're at in your career. And that's not always an immediate payoff, but it often does give you a trajectory outside of just your role and just your manager. It gives you something a little bit broader.

Lenny (00:12:05):
So maybe a simple way of describing to mirror back what you're saying is carve your own path. Don't necessarily assume your managers will give you the path that makes most sense for you or even give you the biggest opportunity. Just propose, "Hey, I think this might be a better opportunity and I'd love to pursue it." I'd love to hear the Twilio example if that's generally-

Laura Schaffer (00:12:25):
Yeah. So when I joined Twilio, there was no growth team at all, not even a breath of it. I joined in product marketing and I was leading our product marketing for our messaging lines, but I followed the same guy that I just mentioned. I made it my own personal policy to like, hey, I'm going to do my job. And I'm going to do well, I'm going to keep notes of things I'm doing well and all that stuff because it's good, but I'm also going to get to know our customers. And I'm going to get to know our customers really well and I'm going to pay attention when I'm connecting with them, not just about the space I'm in, but just broadly what are some of the pain points and things they're articulating that are relevant to the business and what we're trying to get done.

(00:13:00):
And one of the things that came up was that users were struggling and folks were struggling to get started and use Twilio. And that contrasted so deeply to some of the things that our executive team was saying and had high conviction in our company had high conviction, which is that Twilio was so easy to use. In fact, it was top three things about Twilio that we were really trying to get out of their brand. Were so easy. Developers love us, they say we're so easy. And there were tweets coming all the time, developers saying like, "Oh my gosh, they got started in a couple of minutes." So there's all these things that made that compound and made that conviction stick. But as I was talking to customers, I was hearing a very different story and it made sense as we were penetrating new markets, adding more products, we were adding complexity and we were pulling in folks who were a little bit less motivated and those things contributed to people saying this is difficult.

(00:13:55):
And so at the time, this wasn't a 50 person in where I could just go to the floor and go to someone and be like, "Hey, there's this thing I heard about, I think we should do something." But there was another tactic that I could take, and I just started sharing a voice of the customer report. I started sharing my insights, started writing down and just sharing them. And it became with digest and eventually people were like, "Hey, can you share it with me? Can you share with me? Can you get on your list? Can share with me?" And this was in a few months of me joining, I was doing this. And then that turned into, "Hey, you should host a quarterly voice to the customer session or for all of product." And this was a request that was coming from some of the senior leaders at the company.

(00:14:33):
And when our Jeff Lawson is our CEO at the time heard about, he started attending too. So now in the session I started pulling in other people's insights too, because now they had a forum for this. I could do that and have people send that to me and I could compile it and all of these things. So then this established me as that person who knows about the customer even after short tenure. And then when came time to do annual planning that year, and I joined in 2014 at the end, so this is 2015, I pitched this idea, "Hey, we think that it's easy. It is not. Here's data that I have, the information that I have and I think that we need to start a growth team here and that needs to be a core focus." And I was able to bring in a really critical partner to that and other folks who could support that because I had built up some of that trust.

(00:15:28):
So by the time I was making that pitch, I had someone on Andre Crow who was the seventh hire at Twilio and got to number three on that spreadsheet or whatever who was really close to the CEO being like, "Yeah, we desperately need this." I'm seeing this. He led a website, he basically created the Twilio brand and he led all the website stuff and he is like, "Yeah, we definitely need this." So not only did I have that little bit of trust from the executive team, but I also had folks who were just trusted on their own advocating and supporting this that I was doing. And so it was approved just almost very easily. I put stuff together for it, but it was the meeting before the meeting had already been done by this other thing. So it helped me create the growth engineering, growth product team at Twilio.

Lenny (00:16:14):
I love just how proactive your advice is here. There's a lot of people that don't do well and then just like, "Oh, I never had the opportunity or I kept got looked over all this time." And I love that there's all this just like, here's things you can be doing to get in front of people to provide value, to just create opportunity for yourself. Any other advice along the lines of just like, here's the things you could do for yourself versus waiting for someone to come and give you opportunity?

Laura Schaffer (00:16:42):
Yeah, I think that's the most easily actual because to do all of our jobs, we need to know customers, we need to know about customer insights, product, we need to know. But then also customer facing teams, social, those want to crack into product. Your insights are extremely valuable. You're talking to customers every day more about their problems and their pain than a lot of other people do. And so that is by far and away to me the most powerful and accessible by anyone in any role in any space. But I'll also say that that broader concept of just, hey, there's things that, and things of value that you know that others can benefit from at your company and building your brand as someone that is supportive, smart, creative, able to solve problems, make sure that you're sharing that. And so maybe you're really freaking good at communicating with brevity.

(00:17:35):
I suck at that by the way. So more powered anyone that can do that, I'm actively working on it. So share that. Go to your general Slack channel or whatever and just be like, "Hey, just wrote some tips for how to do it, some ways that I am good at this." And those kinds of things can really go a long way towards people starting to view you as an SME and not just the space that you're in, but in broader areas. And that can always present open doors for you and other people are looking up to you and seeing you, someone who's strong in ways outside of just the role that you're in.

Lenny (00:18:07):
SME is a Subject Matter Expert, is that right?

Laura Schaffer (00:18:10):
Yes. Thank you for unpacking my acronyms. That's another thing that I am actively working on.

Lenny (00:18:16):
I got you. I'll be on the lookout.

Laura Schaffer (00:18:16):
Yes.

Lenny (00:18:19):
Maybe one last question along these lines is do you have any advice for framing the proposal, framing an opportunity to your manager, higher ups that you see has worked best broadly?

Laura Schaffer (00:18:34):
Yeah. Yeah. And one thing I want to say too is with this stuff, I don't think that it necessarily does counter to what your manager's doing. It's more supporting them. I've done this stuff and then it's helped my manager promote me. So it's not necessarily, "Oh, we'll do this if your manager's failing you." Or they are not the boarding you or they can't support you. It's more like do this because this is going to be an accelerator for yourself irrespective of your manager.

(00:18:55):
But then also it'll be an accelerator for your manager in supporting you because one of the things that comes into play a lot when managers figure out promotions and doing those things is they'll sit in a room, often calibrations and with a bunch of people, and it makes it a lot easier when those people have had some access or exposure or whatever to you in a positive light. So these things can all run with your manager and not against, but it's just another way of you taking back the ability to build that momentum instead of relying on all of that going through one single other person.

Lenny (00:19:33):
And what I like about your second example is you just did it. You just started doing that tenant report for the company. It wasn't like, "Hey, I have a proposal, here's what I think you should do. Should we do it?"

Laura Schaffer (00:19:42):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:19:42):
It's just like, yeah, just do it.

Laura Schaffer (00:19:44):
Yeah, ungate your knowledge I think is the buzzword that I'm hearing.

Lenny (00:19:52):
Mm. Never heard that.

Laura Schaffer (00:19:52):
I think that's an Elena, see how many times we can bring her up. But you can do that within your own company. Everybody is skilled at things that they aren't explicit to their role or their space. And I think that ungating that opens opportunities. And if you're not sure, then go to my favorite go-to, which is talk to customers, get insights. Those are incredibly valuable. So rarely do people share those when they find them. So be the person that does that.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Another area I want to chat about is experimentation and growth and data, which makes sense if strong perspectives is on being the new head of growth amplitude. So maybe we start with experimentation. You mentioned that there's a really interesting surprising result in an experiment you ran at Twilio that maybe changed your perspective on experimentation and what you think might work and not work.

Laura Schaffer (00:20:45):
A hundred percent. Yeah, I'm through a fortune of two mind-blowing experiments that really shifted the way that I think about growth. So one of them, one of my favorite ones happened very early on at Twilio. So after I created this growth team, one of the things that I saw as to me an issue was that under signup flow, we just asked people for a username and an e-mail, like a password, and that was it. And that's actually relatively common at the time. This is a while ago now, everybody is [inaudible 00:21:16]. But we didn't, and actually there was a lot of existing conviction around that. I was like, "Hey, we retarding developers. Developers, they just want to do, they just want to get their hands on things. Don't put anything in their way, it's going to be disastrous. We don't want any shenanigans here with these folks, let's just let them in the gates."

(00:21:33):
But to me this was a really big assumption to make and a very costly one. It's like, okay, if that's the case, we're not going to know anything about anyone. And we didn't know who was signing up, we didn't know what they wanted to do. And that hurt our ability to understand how people were performing from a quantitative perspective. We were a little bit lost with prioritization. There's a number of implications here, but it's obviously a very contentious space. So this is the very first thing that I did and the first experiment that I ran. I did some research to understand say, okay, what are the most important questions to answer? What would I do really, really need to know? And it was stuff like what language are you coding in, what's your use case? What product you want to use?

(00:22:14):
And then there's one around, are you developer at all or were you use something else? Because there is rumors that we're having, not just developers sign up, which is this whole other interesting story. And I think of these questions that would also potentially be things that our developers signing up would understand why we're asking that it would feel natural. But anyway, again, adding anything to the signup was very contentious, but I really just wanted to get a little bit of data on it. So I wanted to run a test. I didn't have a team, I didn't have an engineering team yet and none of that stuff had built out. It was just me, myself and I. But like I said, I had started to build a little bit of trust and [inaudible 00:22:50], Andre, who I mentioned earlier who, because he was early employee and he had access to everything, one of those people, and he also was supportive of this and had similar haunches.

(00:23:03):
And so like the dead of the night, and by that, I mean 7:00 PM or something, I'm pretty sure it was a Friday. We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the signup flow and ran as Navy test with a small group. And I'm fully expecting, "Okay, this is going to hurt our numbers, but maybe it won't be so bad and I'm going to be prepared to advocate the power of this data that we're getting." I was totally thinking with written... Started to write the framework for how I wanted to surface this. And we start to get the data for this thing. I'm not kidding, an improved conversion. There's no personalization, nothing past it, just the questions. It improved conversion by 5%, just improved signups. And it was one of those like, "What? Okay, what is going on here?" And I actually dug into it, and what I found from just talking to a few customers once through the flow, I'm just learning about [inaudible 00:24:00] about it.

(00:24:01):
It was actually for folks, it was comforting. When you think about it, when users are signing up for your product for the very first time, it's new. This is new, that means it's scary. They're expecting it to be difficult. They're anticipating that there's going to be friction and challenges and that they're not going to figure it out. Almost like looking for the bogeyman. And that's the headspace. It's often the headspace that any of us are in when we're doing something new for the first time like ooh, this could be very challenging. And so by putting in these questions it's like, what's your language? It's like, "Oh, I do. I code a JavaScript and I can select that." Well, that's something I'm uncomfortable with. That would make my journey easier. Like "Yeah, bingo. That's my use case. Okay, I'm in the right place here."

(00:24:51):
It was actually giving folks something comforting and challenging the notion that this was going to be difficult, just the questions because it was aligning to some of the things that they were organically thinking about, which is what if they don't support my language? Or can I even do this use case I want to do? And so it was just a really interesting, the takeaway for me for this, the really interest takeaway was the psyche of the user is so, so critical. That's just as important as understanding your product and the broader market you're applying to and all those things. Just the psyche of users, new people doing things for the first time in your user flow, understanding that is powerful. And the simple catchy thing I say is that ultimately the learning here is, bad friction is bad, and good friction is good. There's no such thing as it being simple. It's just all friction is bad, which is what I had assumed going into this.

Lenny (00:25:50):
I love that you were new to Twilio and you just year-load an experiment to production.

Laura Schaffer (00:25:55):
Year-load. Yeah.

Lenny (00:25:56):
That's a big move.

Laura Schaffer (00:25:58):
It ended up being very helpful for everyone. I shared the insights from it and all these things. I've shared the [inaudible 00:26:05].

Lenny (00:26:05):
And [inaudible 00:26:05] conversion.

Laura Schaffer (00:26:08):
But for sure, use such processes with caution for sure. Yeah.

Lenny (00:26:08):
I love it. It's amazing.

Laura Schaffer (00:26:15):
That the right way to do [inaudible 00:26:15] advocating for the engineers here is the right way to make any changes in production is through or with the approval of engineering, but it was the right move overall and definitely helped business, so yeah.

Lenny (00:26:33):
Yeah, I love it. No, that's great. I like that move. I think we need more of that probably. I want to dig into what you actually... So what is it you changed, you added how many questions and then what were the questions?

Laura Schaffer (00:26:37):
There was a question around what language are you coding in? And then as an option to that, it was like, "Oh, I'm actually not coding, I'm not a developer." So for us, it actually gave us two really, really interesting data points. One was how many developers versus people who are not coding or in our flow? And then what language of the coding, which was massively helpful not just for growth and onboarding, but our documentation team, dos team. Would that end up being a critical way for us to gauge trends over time and catch things before whatever reports would come out at the end of the year, what people are doing, you start to see it. And then also product. What product are you interested in using? That was very critical for knowing the basics of how to organize someone's onboarding. Are you doing SMS? You're doing voice? To 281 or whatever. And then use case in use cases, you're doing a appointment reminders or are you doing a autoresponder or are you doing anonymous communications for a dating app or something. Right? So those were the very first questions.

Lenny (00:27:39):
Wow, okay. So it was four dropdown questions and that increased conversion. I love these examples where friction and increased conversion... There's so few of them. You hear about this could work and it's rare. And so what did you take away? What's the pattern you took from this? There's the idea, it's good friction, but is there something that you're like, what is a sign of this is going to be good friction?

Laura Schaffer (00:28:02):
There's still alleviated a problem. They alleviated the problem they had where they're coming in and worried that it was going to be difficult or that they weren't going to be able to figure it out, they weren't going to be able to get their footing. And I'd say that that's not unique to Twilio. That's something that I think users experience at any front door, at any company, any signup beginning the signup loads, it's like, "Here we go, buckle up." Especially when it's in a work context and there might be extra pressure on you to succeed or for you to make as an accurate assessment. So I think that psyche of, "Okay, am I in the right place? Is it's going to do what I need it to do? Can I figure it out? Am I capable?" These are extremely common things for people to feel when they're signing up.

(00:28:48):
And so certainly, that I think can carry out to any place. I'd encourage absolutely everybody to be putting those experiences within their early onboarding, not just for you selfishly, so you can learn and segment them appropriately, but also so the user can feel more confident as they get going and like, "Hey, I'm in the right place. This is going to do what I needed to do." But I think that the carry over there is just the psyche of the user and just being so aware that it's not so cookie cutter as, "What is the problem my market experience is and what can my product do to help them?" There's also this other thing in the room which is so important to people's success, their ability to succeed with your products and your self-serve experiences, which is, what is the mentality and the psyche of the person at the various stages in your journey?

(00:29:37):
And if you're not incorporating that or addressing that, you will absolutely miss things or things will fail and you'll be very confused as to why. We had a great experiment that I'm happy to talk about where same concept, a totally different situation, which is later in onboarding. One of the things that we tried to do over time to make Twilio less complex was to offer steps like, [inaudible 00:30:08] onboarding, welcome step one, here's what you want to build. Great, we all know that now, "Okay, step one, go do this thing. Step two, go to this thing. Three, this thing. Four, this thing. Five, bam, you're live, congratulations, aha," all these things. So we shipped that, got that out there and I was like, yeah, it was improved conversion. It wasn't like that great. It's like, man. We went from there being absolutely nothing, "Choose you're adventure, figure it out, go figure it out. Good luck." To this prescriptive thing. And it wasn't converting [inaudible 00:30:37].

(00:30:38):
So to talk to some users and there wasn't anything particularly obvious that was coming out as to what the issue was. It was like, "Oh yeah, Let's go to step one." And we did mock the people. "Okay, now I know, I do step two." But there was one thing that I was hearing that was coming out that feels like something, and that was the telephone number, the telecom part. Developers when they were coming into Twilio, it was things that were familiar to them. APIs, the language they're coding in, code samples, documentation, things like the bogeyman, the things that would psychologically trip them up, telecom, phone numbers. These things that just were completely out of the zone of anything that they'd ever worked with before, especially earlier on in Twilio's journey.

(00:31:28):
But even now, right? Telecom's very different beast for most developers. And guess what was step one? Get a phone number because that's step one. Anytime that anyone's trying to teach one to use Twilio one-on-one, always going to sit down, ask and be like, "Okay, here we're going to go get a phone number and configure it." And that's what anyone every time will do. However, in a self-serve experience, when you don't have that safe person sitting next to you being like, "Don't worry, it's going to be okay, I'm going to take you through this crazy telecom journey." They're on their own, but that's psyche telling is them like, "Oh my god, telecom. Well, I can't do that. That sounds scary. We're getting a phone number configured. Whoa, I'm out of my debt."

(00:32:01):
And so what did we do to test this out? Test out whether that was the issue? Actually, and it's first we're in the MVP. They kicked them out of the portal entirely and put them into a docs page where we could manufacture an experience where the first thing they saw was code and they're in the docs safe place, the language that they're coding in and then snuck in there.

(00:32:26):
It was like, "Oh, get a phone number, let's go configure it." Not as step one, not as the leading thing, but embedded. And the analogy I have for this is pilling a hot dog. So if anyone's got a dog or an animal you have to feed a pill to, it's like you can't just feed the pill to the animal, it's never going to happen. But if you shove it inside of a hot dog, which looks good and that's exciting, then you can get them to consume it more easily. And so this was-

Lenny (00:32:53):
Yeah. We do peanut butter, that's [inaudible 00:32:55].

Laura Schaffer (00:32:55):
Yeah, exactly, right? Yeah, hot hotdog, peanut butter, all that. You bury it. You embed the scary unpleasant thing. And so that's what you said with the phone number stuff, that telecom stuff. And guess what? Even though we're a good amount of the console and they're going off and we had no easy return button, it converted better because we were addressing the big problem that was there at the time, which is their psyche. They were not ready to come in and immediately thrown into a phone number experience. That was letting the bogeyman and out to party and that's not what was going to work. We needed to put that bogeyman pill and the hotdog.

(00:33:31):
And so then once that validated, then we can actually go through the business of putting that into the onboarding float correctly and then that could be even better. But so again, the psyche of your user is such a critical thing to be thinking about. And if something very logical isn't converting well sometimes, it means that you're battling against the psyche of a user and you want to take a step back and think about and learn about where someone is psychologically in your space.

Lenny (00:33:59):
Feels like you had this experiment that was a complete redesign of the onboarding flow and that didn't work. And then your second attempt was a different approach that's like a full onboarding flow. And I'm curious, do you have a take on just when you run experiments? And it's something we dealt with a lot at Airbnb in other places is like, do you just redesign the whole thing or is it better to iteratively work from where you're today and just experiment piece by piece towards some future much better experience?

Laura Schaffer (00:34:26):
Here's what I would say to this is that from a high level, it's always going to be better to be iterative. And the reason that it's better is that roughly 80% of the times, ORs in the time are hypotheses and the things that we believe will be true [inaudible 00:34:42]. And this is amazing. There's an amazing article out there I'm happy to share with you so you can put in the show notes.

Lenny (00:34:48):
Yeah, absolutely.

Laura Schaffer (00:34:49):
That really takes a scientific approach to proving that out. Companies like Netflix and Microsoft, there's over and over again 80 plus percent. Some companies say 90% of things fail. And so the closer you get to something that you go bear your head in the sand or go into an attic and build something for six months and ship it, the more likely it is that you are going to ship the 80% wrong stuff.

(00:35:17):
Whereas the more iterative you are, the more likely that you're going to catch it sooner. And failure doesn't have to be a wall, it can be a compass, it can be the thing that leads you to the right thing. And so you always want to as best you can, get stuff in front of customers so that you can get that compass and get that compass activated, know where to go.

(00:35:40):
So that means doing ugly things. I tell my teams all the time, if it's not embarrassing, you've gone too far. Got to be embarrassing. The first thing, that was embarrassing, kicking people out, onboarding, spend all this money and whatever to get them into your center flow, and then the first thing we do, get out of here. That's nuts. But if it hadn't validated, that would've been a very cheap but very valuable learning. Instead, it was a very powerful cheap learning in the other direction. Okay, now we know we can invest in it. We know that's the right thing to do. So always better to be iterative so that you are letting failure work for you instead of having it be a trap that you fall into.

Lenny (00:36:22):
I know that you just shared as per experiment, you're probably wrong 80% of the time. In my experience, launching a halt redesign is as negative a hundred percent of the time. I've grown weary to avoid that as much as possible, which is like, you know that, you're taught that as you go into growth and product, but you're just like, "Nah, come on, let's just make it awesome. Just redesign this whole thing." Especially your designers is always like, "No, let's start again. Let's make it amazing." But it always ends up being negative and you're like, "Okay, well, it's too late now we got to launch this thing, we don't have time to start again."

Laura Schaffer (00:36:52):
Well, it's funny, in the articles, and you'll see it was written by somebody from Microsoft who built Implementation platform and did all these cool things, as he went into actually trying to apply a scientific method of figuring out how often people are wrong about their hypotheses and what they're planning to do. He's like, "I wonder if that applies to us here at Microsoft." Even for him, that question of [inaudible 00:37:16]. And I think it's challenging when there's a lot of smart people in this space doing things and it's very difficult to think, "Gosh, am I really wrong? 80 plus, 90% of the time?" But when you think about it, makes total sense because what has to happen for something to be successful? You have to understand the problem perfectly. You have to then understand who's having the problem perfectly, the customer. At what time they're having the problem.

(00:37:43):
Then you've got to put the right solution in front of them to solve that problem. Maybe you've got the problem, all that stuff, but your solution something off. Or maybe your solution is right, but maybe it's just not presented, it communicated in the right way. You could have any one of those things off and it's not going to succeed. It's not going to have the metric impact you're expecting it to have. So in that context, it's almost like incredible. We do succeed 20 to 10% of the time given everything that has to line up. And so I think it's one of those things where you really want to go into it embracing that, "Okay, this isn't about how smart I am or how good my team is or any of that stuff. It's just the logic of this is challenging to get it right and let's embrace that and let's lean into that knowledge and make it a part of our strategy," instead of finding against it.

Lenny (00:38:39):
Have you found anything that helps you increase those odds or is just, this is the way of the world and you probably can't significantly increase the chances your experiment works out?

Laura Schaffer (00:38:51):
So here's the thing, I think there's very little that we can do to make that space easier. All those things have to be figured out. And so I definitely think that everybody is going to be in a space where their original ideas, untested ideas are going to be around that hit rate. However, the way that you go about validating those can be totally different and you can be very fast about validating those ideas and that's the key. And AB testing is one of the most expensive kinds of ways to validate an experiment. It often requires design and engineering and the PM or growth person or marketing person who's crafting it. All these things are investments that take a lot of time even for simple thing. And then you have the time factor, how long's the thing I have to run to have an impact?

(00:39:47):
So all of that is extremely expensive. And so I think the key is to just think through, "Okay, what are the things I can do to quickly validate what these ideas are that we [inaudible 00:39:59]?" And you can do that with painted doors, which is where you test rate the concept and the idea before it exists versus the actual experience. You can do mocks. If you've got a designer, create those mocks for that experience, put it in front of people, see how they engage with it. That can be so powerful.

(00:40:16):
You could invalidate tons of hypotheses at that state. The only things you want to get to that deep AB testing environment or ones that have been vetted along the way. And that way, you reduce your fail rate, because you're failing faster by using other methods. So I think I more advocate for that side. Let's fail fast by using those tools rather than figuring out a way that you can rise above where everyone else is operating and figure out ways to solve all that complex stuff better because that's going to be challenging, but you can always get better at experimenting and validating things faster.

Where do you find the best ideas come from for driving meaningful lift? Is it gut instinct type and experience bucket or is it data telling you like, "Hey, or here's a huge opportunity," in your experience?

Laura Schaffer (00:42:15):
I'm a very data-driven person. I self-describe and think of myself that way. In large part because of that, I feel you have to be constantly checking yourself and data is a really great way to do that. But I definitely think that I would be described as someone who's going more by their gut when looking at date end results just because of the way that I approach it, which is I'm very comfortable and very common in using qualitative responses and things like that and supplement to quantitative data to make a decision and that puts less of a burden on the quantitative to really make an assessment of whether something was working or not.

(00:42:51):
One of the things I see, I think sometimes goes against what other folks do, although I'm seeing things shift a little, is that 95% confidence rate. My background in college, I was in a lab running experiments or really publishing two journal and stuff and we had to have that 95% confidence rate, had to because the things that were coming out of the lab and being published were influencing things like how we do education and how we understand how bias works and when it shows up and therefore how we can combat it.

(00:43:23):
Things were wrong. And sending a bunch of bologna, that can cause some significantly bad things like false positive, false negatives in that context can be very dangerous, for lack of a better word. And you think of other pharmaceuticals, the 95% confidence rate belongs in some companies and some industries because the risk of failure on the impact of a false success is very high.

(00:43:47):
But those of us converting users and trying to upsell folks, we are very fortunate to not have that level of burden on us and we can take advantage of that. And so there are definitely times where I will advocate for and I will push for and I will myself use lower confidence intervals and 95%, especially if that doubles amount of experiments that you can run in a year. End of the day, these are all methods that we use to try to validate the hypotheses that we have. And if you're doing a 95% confidence in a role, you're still accepting a 5%, some amount of false success, do that a little bit more, challenge you to do that a little bit more. And then run way more experience. If you look at the net of what your team is doing over the course of year, what you're doing over the course of a year, you will be positive.

Lenny (00:44:42):
Wow, that is a big idea. Idea of releasing the P-value confidence interval for experimentation and data teams. Everyone would be excited about this. Probably maybe not some data scientists on teams. Do you do that? How do you act? Is that how you operate on your teams? Just like we don't need 95% competence?

Laura Schaffer (00:45:03):
So I'll say this, this is actually very critically important. You must have this game plan set before you run something. Failure mode that I see so many teams fall into is they'll run the experiment or whatever it is and then they'll make the data fit the hypothesis. Or sometimes they'll go without a hypothesis and just be like, "This is going to do better things for our metrics," but not a core reason as to why or what exactly are we testing here. And so this is another area we could absolutely fall into that trap. "Let's [inaudible 00:45:36] on good 80. I think it's good. That Laura person said it was cool. So I think that that's fine." That will always be a trap. So it needs to be very deliberately thought of in advance as a way of like, "Hey, here's how we're going to validate this." And always, always, always, if you're going to accept more risk of a false success or false positive, false negative, you want to then be really thinking about how you're going to harden your validation of a hypothesis.

(00:46:03):
For example, let's take that when we talked about with Twilio where we are kicking people out and we're sending them to the pilling hotdog experiment, and we're sending people to that experience to hide the phone number. Now in that case, let's say that we were going to accept a lower confidence interval. I would very much want to see qualitative feedback to confirm that that hypothesis was true. I want to be looking at the qualitative data from the ones where people were thrown into the existing flow and one's put into the dogs that one of them felt more confident and more like this was really easy to get through and they felt out of a territory and things like that. And I'd be wanting to hear from the ones who were in the other one, things like, "Oh, I got stuck on that [inaudible 00:46:48]." Like, "Figure this out, but it feels like it's that amount of my depth."

(00:46:52):
I would want to be looking for other things to corroborate the hard data that I'm seeing. And yes, it opens the door to whenever you open the door to more risk acceptance, you are going to have some false successes there. But all of these things together can overall make it more likely that you're shipping more things that are going to positively influence the customer. And again, I can't say it enough. It is a huge risk in and of itself to not ship as much as you possibly could in a year. That is a huge risk given that very high fail rate. So to those data scientists, and I've chatted with a few of my time, what I try to explain is that that article, that data that the 80%, that's hard data about what a detriment it can be if you don't run an enough experiments.

(00:47:51):
If you just run 10 in a year on there, maybe two around impact, two of a course of an entire year if you take that approach. So data scientists can understand, "Hey, if we do this, if we run this down, we can double or triple whatever it is, the number of experiments where we can run and overall net that's going to result in more successes that will overall net us to a positive place." You can still tell a data story to the data scientist about why you're doing this. Again, this is why when you asked that question identify, as a very data-driven person. But I think some of the methods that I use can sound at the service level as more like, "Oh, I'm going by my gut." But again, very data driven is just embracing the reality of some of the hard data that I don't think we all embrace or are even aware of sometimes about that fail rate.

Lenny (00:48:42):
This is awesome. This is a big idea. Have you written about this anywhere for folks that maybe want to try this approach at their company? And if not, you should.

Laura Schaffer (00:48:50):
I appreciate that. It's funny, it's like all my general life to do is just start writing some of this down. I have three children, one of whom is five months old, and then I have two and four. And so sometimes I'll start to write and then one of them will crawl across the keyboard. And by one of them, I mean all of multiple times. But eventually, yeah, I'll be very happy to do that if folks would be interested. I'm always happy to do whatever I can to help folks, help empower folks with knowledge to do better because none of this is secret sauce really. It's just learn from experience and it's always better to learn from others' experience than your own. It's faster. So yeah, I would definitely [inaudible 00:49:35] is that, I think that's the best that I can say, but eventually my kids will get older. I hear this and maybe I can do so.

Lenny (00:49:42):
Hopefully. Cool. So maybe if you're watching us on YouTube, leave a comment and if you want Laura to write in depth about this idea and spread it to your company. Okay, I want to talk about growth, but I have one last question just along the lines of experimentation. Is there any other just, I don't know, big lessons or takeaways of running experiments that would be interesting to share?

Laura Schaffer (00:50:02):
I think we got into this one a little bit, but I just really want to exclamation point, underline it, which is that notion of making the data wrap to fit a concept. I think a lot of teams feel and are under a lot of pressure to show progress and, "What did you do this month? Where did the metrics move?" And it can cause folks to feel like they have to do that, where it's like, "Oh gosh, this experiment." Everyone's got the experience where you run an experiment and you're like looking at the data, refresh, refresh, refresh, oh my gosh, and actually perform worse. Or it's not the same and, "Gosh, we got everyone really excited about this thing that we all worked on really hard. Like, oh my god, what are we going to say in the QBR or the monthly report?" Whatever it is that the results come to light.

(00:50:55):
And to this, I'd say this, that it's incredibly important for growth teams to educate out and for folks outside of growth and leading growth, especially to understand that the best way for a growth team to succeed, the only way really for them to succeed is to embrace the fact that they're there to validate, to understand what the biggest opportunities are and to go after them.

(00:51:24):
And that is not something that can be done on a weekly timeline, sometimes even a monthly, depending on the space you're in and what's known and unknown. And so any growth team that's beholden to short timeline wins and improvement is always going to be dangerous. That's an environment that's conducive to vanity Metric usage and massaging the data [inaudible 00:51:47]. And ones that are more successful are ones that are reporting over longer periods of time. Because I think growth team, given enough time to fail, enough time to learn the right thing to do is absolutely going to show success, real success. Not that, "Okay, we're going to make this data fit." But real moving the metrics success.

(00:52:03):
And so definitely educating out. If you find yourself in a position where you are beholden to that, share that 80% fail rate. Just math, statistics, data. You cannot be successful in an environment, but over time you can be. And so that's one thing I definitely would draw on. I end up spending a decent amount of my pie chart at Twilio and then also at Rapid where I was after that and I'm sure I'll spend some time at Amplitude as well. Just helping folks understand what is the healthiest ecosystem, most powerful ecosystem for a growth team to operate in. And time and expectations over time is a big part of that.

Lenny (00:52:46):
When you say pie chart, it's like the pie chart of your time like a big chunk of your time goes to this?

Laura Schaffer (00:52:46):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:52:50):
That's awesome. I like that. I use white charts a lot as to describe that same idea. Just to be a little more concrete there, what is the timeframe you think is the minimum for a growth team to be thinking across?

Laura Schaffer (00:53:01):
I think it's good, especially for newer teams, but even teams in general. Commit to something that you can do over the course of a year and low, medium, high is always helpful in that space. A lot times-

Lenny (00:53:01):
What do you mean by that, by low, medium, high?

Laura Schaffer (00:53:17):
Low, medium high, more like, "Hey we've got a few bets that we have or few core hypotheses." And if they take off that's going to be our high bucket like, wow [inaudible 00:53:26]. We think these things could become lightening on a bottle here, but they could also be a bunch of [inaudible 00:53:31] missed. But until we run in, we're not going to know. And if those bear out though, then yeah, that's our high. And hey, we've got a few things that we think are safer. Maybe it was validated a bit in the previous year, what have you. And these looking really the metrics this amount.

(00:53:45):
So it's helpful to give people though that construct, it deviates from it very hard deviates from this notion of like, here's the single number that we're going to hit. Just things that help people understand that space a little bit better and what to expect. And because of that it can be a little bit lumpy. There were some things that you released. Truly for the most number of years, can be easiest to talk about in this construct here, but there's one thing that we did that generated tens of millions of dollars in the pipeline, was really, really powerful and took, sometimes navigate and validate. Other times we did that onboarding stuff that I was talking about catching those things. That could happen on a little bit of a faster clip but still took some time to validate and understand. But yeah, over the course of a year you should generally be able to commit to movement. But help people understand the methods there so that they're not coming at you on a weekly basis being like, "And what did you do these past couple days?"

Lenny (00:54:44):
Okay, I got to follow up on a couple of these things. What was that big change of Twilio that lead to tens of millions of dollars?

Laura Schaffer (00:54:50):
This is part of the course that I teach at Reforge.

Lenny (00:54:55):
Oh, amazing. You get to work for Reforge with [inaudible 00:54:57].

Laura Schaffer (00:55:04):
I'm actually interested in retention, I think is my part. Right now, I'll give you links so we can [inaudible 00:55:05] in the show notes. But yeah, the high level version, this was deeper into my journey at Twilio. This is fast-forward a few years, build up this team and some cool things going on. But I was really looking for what's the next big thing for us to do? What could that be? And I noticed, remember that question very back of the day when I asked about the developer versus not developer folks [inaudible 00:55:34]?

Lenny (00:55:33):
Mm. Yeah.

Laura Schaffer (00:55:35):
We saw that little non-developer little dude ad was growing. We were actually the number of people in the ecosystem who were identifying themselves as not a developer were in the space.

(00:55:46):
But very interestingly they were, as we got more refined in our understanding of those folks, a lot of them wanted to build with Twilio. There was a hypothesis of like, "Oh well maybe they're lost, maybe this want pricing, maybe they [inaudible 00:56:00] mistake." And I was like, "Nope, they're here to build, they won't build." And they struggled through the developer on onboarding and some of them would succeed and some would... But anyway, it was all about identifying what did they need to succeed. If we were made them successful, could it contribute to dollars? One of the core learnings I'd heard from sales at the time was, "Hey, it's very challenging for us to get the folks when a developer's not involved yet to go from zero to one to get something off the ground. But man, if we can get them to do that, if I can get them in $1 and spend, I can get them to five. If I get them to five, and get them to 50, like 10,000, then I can get them to hundred thousand."

(00:56:39):
This whole long journey like, "Hey, Laura, if your team could just get them off the ground, man, we can do so much." So yeah, the journey is all about, okay, what were the things that were missing in the experience we were offering and ultimately was they couldn't write code from scratch. That was really difficult. And also we're going to stand up a server. That was difficult. But we ended up iteratively experiencing a way to validate those hypotheses and what's the right way to do this and yeah, that was great. It's called quick deploy on code exchange. Anyone can go there and deploy an app without having to write code and get an aha moment there with Twilio.

Lenny (00:57:16):
That is awesome. So basically it's like a low code Twilio app?

Laura Schaffer (00:57:20):
Yeah, it ended up being, we had a lot of pet names, nicknames for it. I think probably the one that most succinctly describes it as just, it ended up being a create your own demo experience which made you talk about the psyche of people. We talked about how developers telecom until can be intimidating. We'll talk about the non-development, sometimes the buyers or the people who are instantly buying decisions, for them, it was not only was it telco, but it was the developer stuff was inaccessible but they still wanted to jump in and they wanted to have that experience. And so this was a way for us to give them momentum, give them comfortable. Geez, I can get this running my development team, I'd definitely do it. And so it was a very powerful moment where we could really address the psyche of those users, get them excited about Twilio, and then give sales the ability to give something powerful to those non-engineering buyers and folks they're talking to.

Lenny (00:58:17):
So genius, looking back seems like an obvious win. One of my readers suggested that I start a series of the story of a feature and walk through the discovery ideation development iteration and this feels like a really interesting example of that. But anyway. I got just a couple more questions. I know we've been going for an hour now. But I have questions, I don't want to let you go just yet, and they're on growth. So one question is just you worked at Twilio, which is very product led growth. You're now Amplitude, which is more sales driven and I know you're trying to go more product led. I know Elena talks a lot about this, how every company needs to have product led motions, otherwise they're going to be disrupted by someone that comes product led. And I don't know what hires, which blanket would they fall into?

Laura Schaffer (00:59:05):
Between the AI like SLG and PLG. Yeah, for me they're two sides of the same coin. Product growth and sales. It's all to me, very thematically the same stuff. The difference is that with growth, you are selling with your product, and with sales you're selling with person like one-to-one. And so companies need to be employing both of those forces to optimally convert their audience. We're in a world where people are expecting both. They're expecting to be sold by your product and sold at the enterprise level. And large companies buy by human beings. It's going to listen to their specific needs and really break it off for them. And if you only have one, you're going to miss stuff. So absolutely, I think you want those two forces together working well. And obviously there's different stages, things work differently in different spaces, but I think when it comes to Amplitude, I think there's a huge opportunity here.

(01:00:06):
I think the key is, and that the challenge for companies that have done the sales thing and are trying to crack into the PLG thing really comes down to how you fundamentally are approaching that space. And again, your users and where they're at and the psyche of where they're at, I think a lot of companies will say, "Well okay, hey, we're going to do this PLG stuff. Let's take that sales enterprise whatever offering that we have and let's chop it up a bit and cut access here and cut out this feature here and we're going to slap this plan out and we're going to put a price on it and we'll maybe have hours of debates over whether it's like 10 99 or $104 or 75, and eventually someone will win that battle and slap it on and then [inaudible 01:00:54]." And anyway, the discussion of the focus is a lot around the product.

(01:00:58):
What are we going to do with this product? How are we going to crack it open and shift shift it in and then give it to these people, these users, these visitors? And what it's missing, I think is, and a lot of times it's easy to miss, is that when we're doing PLG and we're shifting from sales to PLG, we need to reset. We need to recognize that, again, this is sales, sales via the product. What does a good sales rep do when they're engaging? They understand what the problem is of the person in the space they're talking to. So we need the same thing here. What are the unique problems of people who are coming into our self-serve space? And I think when it comes to a company like Amplitude, a lot of the folks that will be looking to address via the PLG motion, there's a number of things we want to achieve there, but one of the primary things is to tap into the SMV market market and really give them a really startups and give them a space to land and to grow.

(01:01:57):
And again, you have to think what are the challenges and unique problems that they have because we're going to be using our product to settle them. We need to meet them where they're at with the problems that they've got. And I think one of the things that I've observed from being in all these startups and advising some startups is I very rarely... I don't think I've ever come across a startup where they have the right number of analysts for their needs. In fact, a lot of them don't have any. And so what that means is that the CEO is being an analyst to create their dashboards for the board and the product manager is being an analyst to figure out what the heck's going on and creating their boards for their product.

(01:02:34):
And that's happening all over the place is that people are in their roles and they have to be an analysts too. And I think that that's a problem that especially younger companies and early stage companies have. And so when they connect their psyche, what are they caring about? What are they thinking about when they're sending it for product analytic product or something? They're looking for something that's going to help them feel reassured they're going to be able to actually get to the bottom of the right metrics, create the reports that show things the right way. What's the best way to show churn? There's got to be a best way so many people are doing it. Guess what? Yes, there are some really good ways to do it and there are some really successful ways to set up dashboards for the board. People have done that too.

(01:03:16):
There's a lot of that knowledge that exists in one of those frameworks that exist, benchmarking. Are these numbers even good? And so, one of the hypotheses that I have is that if we take that perspective and we understand that that is the problem, that there's a number of things that we can do to really change the way that self-serve experience works to help convert people and show them how Amplitude can make them that powerful. But the thing that I think sticks across all companies, not just amplitude making the shift, is just that, that when you're doing this, do not think this is a copy paste, but chop it for parts thing. Don't start with your product when you're building at your strategy, start with your customers, your users, your prospects, the people who are going to be coming into yourself or flow. Make sure you are understanding how their problems differ because they do from the people that you're addressing at the sales led side. And then make sure that you're orienting your experience of product around those people.

Lenny (01:04:12):
It's interesting that you almost have to start again as a product company, as a product because you may need to solve completely different problems that eventually lead to the same place. But it's interesting what you're saying that you may end up targeting analysts or PMs. I know Amplitude or has always focused on PMs, but-

Laura Schaffer (01:04:32):
Yeah, it's right. And there's always nice thing about it is it's in some ways, it does feel like you're starting fresh because you do need to start with the customer again and what's their problem. But in a lot of ways, you can carry over a lot of the same knowledge. At that point you know what's working well. Amplitude for example, does have a ton of knowledge around what some of the best ways artists set up reports. There's a lot of things that they have the momentum going, like where do you choose that momentum and how do you put that and curate that in front of users and make sure that they're getting the right things. There's a ton of momentum already there. It's just a little bit about harnessing it and understanding like, yeah, where are the gaps because there are going to be gaps.

(01:05:08):
But anchoring in a customer problem as I think the way that you start any new product, any new thing that you're releasing, should always think about the customer and the pain point. So no different than when you're doing PLG for the first time or cracking into it. You need to be thinking again, starting again with the problem, the problems they have, the psyche that they have coming to your space so that you can build something that is going to effectively make them feel like, "Oh you can solve my problem, you get me." And show them how your product's going to do that.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Final question, and this is around developers. You worked at Twilio, obviously Twilio sold developers. I think Rapid where you work right before Amplitude also sold developers. Selling to developers feels like such a hot space right now. There's so many startups that are just building developer tools, such a huge market. Used to be not. Used to be like there's not a market in developers. They're not going to spend money, there's not enough of them. And now it is a big popular spot. And so I'm curious, what have you learned about building a startup and a product that sells to developers? I imagine a lot of founders building search tools would be really curious.

Laura Schaffer (01:06:16):
The first is that developers are just a very different audience from any others. I've seen so many people who have come in strong on growth really well or product really well with other audiences and like, "Oh, I'm going to take all those learnings, I'll pivot into serving developers." And as it being a very steep climb because developers are so different. And let me give you a couple just fun facts that make them really different. And some of these have some interesting stories. One is developers, almost two, one, do not look at your marketing website at all. They go straight to your signup flow. So what that means is all that beautiful context that you're setting and the product aid pricing, all that stuff, very often they're skipping all of it context free and going straight to your signup. And so anytime you make an assumption like, "Oh, well, they probably know this coming in to signup." Or like, "Well, we don't need to include, that's on the marketing website." None of that's going to apply to this group of people.

(01:07:15):
They're there. The analogy I have for this group is they're the IKEA buyers who when IKEA package comes, they're not opening up the instruction manual and reading in and then starting to go through, they're in there tearing open the bags and starting to pull the pieces together and trying to build it. They'll come up for context and steps and such when they get stuck if they're motivated. So that's one thing. And then another one is just the aversion to talking to sales. And I think hearing that, some they're like, "Oh yeah, well, I hate sales too." When I'm sent out and get bombarded by sales, that's the worst. I totally get that. But developers are on this whole other level. There was a fang company sign up for Twilio, built a POC, launched to production, all this, and operated in that space for months without engaging once with sales.

(01:08:12):
I was trying to reach them and I ended up being the one that talked to them first because they reached out to support because there was something about their delivery that was off ,there missing a feature and they did not want to talk to sales. They ended up talking to me when I was in product marketing. And that was my first exposure of like, these people not want to talk to sales. And then there's another one where a giant retail company where the engineering team signed up with their personal e-mail addresses so they wouldn't get bombarded by sales. It was only later that we found out. Anyway. But the thing that's most important, these are fun facts, but the thing that I would say is the most important, the thing to leave with listeners here is what makes them so different?

(01:08:54):
Why? What's the deal here? And it stems from their charter and their responsibility. So if we put ourselves in developer's shoes for a minute, a developer, if a developer is required to use your product, especially if they're the primary user, the primary builder, it's really important to recognize that they're responsible for that. If your service goes down, that's their responsibility. Not just for themselves but their team. If the pager wakes up someone because the service they bought from you goes down, that's on them. If, oh, it turns out that doesn't work with the systems that they said it was, well, that's on them. Doesn't integrate with the data the way that everyone wanted it to? That's on them. Everyone lives to developer when it's not working right and it cannot work right. In so many ways, that's their failure, it can cost them their job, it could cost them the trust to their team.

(01:09:50):
It cost them their reputation. And that means that the stakes are very high for them every time that they're adopting something new. So they can't afford to take someone's word for it. Especially a sales rep who might have some other motivations from their perspective, they can't afford to trust your content or someone's word. They must do it. They must prove it themselves. And so that's why, for developers to be bought in, they need to do something, build something, a proof of concept at the very least, if not moving further than that. And so that means they're going to be pretty darn deep in their self-serve experience with you before they're ready to commit. And so if you are a company that is providing, that requires developers to build, you must invest in self-serve experiences in order to effectively convert your audience. And you should be thinking of them. Something akin your self-serve function and growth folks, someone akin to Salesforce because your developers are not going to accept sales coming in and trying to convert them at that stage.

Lenny (01:11:00):
I love that you always come back to the psyche of the user and how in this case, developers like, here's why they're responsible for this thing. Salespeople are going to convince them this is going to work. And it's not. That's a really interesting tool and that's a really cool takeaway.

(01:11:16):
Is there anything else that we didn't cover before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Laura Schaffer (01:11:20):
Plenty. I think we covered it all, man.

Lenny (01:11:22):
You got all my questions and more. So with that, welcome to the very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Laura Schaffer (01:11:30):
I am so ready.

Lenny (01:11:31):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Laura Schaffer (01:11:35):
I'm a big believer in happiness. Not just being crunchy or we should all be happy, but also because it helps us do our best work and we're more creative and all this. So one is Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins. I don't ignore the data, that money is something that often gets in the way of our happiness. I know so many smart people that just have not figured out the whole managing their finances thing. And this book will cover all of your basics. It's very easy to read. He's got an audiobook that he narrates himself. Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins, he's fantastic.

Lenny (01:12:12):
What's a recent movie... Oh wait, wait, there's more?

Laura Schaffer (01:12:12):
Oh, there's one more.

Lenny (01:12:18):
Oh, let's do it. Let's do it.

Laura Schaffer (01:12:18):
[inaudible 01:12:18] Happiness, which is Atomic Habits by James Clear. If you ever want to change something about yourself or something's not quite working for you, this guy will give you a framework to change it. Guaranteed.

Lenny (01:12:30):
I really enjoyed that book. That guy's killing it. He was on Tim Ferris, he had a great interview. Folks that don't want to read it, they could listen to that. There's a lot of cool tips there. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Laura Schaffer (01:12:39):
Unabashedly, the Great British Baking Show. I love that show. I love that show for all the reasons everyone loves that show. It's heartwarming and makes you feel good and uplifts you. But also because it is a competitive show. They're trying to be the best baker and they're out there helping each other. They're like a big family. Most reality competitive TV shows that I see, all of them are like cutthroat, they're sabotaging. So I'm just endlessly fascinated also by the psychology of what's happening here. I want somebody to do a research paper on it, get to the bottom of why they're all helping each other. It's wonderful though. Wonderful to watch.

Lenny (01:13:18):
Interesting. I always comes back to psychology with you.

Laura Schaffer (01:13:24):
I know. I know. I feel like I'm really, really sinking deep in there. And it's true though. It's very interesting to me, and I love that show.

Lenny (01:13:30):
What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask in interviews?

Laura Schaffer (01:13:34):
I love asking about a ship or release that is not cherry-picked by the person you're talking to. You can get it a lot of different ways. The thing is, everyone has a big success story. Everyone does. It really doesn't actually tell you very much to ask someone like, "What's a great thing you released?" Because everyone could tell that. Instead, take that away. What's the most recent ship is a really easy one because recency, time. But there's other things you can do to take that out. Just give them specific parameters for a ship that they've shared or whatever, and that will allow you to listen more and learn more about their frameworks versus the outcomes. Because if you're picking a random ship, odds are it probably wasn't fantastic. So they're going to want to talk more about how they approach getting there and that's what you want to know about to know if they're going to succeed, what their frameworks to how they approach things.

Lenny (01:14:24):
That is cool. I've never heard that one. That is a really clever idea. What are five SaaS products that you use in your day-to-day work? Can't say Amplitude.

Laura Schaffer (01:14:33):
I know, right? Still learning which ones we have here. But yeah, I'll just share the ones that I like a lot that I've used elsewhere. So one is Hotjar. Hot Jar [inaudible 01:14:44] also works. Just anything that allows you to put some quick little thing in front of customers, get that qualitative feedback we talked about. It's a critical, critical supplement to quantitative data to understand what's really causing the change or not causing the change [inaudible 01:14:58]. So that's important. I will say Amplitude is a fantastic tool that I have used and I would've said that if I hadn't just joined Amplitude so I got to use it... I know. I got to use it for the first time at Amplitude and it was awesome. So again, like asterisk, because I'm like working there now, but I do actually like it. And Slack, it's boring, everyone says Slack, but I just have to hand it to them.

(01:15:26):
It makes life so much easier and just nod their way. And then Builder, which I'll also put in asterisk on that one, but I really want to serve this. A lot of people don't know about it and it's really helpful. I do advise them so I'm in their corner. But this is another one I also say would be a powerful one. I think a lot of team gets stuck. They're relying on too much in their engineers to make changes. Again, we talk about rapid experimentation, getting these out, out, out. And Builder makes it really easy for folks to do that. Also, a headless CMS, you can drag and drop headless CMS so they do make it easy for non-engineers to make changes. So especially if you're trying to figure out how to get around that 80% [inaudible 01:16:11] that I mentioned, this builder would be a good way.

(01:16:14):
And then yeah, if you want one more, I'll give you Chat GPT, which is really boring and everyone's saying that, but I think I'll just say I don't have any crazy things to say about it except that I do think we all need to figure out how we pull that in to [inaudible 01:16:28] put people who don't do that are probably going to lose out or smart AI whatever bots. But that would be it for you, Lenny. But if you ask me in a few months after I've actually been an Amplitude for a bit, I'm sure I'd give you a different answer.

Lenny (01:16:42):
That's a good time to plug lennybot.com. And I wrote a newsletter or Dan Shipper who created the bot wrote a newsletter post about how he built this thing. And so you could go ask me questions using the content of my newsletter as answers. And it's very cool. Lennybot.com or lennysbot.com.

Laura Schaffer (01:17:00):
Amazing.

Lenny (01:17:01):
There we go.

Laura Schaffer (01:17:03):
I didn't know about that. Well, there you go. I've changed my answer. It's that.

Lenny (01:17:05):
Yeah, there we go. That's all I need.

(01:17:09):
Two more questions. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a lot of impact on your team's ability to execute?

Laura Schaffer (01:17:17):
Yeah, the be embarrassed thing, like I mentioned earlier, be Embarrassed by the first iteration. If you are not embarrassed, you've gone too far. That really speeds up ships and helps people celebrate the unpolished as opposed to feel embarrassed about it. So just embracing that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. And final question. I know you just started Amplitude, but do you have a favorite pro-tip for how to use Amplitude or maybe Hidden Feature people may not know about?

Laura Schaffer (01:17:44):
You tell me [inaudible 01:17:45], but I'll say one thing that was super cool actually that someone put together on my team at Rapid, literally before I left, he put together a video of how powerful Amplitude could be when linked up and integrated with other things like in this case Hotjar and Segment. There was a Amplitude report that someone had created and there was something that was an anomaly happening there. Users were using something in a way we didn't expect and Amplitude one of the reports surface it, but Al Kirsten, we want to know why is that happening. And so we could find out what the event is and then using by Segment, find out what that name was and look at Hotjar and actually go in and get screencasts of people doing that exact event.

(01:18:30):
And from that, we were able to form some really concrete hypotheses about what actually was causing it. And so obviously talking to customers is very powerful, but in this case, just that simple use of connecting and threading those technologies together could really get a good picture of that without needing to engage customers. So the tip would be how you can really amplify when you get an amplitude when you use it with.

Lenny (01:18:59):
Amazing. Laura, we covered a lot of ground, career experimentation, growth, embarrassment, psychology. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks finding online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe send you an appreciation or two? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Laura Schaffer (01:19:17):
Yeah, find me on LinkedIn. I don't post a lot. Yeah, I'll blame my three children. Eventually, I promise that I will. But I'm pretty good about responding to messages, so definitely link with me there.

(01:19:29):
And then what listeners can do, I think I'm always happy to hear feedback, suggestion, all that, but I'll just say I also know that it's a little bit crazy out there right now, especially folks working in tech. So I'm also cognizant what I might be able to do to help all of you. I know there's a few places I advise and rapids hiring. I know of a few folks that are hiring growth, strong growth people and product folks. So if you are interested in learning more about that, don't hesitate to hit me up. I want to make sure that I help as many people as I can in that respect because it's trying times and I'm sure you've heard it and read it, but if you're laid off, this is not about you, it's not your fault. It's this crazy world we're in. Things will get better. And I would be feel very lucky if I could help even one person land. So feel free to hit me up about that too.

Lenny (01:20:21):
Awesome. And maybe if you share some links, we could include links to open roles in the show notes.

Laura Schaffer (01:20:26):
Yes. I know there's a few that don't have JDs open yet. They're that hot off the press, but I'm happy to surface a few things there for sure because I know that makes it easier for people to know.

Lenny (01:20:37):
Awesome. We will do our best with the show notes then. Laura, thank you again for being here.

Laura Schaffer (01:20:43):
Yeah, thanks so much for having me. This was awesome and so much fun.

Lenny (01:20:47):

# Mastering onboarding | Lauryn Isford (Head of Growth at Airtable)

## Transcript

Lauryn Isford (00:00:00):
An activation rate that falls in a lower percentage range, maybe for most companies five to 15%, is better than one that falls in a higher percentage range because it means that there's likely much higher correlation with long-term retention and you're really working hard to get most of your users to reach a state that they're not reaching today.

Lenny (00:00:24):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Lauryn Isford. Lauryn was most recently head of growth at Airtable. Before that, she was a product growth lead at Facebook, working on user growth, internet.org, and growth of Facebook at India. Before that, interestingly, she led growth for Blue Bottle's e-commerce business. In our conversation, we dive deep into Lauryn's favorite topic, onboarding, why it's one of the biggest and most undervalued growth levers, what she's learned about optimizing onboarding flow through her work redoing Airtable's onboarding flow, what she's seen work and common pitfalls around onboarding, plus a ton of advice around figuring out your activation metric. I could talk all day with Lauryn about growth, but we had to cut this off to keep this to a reasonable length. Enjoy my conversation with Lauryn Isford after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:01:19):
This episode is brought to you by public.com, who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year high, but buying US Treasuries is super complicated if you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US Treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, you can access your cash whenever you want, even before your Treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your Treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield, and you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a Treasury account at public.com/lenny.

(00:02:24):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours and mine. I have a quick request, head on over to my board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guest you'd love for me to have on in 2023, and while you're on the Miro board, feel free to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to work closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and iterate quickly and easily on anything you're working on. For example, in Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team sprints. Your whole distributed team can come together around a wireframe and draw ideas with a pen tool or even put mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made template, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmap to customer journey flows, final mocks, you get the picture. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

Lauryn, welcome to the podcast.

Lauryn Isford (00:03:28):
Thank you. I'm so excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:31):
We've chatted a bunch over Slacks, like all these different Slacks we're in and Twitter and emails, but we've never actually chatted real time, and so I have a million questions that I want to ask you. So, thank you again for being here.

Lauryn Isford (00:03:42):
We have never chatted real time, so everybody's getting the first conversation and I'm really looking forward to it.

Lenny (00:03:48):
I know that you have this pretty spicy contrarian take on experimentation and that I think you believe people run experiments too often and maybe not everything should be an experiment. Can you talk about that?

Lauryn Isford (00:04:00):
Yes. So, experimentation is a really big part, growth culture, growth hacking culture, PLG culture, growth marketing culture, any kind of growth, at least in my sphere, and sometimes teams can be really, really dependent on experimentation when trying to grow a business. A great example of this would be consumer growth at scale. Think your classic big social company. I worked at one of them. I am a former employee of Meta back when it was called Facebook. When you're at scale trying to grow a social app, experimenting can feel second nature. It can feel like a necessary step in your product development process that you want to drive more signups or you want to drive better activation with new customers. So, you change some buttons, change a design, and A/B test it, and then see if numbers go up or down, and then make your ship decision based on it.

(00:04:56):
I find that there's generally two reasons why a grow team wants to experiment, and one of them is to understand more precisely the metric impact of what they're building and what they're putting in front of customers, and the other is risk mitigation where you're making so many big dramatic changes that there's some risk that while this could be really great for the business, it could also be really bad and it would be good to understand that before everybody's experiencing that in production. So, with that framework in mind, sometimes you don't need to experiment. Sometimes if the business, let's say activation, right, activation rates go up 6% versus 7%, that precision actually doesn't help all that much beyond being able to say in your performance review, "Hey, I increased activation by 7%." So, it also is expensive to have folks on the ground, be it engineers, analysts, product managers, spending time understanding the results of an experiment that could otherwise be spent on road mapping, on foundational analysis, on shipping things. So, experiments can be expensive.

(00:06:09):
So, with all that said, generally my advice is to experiment when you need to and to primarily see it as a risk mitigation tactic when you're making dramatic changes and to let the product development process do more work. So, spend more time with customers, be more rigorous in understanding precisely what problem you're solving, get mocks in front of people and see how they react, and hopefully have more conviction than you otherwise would when you ship something that it's okay if every customer sees it tomorrow and that the experiment doesn't actually matter as much.

Lenny (00:06:44):
It's so interesting hearing that from a head of growth person. Working at Airbnb for a long time, and you talked about this, there's so much value put into the amount your experiment moves the metric is so important to, like you said, your performance review, your team's status, your team's ability to show they were successful. People look at like, you drove this metric 14%, which oftentimes you add up from experiments you've ran. How do you work in a culture like that, or is it just in that culture you may as well run experiments because that's the only way you get credit for the work you do, or is there a way to just be like, "Wow, that is how we measure it, but it's still maybe not worth running everything as an experiment"? How do you kind of find that balance?

Lauryn Isford (00:07:29):
It feels to me like that is the default culture, especially as growth teams become organizations and as those organizations grow with companies into growth stage public company territory and beyond. However, I do think you can build a different culture, and the only way to escape the trap of experimenting everything is to have a very intentional culture about doing right by customers and doing the right thing for the business. A growth team or a growth org exists in service of improving the business and delivering results for the business, and whether or not you measure those precisely in an A/B test, you still shipped them or you didn't.

(00:08:09):
So, the rigor around your process was either there or it wasn't. This means though that there have to be other ways to motivate, reward, retain, and develop really good talent. So, a culture around the impact you had on customers as measured by qualitative feedback or as measured by deals that were closed or deals that weren't lost, or other kinds of indicators that you did the right thing for customers is important and there shouldn't be, especially in engineering within the world of growth, a culture around having to point to numbers to demonstrate your impact because if there is, then the team will biased experiments all the time, and that's not necessarily the right thing for the business. It's a very expensive cost.

Lenny (00:08:50):
Wow. It's so wild hearing this from, again, a head of growth, someone that's so analytical like you. Is there an example of something you launched that maybe most people would've run an experiment and you decided not to for one of these reasons?

Lauryn Isford (00:09:01):
There is a feature, a product really, that Airtable offers called Airtable Forms. It's possible you've used it. I'm not sure if you have, but-

Lenny (00:09:10):
No, I don't think so, but I will go check it out.

Lauryn Isford (00:09:12):
You can check it out. There are some new features I'm about to tell you about, so maybe that will entice you.

Lenny (00:09:16):
There we go. Scoops.

Lauryn Isford (00:09:18):
So, Airtable Forms is much like other forms products. You can create a form and then send it to anybody to submit. The people who submit your form don't need to be a user of Airtable.

Lenny (00:09:30):
Oh yeah, I have used that. Okay. It's just like the turn an Airtable into a form. Yes, I've used it. Okay.

Lauryn Isford (00:09:35):
Exactly. So, something we noticed is that there was a gap in feature parity for Airtable Forms where the submitter could not request a copy of their submission. So, I might send my T-shirt size to Lenny for a form around ordering swag for the company and then I might want to remember which T-shirt size that I ordered and get a copy of that in my email. We created that feature which as a result was gated on creating an account with Airtable, and we just turned it on and wanted to see what would happen because we knew from rigor of a wonderful product team doing robust customer analysis and also doing the data work that this is something that people wanted, that it was a feature that would bring value to customers, and that even if it didn't move certain metrics like a signup percentage, even if it might affect the mix shift of activation rate from folks who signed up, it would be net good for customers who were using forms and who were submitting them.

(00:10:35):
So, we did roll that one out without an A/B test. It did have a big enough impact on our signup metrics that we saw at top line and didn't need the A/B test to see what was happening. And we also were able to use attribution to make some analysis possible after we rolled it out so we could learn from what was happening to the base afterward.

Lenny (00:10:53):
Fascinating. That's a really good example, and I imagine that helps a lot when the head of growth is encouraging the team not to run as an experiment versus a PM on a subteam, like, "Nah, we don't need to run this as an experiment," because in that case you're already acknowledging that team, "You did a great job, look at this metric. Clearly this one moved. Clearly customers want it." So, to your point, basically this kind of stuff has to come top down probably for it to work well.

Lauryn Isford (00:11:15):
I think it does, and it also cannot be an excuse for rigor around building well and being precise in what customers need, but overall, if you can be a results-oriented organization that just wants to do the right thing and move with urgency, then in my opinion, that's the way that you can have the most impact.

Lenny (00:11:33):
Cool. Okay. I didn't expect to spend that much time on that question, but there's so much there. That was really interesting. What I want to spend the bulk of our time on is onboarding. Something that I found myself, and I think you agree with a lot of this but I'll confirm, is that I've done a lot of research into the growth stories of the most successful startups, and what I find, one, is that retention ends up being the thing you got to crack. If you can't crack retention, nothing else matters. And then, two, more interestingly, onboarding ends up being one of the biggest levers to increasing retention which basically A then B equal C, onboarding ends up being one of the biggest areas of opportunity for growth teams both early on and late stage. And so, I guess the first question, would you agree with that general sentiment that onboarding is this huge opportunity and often undervalued?

Lauryn Isford (00:12:22):
Yes, I definitely agree. It depends of course on the shape of business. Not every business should prioritize onboarding first, but if you have some sort of self-serve element of your product, if someone can give your product a try, maybe you have a playground or a sandbox demo, if there's a premium element to your pricing scheme, if you maybe offer things totally for free and don't even have monetization yet, onboarding is that first really important choke point that from which downstream of onboarding so many important metrics and results flow for the business, from converting someone to a paid customer to closing a deal to growing, how many people in an organization are using your product. So, all of that really comes back to onboarding and if you can get that right, lots of good things will follow.

Lenny (00:13:13):
Okay, great. I'm glad we agreed. I already know this, but you spent a lot of time on Airtable's onboarding flow.

Lauryn Isford (00:13:20):
Yes.

Lenny (00:13:21):
And so, I'm curious just to learn about what did you do over the time that you spent optimizing Airtable's onboarding experience, what kind of impact did you see through the work that you did there, and then just any big kind of general takeaways that either you think people should know or that you'll take with you to future opportunities around optimizing an onboarding experience?

Lauryn Isford (00:13:43):
We could talk about onboarding all day. This is one of my favorite things to chat about recently. So, we did have a wonderful activation team rebuild Airtable's onboarding flow over the past 12 to 18 months. This included many projects, including several big ones. So, what you've probably experienced if you signed up for Airtable recently or what you might experience if you create a new account soon is we've built an immersive wizard that we called Guided Onboarding that helped guide you through setting up your first workflow on Airtable, and in doing that reduced the cognitive load of getting started, helped you make more progress faster, and created scaffolding that more than 90% of customers would benefit from to be able to get up and running on a product that's pretty complicated. That was the first piece.

(00:14:39):
We also then introduced some personalization to use case on top of that. So, instead of helping you build something generic, having you build something that's relevant to you. And then we also worked on ongoing education. So, once you're in a workflow, once you've built something, how do we help you level it up to go from beginner to intermediate to advanced? One funny anecdote about this is that we actually called that project The Mole, M-O-L-E, because the design pattern in product looks like a mole. It pops up from the bottom of the screen and gives you tips as you're exploring. So, those are some of the biggest changes we made. We did retire a bunch of our tooltips which were a big part of onboarding for a really long time. So, happy to chat more about that, and then also did a bunch of more incremental optimizations as well. In general, tried to take a portfolio approach to what we did.

Lenny (00:15:36):
Cool. Okay. A few questions real quick.

Lauryn Isford (00:15:38):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:15:38):
What were the three buckets real quick? So personalization, ongoing education, what was the first one?

Lauryn Isford (00:15:38):
The first one was guided onboarding.

Lenny (00:15:38):
Guided onboarding.

Lauryn Isford (00:15:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:15:46):
What was the impact of this work, just to give people a sense of the kind of impact you can have on conversion and then whatever other metrics you looked at there?

Lauryn Isford (00:15:53):
We were working on activation for a few years before I arrived at Airtable. There was already an awesome activation team, hard at work. Overall, the investments we made in onboarding over about a six to eight month period that included the wizard, The Mole with ongoing education, and also some personalization together drove a 20% lift in activation rate for Airtable.

Lenny (00:16:20):
Wow. That sounds quite impactful, especially at a company at that scale.

Lauryn Isford (00:16:24):
It's awesome. I would say celebrate any clear statistical significant improvement in activation rate. It's a big victory, and credit goes to the team that really spent many, many hours with customers and designing precisely to build something that could have that big of an impact. I think it speaks to the importance of really understanding what a user needs to be onboarded well, which is not the same as what your business wants the user to be onboarded to. So, delineating those and building carefully is really what made it successful.

Lenny (00:16:57):
Which of these three buckets would you say had the biggest impact? Because I want to kind of get a couple levels deeper to get to what exactly did you do that worked really well.

Lauryn Isford (00:17:05):
I would say that the guided onboarding wizard which is the immersive wizard that helps you figure out how to get started was the most impactful thing we did.

Lenny (00:17:14):
And it's interesting that you had tooltips and this feels like a tooltip-y thing. What is it conceptually? What's the simple way to think about the onboarding wizard versus a bunch of tooltips telling you like, "Hey, Lauryn, click here, next go here, and then check this thing out"?

Lauryn Isford (00:17:26):
Totally. Imagine being in a step-by-step guide where you are asked question, for example, pick which kind of project you're working on, pick what kinds of things you'd like to track for this project, and then as you select from beautiful, easy-to-click buttons that require very little work on your part, something is visualized for you on the right half of the screen. So, you can see your workflow visually come to light as you do the work on the left half of the screen, and all of this is done for you in a very guided and instructive way.

Lenny (00:17:59):
Are there any generalized learnings from that experience of just how to do a great onboarding experience? It sounds like probably avoid tooltips, instead just kind of ask questions and show them progress as they're going through it in kind of like an immersive experience versus here's the product, check out all the cool features.

Lauryn Isford (00:18:18):
I think there is something to be said for reducing reliance on tooltips, but I'm not sure I would go so far as to say the tooltip is dead, as much as I maybe would like to because there are too many of them out there. The reason for this is that I do believe Airtable's customers had a very specific need which was that the effort required to build basic scaffolding was too much and they needed more support, guardrails, bumpers to help them through that, and this kind of guided or immersive wizard was the best mechanism we could come up with to reduce that effort required and to make them feel more supported in their journey. I'm not sure that this pattern is one that works for every product. I think it's one that works well for a complicated product, where figuring out where to go next and how to get started is actually very challenging or has a high cognitive load.

(00:19:14):
So, I would keep that in mind, but in this case, it did work really well for us. I have seen some other products in the wild adopt similar patterns which gives me confidence that it is transferrable beyond Airtable and that there's probably something to it. That's definitely a big learning. I think one other big learning for us was that we had to meet users where they are. We have some awesome advanced features of really cool stuff you can do with Airtable, automations being a great example. However, users don't necessarily need to get that started on day one. They don't need to learn about the advanced stuff when they haven't even looked at a workflow before. So, we really worked hard to prioritize what the user actually needed and to consider what was necessary education versus what could be ongoing education and building it up.

Lenny (00:20:06):
Can you talk a bit more about what that was? What did you actually do to understand the type of user, and then what did you change for them? Because we actually did something like this at Airbnb, and it was a tiny bit successful for host onboarding but it wasn't anything big. And so, I'm curious what it is you specifically did. Did you ask them a few questions and then grouped them in a group and then changed the way the rest of the flow went, or, yeah, what'd you do there?

Lauryn Isford (00:20:31):
Good question. So, at the very, very beginning, we sort of said new users broadly need help. Who are they? What do we know about them? How can we help them? We spoke to a bunch of customers and also watched them get started and looked for patterns in behavior and also clusters. So, someone who is familiar with databases, somewhat technical and prefers to and has experience in building things might have a different need from onboarding than someone who is exploring a tool that was recommended to them for a project minute. With that in mind, there were some clear segments of personas or buckets of users that we could split out to give different experiences. Now that said, when we rolled out the guided onboarding wizard, it was actually just one generic onboarding that was one-size-fits-all, and while escape patches are great, we felt like we could solve, as I think I referenced earlier, more than 90% of use cases or users needs with one generic onboarding to start and then we could personalize from there.

(00:21:34):
When we started to personalize, generally we found bucketing customers by their learning style and their building style was more effective than more classic segmentation, like do you work in marketing, do you work in product management, do you work in operation. The reason for this is that there are many different types of building or workflows that are possible in Airtable. Some are sophisticated for use at work, some are simple for use at work, some are somewhere in between and are for a hobby use case or a consulting use case. Knowing how someone would go about building was more effective than what do you actually want to see on the other side.

(00:22:19):
This means that something like a template which can give you an example of how to build a use case for project management can be helpful for inspiration but might not actually be the best way to teach you how to use a product like Airtable, when instead, we could learn that you're someone who needs more familiarity with databases to be able to get to the next level, or who might need a more visual learning experience instead of a more data-forward learning experience. So, we tried to segment the experience that way and found that that yielded better results on activation than some of the more traditional segments.

Lenny (00:22:52):
And how did you decide which segment that a user was in? Was it a question you asked them right at the beginning?

Lauryn Isford (00:22:57):
We had a really awesome research team that would do some surveys and conversations with customers away from our production experience and away from individual projects. So, we had a really robust read going in to the project of who these different personas were, different building types, different learning types. That said, we do also ask folks when they sign up some questions and depending on who you are or what we might think we know about you or want to know about you, we might ask you different questions and that's in service of helping you get started.

(00:23:27):
I had some big ideas for how we might bring this to life even further that might come to life in the future, such as if somebody's there to just help out, if they're may be a teammate rather than a builder, if they're just there to work with someone else because Lenny invited Lauryn to work on her table because he needed Lauryn to do something or update a sprint, whatever. Lauryn needs really different onboarding than Lenny. So, actually getting that data in the flow is really useful because then we can route customers to a fully different experience. It's amazing how much low-hanging fruit there is to personalize and segment that onboarding experience in so many products that are out there. You just need to be really detail-oriented and precise on who you're working with.

Lenny (00:24:11):
You talked about this experience as activation, and so just digging a little bit further into that idea. One of the important kind of metrics, milestones you got to figure out when you're working on onboarding is what is an activated user, what's the activation milestone, what's the activation metric. I know you have some strong opinions and some really interesting insights into activation milestones based on your experience at Airtable. Can you chat a bit about that and just share what Airtable's activation metric ended up being?

Lauryn Isford (00:24:37):
Yes. So, overall, every growth team needs a north star metric. It's so important to have singular focus on what the business results are that you are working to drive in your team. On our activation team, which as I mentioned focused on onboarding, though in theory there could be other ways that you want to focus on driving activation, we had one north star metric which was what we called our team activation metric. So, this representative, a team of people were activated on Airtable's product and using it in a way that suggested they would be long-term retained. For us, that was week four, multi-user, meaning in the fourth week, more than one person on that team is active and contributing to a workflow on Airtable.

(00:25:23):
This metric is something that our wonderful analytics team determined to be highly correlated with long-term retention. It's also a metric that holds a relatively high bar, so it requires a number of things to be true, that something of substance has been built, that people persist and continue to collaborate, that they're collaborating on a weekly cadence, and also holds a relatively high bar on exactly how they're contributing, meaning that the sum total of this is somewhat hard to achieve which means that we have a hard job and also a high bar as an activation team to achieve that for as many customers as possible.

(00:25:58):
In general, I think an activation rate that falls in a lower percentage range, maybe for most companies five to 15%, is better than one that falls in a higher percentage range because it means that there's likely much higher correlation with long-term retention and you're really working hard to get most of your users to reach a state that they're not reaching today.

Lenny (00:26:22):
I really like that heuristic. So, the idea there is when you're picking an activation metric, you want it to be in the single digits potentially because you're saying that's more likely to be correlated with retention because retention's probably pretty low long term. Is that kind of the rough idea?

Lauryn Isford (00:26:38):
That's a rough idea. Of course, the metric should be correlated with retention no matter what, but if 40% of your customers are still active at week four maybe with a metric that would be week four active rate, then only a fraction of those are still going to be active in month 12, in month 18, and month 24, and I would much prefer to pick a more specific, more precise metric that maybe only 5% of users reach, but know that those 5% of users will be with us for the long haul, and if we could get that 5% even to 6% or 7%, it would have huge downstream effects on long-term metrics for the business. So, that's why I would opt for a more specific metric.

Lenny (00:27:22):
Okay. So, this activation metric, week four multi-user active is a really interesting metric. Can you talk a bit about how you actually operationalize this and put this to work on your team to help people understand what to work on and make sure they're moving the right sorts of numbers?

Lauryn Isford (00:27:39):
Totally. So, one of the first things that we did when me and my team started to revisit week four multi-user active right before we started to rebuild onboarding is break that metric down into all of its component. So, if you really think about what goes into that number, how many teams sign up as a team versus as an individual, how many of them make it to week four, how many of them have more than two people invited versus more than two people who've ever been active, versus more than two people who were active in the fourth week, maybe they have one person active in the fourth week, and then what does active mean, and what are the different kinds of behaviors that constitute contribution or being active. Doing that really detailed work on the metric helped us understand what levers we could pull to have a really big impact on activation overall.

(00:28:34):
Additionally, we actually started using more metrics. So, we didn't just use our activation rate metric week four multi-user active to make all of our decisions. We introduced a few more, and one of them with purely a retention metric for an individual. Are you week two retained? Are you week four retained? The other was what we called Build with a capital B, and this was roughly a sophistication score. So, for someone who's building something, have they reached sort of intermediate levels of use of Airtable? The reason why we added these metrics is we were building new mechanisms for onboarding that were helping users build more effectively and find more value in Airtable, but sometimes those treatments helped users become more sophisticated but didn't help them invite more teammates, or sometimes those new mechanisms made someone more interested in giving us a shot for a few more weeks, but what they built was actually not any more impressive than if they had done it on their own.

(00:29:38):
So, this group of metrics actually really set us free. It gave us those constraints where we could actually measure success in a few different ways and think about activation as being more complicated than just a single metric and celebrate anything we could do to help on a couple of dimensions. So, I know it's a little unconventional to have a few metrics that you work with, but we did find that that was really helpful when we were making big changes.

Lenny (00:30:04):
That is actually really interesting. So, it makes it feel like the core activation metric you talked about was more of an output metric and you kind of realized here's the things we could actually be moving directly. Is that roughly how you thought about it?

Lauryn Isford (00:30:15):
Exactly. It also helped us grapple with some of the tensions we felt which I know a lot of teams working on activation and onboarding feel, which is picking one metric doesn't paint the whole picture of what you're trying to achieve when you help a user onboard to your product and when you educate them about what's possible. So, in having sophistication and retention and an element of team use all as part of the fabric of how we talked about activation, it made us much more well-rounded as a team.

Lenny (00:30:46):
That connects a bit to, so we worked on this post together about how to choose an activation metric and you shared part of this story for that post, and there's a little bit of a debate amongst folks that contributed their opinion on how to decide an activation metric, where it's a debate between is it okay to have a workspace activation metric where it's like how many boards somebody creates, how many Airtables somebody has created versus a user action, like user has created 10 tables or user using it two times a week. I think you're on the side of workspace is maybe a more interesting metric for a collaboration tool, and it's interesting that you end up with both in the end which I think is kind of where folks landed. You probably look at how's the company using this tool and then per user, are they using it consistently. So, I guess the question is just what's your take on user specific activation metric versus workspace level activation metric?

Lauryn Isford (00:31:39):
I really like this question. I agree it is a great debate. I'm not sure there's a clear answer because it does depend on your product. In the case of Airtable, which is a product that has seat-based pricing and generally horizontal adoption, it totally makes sense to have a workspace activation measure because you want to understand in an account, in an organization how many folks are actually using a product and finding value. That can be different for tools that might look like Airtable but have different mechanisms for growth or different pricing or different vertical personas that tend to adopt it. So, I do think there is some variance. I do have a reaction to share with you that's a little spicy-

Lenny (00:32:19):
Please.

Lauryn Isford (00:32:20):
... is that it's important that growth teams are agile and this means that north stars, key metrics, focus metrics will change, and if you're working on the same metric forever, there's probably some inefficiency in actually chasing the biggest impact for the business. So, I would be open-minded about if a workspace or team or account activation metric is always the right thing to focus on. Team activation looks really healthy because your growth team did some really amazing work on it, maybe user retention is the right place to focus next year. Maybe it's more about conversion. Maybe it's more about some other signal for long-term retention, and I would be open to being dynamic and changing that metric over time. Stability in metric is great, it helps with momentum, it helps with building expertise, but sometimes we overfocus on picking the perfect north star metric and by the time you feel like you've found the perfect one, it's actually time to move on to something different and work on a different opportunity.

Lenny (00:33:24):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and then set you to north star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments, and Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:34:34):
Is there an example of that that comes to mind when you talk about being a little stuck on a metric? Is that something you went through at Airtable or anywhere else you worked?

Lauryn Isford (00:34:43):
I've gone through it plenty of times. We actually at the organizational level on the Airtable growth award changed our north star metric a couple times which is a big deal that manifests for several teams. Roughly the arc of that change for us was shifting from being a growth org focused on revenue to a growth organization focused on user growth and customer growth. This for us was a really important moment where we decided that it was most essential in our work to grow the business to bring millions more people onto the platform, using the product and finding value in the product, because we were taking a decade's long view that they could always become monetized or converted customers later, and there wasn't really a rush. We felt that focusing on revenue led us to make some decisions that were a bit more short-term oriented than would be ideal.

(00:35:39):
There's also a dynamic here where in the world of enterprise SaaS, the world of B2B SaaS, there's a new theme called product-led sales that's very hot right now, and this means that often in a PLG company there's some ideal end goal of handing off certain customers to have a sales conversation or to close an enterprise contract. In that case, you might actually prefer to delay revenue for months or quarters or years to manifest it later, and when that's the case, your growth team should be fully aligned in lockstep with sales and with go-to-market team and focusing on user growth is actually the right call. So, that's an example of a big pivot that we made, and in doing that, we felt more strategic clarity and were able to move faster.

Lenny (00:36:25):
That is an awesome story. How long did that process take and any advice for folks that might be going through a similar journey of maybe we should rethink our north star metric not and not be revenue? Any advice there?

Lauryn Isford (00:36:36):
In general, I would say having stability in north star metric for at least six months feels like table stakes to me and that's for the reasons that I cited before, for building momentum, for building domain expertise, and also for compounding impact in areas where you see success, where you notice growth flywheels that you can optimize. However, if you're reaching a point where that north star metric feels like it's old news, maybe you're outgrowing it, maybe you want to work on different things, I think that's great. Be open-minded about changing it up. I would generally try to start with the mechanics of the business and what you think you might be able to drive in terms of metric impact with the resources you have on your growth team. That can look different for every growth team because some of them have marketing, some are more product and engineering, some are kind of a mix of both or even something different than that.

(00:37:27):
So, I would start with what impact do we think we could have? Where do we think the biggest opportunity is to chase? You can literally draw a funnel on a whiteboard and map it out and brainstorm together, do some analysis on the side, and when you see what opportunity feels like the most important thing to chase, try to build a north star metric that reflects the output of that work, rather than drives all of your decision-making from the beginning. A north star metric should really be a measure of what you plan to do, the strategy you plan to deliver is delivering results for the business on the other side, rather than the other way around.

Lenny (00:38:05):
So, you mentioned trials and freemium at one point and I want to spend a little time on this, and I know you also have some strong opinions about this kind of debate. Another debate people have, there's always debates in growth, between offering a trial or offering a freemium product, self-serve, and I think your perspective is you should do both, and I think maybe you call it a reverse trial because I was doing some research. So, I guess is that true?, Is that how you see the world, and then just generally, why do you believe that that is the right approach?

Lauryn Isford (00:38:31):
What is it about all these growth people with their strong opinion?

Lenny (00:38:34):
Right?

Lauryn Isford (00:38:35):
I guess I have so many of them. You're educating me on my own perspectives today. Freemium and free trials. So, to get on the same page with definitions for all of our wonderful listeners, a free trial is when you can use the product for free for a limited time and then your only option beyond that limited time is to pay for use of the product. Freemium would be when there are multiple options for how to use the product and one of those options is an infinitely free version of the product. So, you can use Airtable for free forever or you can pay some amount and have access to premium features.

(00:39:14):
So, with all that in mind, personally I'm in the camp of offering a reverse trial. Funky name, but what that means is offer a trial but also offer freemium. Do both. The reason why I like this is you get an opportunity when somebody shows up and says, "Hey, I'm going to give your product a try today," to show them everything that's possible. Onboarding is a huge component of that. Help somebody get started, have those aha moments and experience initial value, but also this is your moment to showcase everything that can be done with your really cool product, and you have some limited number of days, maybe seven days, 14 days, 30 days, to showcase all of the cool things that your company is building for your customers. That is the beauty of a free trial. It's not just that someone can try your product without paying. It's that they can try even more of the product, all of the premium, amazing advanced offerings that could be possible if they decide they want to settle on a premium plan.

(00:40:17):
When you are deciding if this is something you want to do, I would actually take a big step back from looking at competitive pricing pages and getting into the details and reading blogs and just think about what your philosophy is as a business on monetizing customers. The reason for this is generally the reason to offer a free plan or a free trial but really a free plan, the freemium type of pricing model is if you value letting millions, tens of millions of customers give your product a try, even if they never pay you a dollar. That shows to me prioritization and value of user grab, brand awareness, and exposure of your product more than just revenue. And if that's the case, a freemium pricing structure can be really great for your product, and it give you the space to see if your product can become that household name that everybody is familiar with and can give a try and get some early value and even experience some aha moments.

(00:41:24):
On top of that, you can offer a free trial to show what's possible with premium value and then that really can just be focused space for you to say, "Hey, look what's possible if you pay us $5 a month, $10 a month," and you might even get some extra conversion out of that and some more paid customers. So, in general, that's how I think about it. I like the reverse trial because user growth is important and if you're in a long game where you're trying to grow a business for a decade or more, ideally you're trying to get millions of people onto your product and you can always have that monetization conversation later, but you only get a couple moments where you can say, "Hey, pull out your credit card or let's get on the phone and talk about an enterprise contract," with a customer before you lose trust or lose patience. And so, that focus on helping them discover value and build loyalty to you is much more important.

Lenny (00:42:13):
I really like this concept, a super cool name too. I'm also thinking back to some of the SaaS tools I've used that have had this where I go straight into the pro plan and then I'm like, "Oh, I don't want to lose all these features," and then I actually end up buying it. So, when I'm hearing this, it sounds to me like it's a better version of the freemium approach. I imagine there's still many SaaS tools that are very enterprise-y, take handholding, maybe this goes away. I know Elena Verna who's been on the podcast is just a huge proponent of everyone will be product-led, self-serve eventually, but until that day they're still like, I don't know, I think of Retool I think is very hands-on, handhold-y, front I think is like that. There's all these tools that people don't get really quickly.

(00:42:57):
And so, I guess do you still think there's a need for some of these tools that need sales and customer success involvement to stick with just trial at least for now, or do you think they should all kind of find a way to get to self-serve and a reverse trial?

Lauryn Isford (00:43:12):
I do really agree with what Elena said. I really look forward to the day when self-serve and freemium are possible for every product, but I also recognize that that can be really expensive to build and implement and is not for everyone. So, that's cool too. There are other options. In general, I think freemium and also free trials tend to be most effective when there's something that the person who signed up can actually do on their own without being handheld. It doesn't have to be full functionality. It can be exploring a sandbox or a demo or something they can poke around in and experience value, see that aha moment. That's great. That's a moment where you can give value to that person who's chosen to spend time with your product. If that's not possible, there are different ways to be creative that don't require having premium pricing. You can think about how to use concepts related to PLG and related to top of funnel adoption in different ways.

(00:44:16):
So, maybe you can create custom landing pages or experiences that help showcase value without a full signup or free plan or free trial experience. Maybe you give folks the ability to sign up and while they've sort of signed up as an interested customer, they're not fully experiencing things, they might not even have the option to pay for something yet, but they can learn. There's some resources. There's some education for them to experience. Or, maybe you can think about top of funnel adoption or traffic as being most helpful for extension within customers you already. So, if you've signed contracts with a couple really large Fortune 500 companies and somebody wants to join and signs up on your website from the same email domain, then you can provide an experience for them that might feel like it helps them learn the mechanics that's actually only available to folks who are part of organizations that already have contracts with you.

(00:45:19):
It's a different way of thinking about PLG and not necessarily something you would offer for free, they're already an enterprise customer, but some of those concepts can still have a lot of value and help you grow the footprint of an account in an organization, and those are definitely awesome things to try if you can't offer something self-serve.

Lenny (00:45:36):
So, what I'm hearing is find ways to make things some component of it self-serve so that you don't need to necessarily talk to someone immediately. They can start to understand some element of it on maybe an interactive planning page or some very simple part of the product.

Lauryn Isford (00:45:50):
Exactly. I think the key is to figure out what it would be like for someone to experience value when there's no human sitting next to them, and that value doesn't have to be full functionality of the product.

Lenny (00:46:02):
Awesome. Coming back to onboarding, and this is my last onboarding question, I have another topic I wanted to touch on. Do you have any just general pieces of advice, either probably this will work if you're working on onboarding/things that probably won't work and are common traps that people fall into when they're trying to optimize onboarding activation flows in general?

Lauryn Isford (00:46:26):
I do see a very common trap that I would love to caution against, which is that employees of a company build onboarding for customers, but they build what they think customers want rather than what customers actually want, and that manifests in an onboarding experience that's not very helpful. So, there are two patterns that I typically see. One is naming features. So, imagine you're using Airtable for the first time and you see a tooltip and it says, "This is automations," and it explains what automations is to you. That's not that useful for a user who doesn't really know what's going on yet because they aren't sure if automations are relevant to them, if they're suited to their use case, what exactly the word automation entails. We've named a feature, but it's really sort of an announcement of something awesome that Airtable built, rather than an application that can help educate the user on how they'll receive more value from that feature. Try not to name features. It can be very tempting in practice, even though it sounds easy in theory.

Lenny (00:47:32):
Before you move on, what have you learned about how to actually name things in such a way people understand? Is there some you do there?

Lauryn Isford (00:47:39):
Ooh, naming things in a way people understand.

Lenny (00:47:41):
Versus the feature name, like you just said.

Lauryn Isford (00:47:43):
So, instead of that, I think what would be more useful, given the constraints of using a tooltip that's pushing someone to try an automation would be to explain how the automation is relevant to them, or even better, to enable a one-touch turn-on of the automation feature or set up an automation to complete your workflow where we actually do some of the work and if you click into here, we will show you what value is possible and help you get it to the finish line. So, really focusing on that contextual application or helping to drive towards an outcome, rather than just educating on a name.

Lenny (00:48:23):
And there's an element of smart defaulting, just like starting to do it for them versus do you want this or not.

Lauryn Isford (00:48:29):
Exactly. There's also an element here of segmentation or personalization where you should be sensible about if everybody needs to know what an automation is or if there are only certain folks who actually need to learn about it and others might not need to know.

Lenny (00:48:42):
Awesome. All right. Back to your other suggestions.

Lauryn Isford (00:48:46):
Oh yes, there is one other suggestion which is if you're working on a SaaS product, especially a freemium product, there's probably some pricing and packaging scheme that explains which features are available for free, which features are not, how many you get, and sort of maps out usage of the product, both for free users if you offer a free plan, and then for premium users if you offer premium plans. I find sometimes teams working on onboarding will map onboarding to that pricing or packaging. So, for example, maybe automations, to use the same example of the same feature, is something that's generally premium, that if somebody uses automations they're more likely to be a paying customer. It can be tempting then for an onboarding team to try to push automations to people when they're getting started because of course, we'd prefer if customers use premium features because then they might be more likely to become premium customers, but that is not in the best interest of educating a user on how to get started.

(00:49:44):
So, I do think it's very important to be careful that you are rooted in the customer need and rooted in helping that customer achieve maximum value, rather than sitting in the priors of what your packaging scheme might suggest or what might be in the best interest of the company.

Lenny (00:50:02):
As a growth leader, how do you operationalize that? Is it set some drag metrics? Is it just philosophically, let's make sure we're optimizing the right metric? What's worked to actually avoid that problem?

Lauryn Isford (00:50:15):
I think north star metrics help because a team can be singularly focused on the most important result for their roadmap and their charter. However, guardrail metrics are equally important. So, an onboarding team that builds amazing onboarding that causes a 10% drop in revenue would need some sort of guardrails to make sure that they knew that that might not be the right trade for the business, and importantly, should have the rigor and passion to go deep and understand what caused that drop in revenue and figure out what it was about that onboarding that ultimately caused a guardrail metric to suffer. So, with that in mind, I think guardrail metrics can be very useful and are important to choose wisely. I love working with strong analytics partners on a growth team because rigor and education around how to think about guardrail metrics is something that we should always be thinking about, whether you are a data analyst in functional specialty or a PM or an engineer or a designer.

(00:51:19):
So, that's how I kind of like to think about it. I do think guardrail metrics help and then just being well reasoned and thinking about what's best for the business and speaking about your work as being what's best for the business and the customer overall, rather than being too narrow in your own swim lanes of what you work on.

Lenny (00:51:35):
Great advice. I want to shift to a different topic and this will be much shorter. You have this really cool framework for thinking about the PLG funnel, product-led growth, and interestingly kind of trickles down to the team you build, metrics you choose, and things like that. So, can you just briefly talk about just this framework that you use to think about PLG growth in the PLG funnel?

Lauryn Isford (00:51:55):
When I think about how to grow with PLG in a business that has some element of PLG, self-server, freemium, I usually start with a funnel that roughly maps to the same scaffolding, regardless of business. Whether I've worked on the business, whether I'm supporting the business as an advisor, I love starting with this framework. The first step is join, the second is evaluate, the third is upgrade, and the fourth is expand. This funnel represents the journey of a customer in a PLG product as they advance and develop in their lifetime of using the product. It starts with becoming a part of the account that's using the product or signing up, and you might join because you found Airtable on Twitter or you might join because Lenny invited you to use Airtable. So, there are different ways that you can join that product in the first place.

(00:52:55):
Then importantly, you evaluate if it's right for you, and that word choice of evaluate is deliberately not onboard or activate because it's about what the user needs to see that they are going to get the value that they want in using your product and in building a habit around it. Next is upgrade. Ideally, someone has gone from beginner to intermediate or even advanced in their ongoing education and in getting to know your product over some amount of time and they see premium value and raise their hand and say, "I will convert to it." Now if you offer self-serve premium plans, that's awesome. They can do it with a credit card right in the product. Sometimes this means raising their hand to talk to sales and that's great too, but they upgrade to some sort of premium experience or to more value than what they have when they got started.

(00:53:43):
And finally expand, and vertical says this can be nuanced but with more horizontal tools. Ideally, a few folks, maybe one, maybe a few are using a tool in an organization and then many more adopt it over time, and that expansion drives net dollar retention, it drives brand awareness, it drives more usage in more pockets of the company, it is awesome for renewal rates if you're working with enterprise contracts, and ultimately then also brings new referrals into the product that loop all the way back to the beginning at join.

Lenny (00:54:19):
I love it. And what's cool is upgrade and expansion kind of bake in retention. You're not going to upgrade, you're not going to expand if you're not retained. Can you talk a little bit about how you use this framework? Do you bucket? Do you have these four teams on your growth team that focus on each of these stages? Is it more of a conceptual framework? Do you come up with KPIs for each of these steps? How do you actually operationalize this concept?

Lauryn Isford (00:54:40):
I think this framework is a step to abstract to represent exactly how you should structure your teams or to be represented with four metrics, for KPIs. However, it's a really good conceptual way of grounding your team or your organization in the mechanics of how machine that is the business you work on run. From there, it can become much easier to communicate with each other on where you see opportunity on specific pockets of the product that might be impactful. So, for example, you might be working on a strategy related to landing pages and be able to name that that's going to help drive joins in new organization, and that's a really awesome way to communicate why you might invest there versus investing in something related to onboarding that would help with evaluate.

(00:55:32):
So, I love this framework because it helps everyone communicate clearly and also you can derive from it more specifically what are the opportunities that are relevant to us with this framework in mind, and then revisit it over time to gut check if you feel like maybe what you're investing in now is a bit outdated and needs a refresh, or if there are other pockets of the business that need more attention that you might be able to work.

Lenny (00:55:58):
Can you talk a bit about how you structured the growth team potentially based on this framework and just generally how you thought about building the growth team at Airtable?

Lauryn Isford (00:56:06):
We had what I think is a pretty relevant set of teams. If you're thinking about building out a few in your own product or organization that focuses on sort of a PLG shape of business, we had one team working on acquisition and they were really responsible for the join. So, they mapped actually really well to this funnel. One team working on activation and they mapped pretty closely to evaluate. It wasn't a full representation of what's possible in evaluate. We were pretty focused on the self-serve business and that was different than, for example, helping an enterprise customer evaluate the right offering for them, but that activation team was most closely tied to that second step in the funnel.

(00:56:50):
And then we had a monetization team that worked on monetization and pricing and they mapped really closely to the upgrade part of the funnel. They did touch some other things as well. So, they worked on churn prevention and downgrades. They worked on some billing related projects, but in general, they were most thematically aligned with that upgrade step of the funnel. One area that is more emerging that's interesting is expand. So, when we got started on Airtable growth, we didn't have a team dedicated to that expand piece and it became increasingly interesting to us over time as we started to notice that larger companies were using the product. This meant that there was a bigger opportunity than there had been before to really help drive expansion and get more folks using the product in those accounts. That's an area that emerged later. That's a really good example of revisiting your priors and being resilient or agile in your org structure because it wasn't something we set out to work on initially, but it became a really clear opportunity later.

Lenny (00:57:53):
You mentioned that Airtable is thinking a little bit more about B2B growth versus just kind of B2C where I think it's been historically. Can you talk about that and just how you're thinking about that?

Lauryn Isford (00:58:04):
B2B growth is an emerging space for growth practitioners and hobbyists like me because the playbook hasn't been written the same way that B2C growth or consumer social growth has been. It's a new space, and there are quite a few companies that are really excited about exploring B2B growth and how to apply the DNA and the mechanics of a growth organization to more of that B2B motion or to working with more upmarket customers or enterprise customers. So, it's very top of mind for me. It's a active conversation in the growth community, especially in San Francisco. Overall, I'm really excited to see what we can do by applying this approach to growing businesses, to new types of businesses. It will require some differences in execution model. So, in B2C or in consumer social as two examples, you can experiment at large volumes or you can make changes that impact thousands or millions of people pretty easily.

(00:59:15):
In B2B growth, generally you're working with a much smaller set of customers and also the risk profile can be very different because smaller numbers of customers that represent larger percentages of your company's total revenue must be treated with absolute care, as opposed to a world where you might have millions of folks coming through your product every day and small changes might not have as big of an impact. In an enterprise organization, it's important to be very careful and rigorous and to prioritize that customer's needs all the time. This means that rigor, that customer conversations, that beta testing, that live prototypes and demos are significantly more important and that face time with the customer is significantly more important than it is in B2C growth. So, we'll see what happens. I'm really excited to see more folks who have given growth a try in B2C or in consumer spaces try applying it to B2B because it will become increasingly common in the industry.

Lenny (01:00:19):
Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. I'll go through it pretty fast. Are you ready?

Lauryn Isford (01:00:27):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:00:28):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Lauryn Isford (01:00:34):
Ride of a Lifetime by Bob Iger. I give this to new reports on my team. Great book to read when you're thinking about your leadership style, and Rocket Men, really fun story. I love a good story about ambition and achieving awesome things.

Lenny (01:00:50):
What's a favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Lauryn Isford (01:00:54):
I like Fifth & Mission which is a local San Francisco podcast on local politics.

Lenny (01:01:01):
Favorite recent movie or TV show that you have watched that you've really enjoyed?

Lauryn Isford (01:01:05):
I really like the White Lotus Season 2. White Lotus was very fun to watch. I also, on the movie front, I'm in a habit of watching Best Picture nominees every year and last year there were a couple movies I really enjoyed, one of them was Belfast.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Oh man, that was an intense movie. I watched that recently. And also, if we should turn this into a drinking game, every time someone mentions White Lotus, we drink. It's an amazing show, but it's definitely comes up often. So interesting.

Lauryn Isford (01:01:35):
Comes up too much.

Lenny (01:01:37):
It deserves to come up often. I love it.

Lauryn Isford (01:01:39):
That's true.

Lenny (01:01:41):
It's great, but that'd be okay. We're going to do a drinking game from now on and I'll have a shot here. Love White Lotus. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people?

Lauryn Isford (01:01:50):
Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful.

Lenny (01:01:58):
What do you look for in an answer when you ask that question? What's your kind of a good sign and what's maybe a bad sign?

Lauryn Isford (01:02:02):
I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.

Lenny (01:02:19):
Hear, hear. What are five SaaS products that you use day to day, and you can't say Airtable?

Lauryn Isford (01:02:25):
Figma, Miro, Slack, Gmail, and my fifth one, I need to think about it.

Lenny (01:02:36):
It's because I cut out Airtable. I got you.

Lauryn Isford (01:02:39):
I know, I always say Airtable. Airtable's definitely number five.

Lenny (01:02:42):
Okay. Probably number one. Okay, final question. Speaking of Airtable, what's the coolest use of Airtable you've seen?

Lauryn Isford (01:02:48):
There was a great embedded view, which is the internal term for when you put Airtable on your website in an embedded way so people can check out cool stuff, related to finding COVID vaccine when they came out, which was really awesome. I also appreciated that a similar use of Airtable has become quite popular this year in support of facilitating folks who've been laid off to help them find new opportunities.

Lenny (01:03:15):
Lauryn, this was amazing. I learned a ton. We got through everything I was hoping to get through which I did not expect. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and to reach out to you, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Lauryn Isford (01:03:28):
You all can find me on Twitter. I'm @laurynisford. I love hearing about how folks with all different kinds of cool products are thinking about growth. In general, I find all of us are better at growing businesses when we study the awesome wins and learnings of others. So, please, my DMs are open. Send me cool things you're working on. I'd love to learn about it.

Lenny (01:03:51):
Amazing. Lauryn, thank you. Let's go drive some growth.

Lauryn Isford (01:03:54):
All right.

## Transcript

Logan Kilpatrick (00:00:00):
Finding people who are high agency and work with urgency, if I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to get 50 people's different consensus. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having, and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that... People just go and do it and solve the problem, and I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Today my guest is Logan Kilpatrick. Logan is head of developer relations at OpenAI, where he supports developers building on open AI's, APIs and ChatGPT. Before OpenAI, Logan was a machine learning engineer at Apple and advised NASA on their open source policy. If you can believe it, ChatGPT launched just over a year ago and transformed the way that we think about AI and what it means for our products and our lives. Logan has been at the front lines of this change, and every day is helping developers and companies figure out how to leverage these new AI superpowers.

(00:01:10):
In our conversation, we dig into examples of how people are using ChatGPT and the new GPTs and other open AI APIs in their work and their life. Logan shares some really interesting advice on how to get better at prompt engineering. We also get into how OpenAI operates internally, how they ship so quickly, and the two key attributes they look for in the people that they hire, plus, where Logan sees the biggest opportunities for new products and new startups building on their APIs.

(00:01:38):
We also get a little bit into the very dramatic weekend that OpenAI had with the board and Sam Altman and all of that, and so much more. A huge thank you to Dan Shipper and Dennis Ing for some great questions, suggestions. With that, I bring you Logan Kilpatrick after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:56):
This episode is brought to you by Hex. If you're a data person, you probably have to jump between different tools to run queries, build visualizations, write Python, and send around a lot of screenshots and CSV files.

(00:03:52):
Logan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:03:55):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:03:57):
I want to start with the elephant in the room, which I think the elephant is actually leaving the room because I think this is months ago at this point, but I'm still just really curious. What was it like on the inside of OpenAI during the very dramatic weekend with the board and Sam and all those things? What was it like? And is there a story maybe you could share that maybe people haven't heard about what it was like on the inside, what was going on?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:04:20):
Yeah, it was definitely a very stressful Thanksgiving week. I think in broad context, OpenAI had been pushing for a really long time, since ChatGPT came out, and that was supposed to be one of the first weeks that the whole company had taken time away to actually reset and have a break. So very selfishly, I was super excited to spend time with my family, all that stuff. And then, yeah, Friday afternoon we got the message that all of the changes were happening, and I think it was super shocking because I think, and this is a perspective a lot of folks share, everybody had and continues to have such deep trust in Sam and Greg and our leadership team that it was just very surprising. And we're also a very, as far as company cultures go, very transparent and very open. So when there's problems or there's things going on, we tend to hear about them. And again, it was the first time that a lot of us had heard some of the things that were happening between the board and the leadership team, so very, very surprising.

(00:05:20):
I think my being someone who's not based in San Francisco, I was, again, very selfishly kind of happy that it happened over the Thanksgiving break because a lot of folks actually had gone home to different places. So it felt like I had a little bit of comfort knowing I wasn't the only one not in San Francisco, because everybody was meeting up in person to do a bunch of stuff and be together during that time. So it was nice to know that there was a few other folks who were sort of out of the loop with me.

(00:05:51):
I think the thing that surprised me the most was just how quickly everybody got back to business. I flew to San Francisco the next week after Thanksgiving, which I wasn't planning to do, to deal with the team in person and seeing, literally Monday morning, I was walking into the office being, like expecting, I don't know, something weird to be going on or happening. And really it was like people laser focused and back to work, and I think that speaks to the caliber of our team and everybody who's just so excited about building towards the mission that we're building towards. So I think that was, yeah, that was the most surprising thing of the whole incident. I think a lot of companies would've had the potential to truly be derailed for some non-trivial amount of time by this, and everybody was just right back to it, which I love.

Lenny (00:06:40):
I feel like it also maybe brought the team closer together. It feels like it was this kind of traumatic experience that may bring folks together because it was something they all shared. Is there anything along those lines that's like, "Wow, things are a little different now?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:06:52):
One of my takeaways was I'm actually very grateful that this happened when it happened. I think today the stakes are... They're still relatively high. People have built their businesses on top of OpenAI. We have tons of customers who love ChatGPT, so if something bad happens to us, we definitely impact our customers. But on the world scale, somebody else will build a model if OpenAI disappeared and continue towards this progress of general intelligence. I think fast-forward five or 10 years, if something like this would've happened and we hadn't gone through the hopeful upcoming work transformation and all those changes that are going to happen, I think it would've been a little bit, or potentially much worse, of an outcome. So I'm glad that things happened when the stakes are a little bit lower.

(00:07:39):
And I totally agree with you. It's like the team has been growing so rapidly over the last year since I joined. It's been crazy to think about how many new folks there are, and I really think that this really brought people together because most folks, historically, many of the folks when I joined, what kind of banded us all together was the launch of ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-4, and for folks who weren't around for some of those launches, it was perhaps step day. For folks who are on for dev day, it was probably this event. So I think we've had these events that have really brought the company together cross-functionally, so hopefully all the future ones will be really exciting things like GPT five, whenever that comes, and stuff like that.

Lenny (00:08:20):
Awesome. We're going to talk about GPT-5. Going in a totally different direction, what is the most mind-blowing or surprising thing that you've seen AI do recently?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:08:31):
The things that are getting me most excited are these new interfaces around AI, like the Rabbit R-1. I don't know if you've seen that, but consumer hardware device, this company called TL Draw. I don't know if you've seen TL Draw.

Lenny (00:08:44):
I think. You sketch something and then it makes it as a website?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:08:48):
And that's only a small piece of what TL Draw is actually working on, but there's all of these new interfaces to interact with AI, and I think I was having a conversation with the TL Draw folks a couple of days ago, really blows my mind to think about how chat is the predominant way that folks are using AI today. And I actually think, and this is my bulk case for the folks at TL Draw, I'm super excited for them to build what they're building, but they're sort of building this infinite canvas experience and you can imagine how, as you're interacting with an AI on a daily basis, you might want to jump over to your infinite canvas, which the AI has filled in all the details and you might see a reference to a file and to a video and all of these different things.

(00:09:30):
And it's such a cool way. It actually makes a lot more sense for us as humans to see stuff in that type of format than, I think, just listing out a bunch of stuff in chat. So I'm really, really excited to see more people. I think 2024 is the year of multimodal AI, but it's also the year that people really push the boundaries of some of these new UX paradigms around AI.

Lenny (00:09:53):
It's funny. I feel like Chatbots, as a PM for many years, it feels like every brainstorming session we had about new features, it's like, "Hey, we should have built a Chatbot to solve this problem." It's like the perennial like, "Oh, Chatbot," or, "Someone's going to suggest we do a Chatbot," and now they're actually useful and working and everyone's building Chatbots, a lot of them based on OpenAI APIs.

(00:10:12):
There's not really a question there, but maybe the question, I was going to get to this later, is just when people are thinking about building a product like, say, TL Draw, what should they think about? Where OpenAI is not going to go versus here's what OpenAI is going to do for us. We shouldn't worry about them building a version of TL Draw in the future. What's the way to think about where you won't be disrupted essentially by OpenAI, knowing also they may change their mind?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:10:36):
That's a great question. I think we're deeply focused on these very, very general use cases like the general reasoning capabilities, the general coding, the general writing abilities. I think where you start to get into some of these very vertical applications... And I think a great example of this is actually Harvey. I don't know if you've seen Harvey, but it's this legal AI use case where they're building custom models and tools to help lawyers and people at legal firms and stuff like that. And that's a great example of our models are probably never going to be as capable as some of the things that Harvey's doing because our goal and our mission is really to solve this very general use case and then people can do things like fine-tuning and build all their own custom UI and product features on top of that.

(00:11:17):
I have a lot of empathy and a lot of excitement for people who are building these very general products today. I talk to a lot of developers who are building just general purpose assistants and general purpose agents and stuff like that. I think it's cool and it's a good idea. I think the challenge for them is they are going to end up directly competing against us in those spaces and I think there's enough room for a lot of people to be successful, but to me you shouldn't be surprised when we end up launching some general purpose agent product because, again, we're sort of building that with GPTs today and versus we're not going to launch some of these varied verticalized products. We're not going to launch an AI sales agent. That's just not what we're building towards. And companies who are and have some domain specific knowledge and they're really excited about that problem space, they can go into that and leverage our models and end up continuing to be on the cutting edge without having to do all that R&D effort themselves.

Lenny (00:12:16):
Got it. So the advice I'm hearing is get specific about use cases, and that could be either models that are tuned to be especially useful for a use case like sales or make an interface or experience solving a more specific problem.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:12:30):
And I think if you're going to try and solve this very general, if you're going to try to build the next general assistant to compete with something like ChatGPT, it has to be so radically different. People have to really be like, "Wow, this is solving these 10 problems that I have with ChatGPT, and therefore I'm going to go and try your new thing." Otherwise we're just putting a ton of engineering efforts and research effort into making that an incredible product, and it's just going to be the normal challenges of building companies. It's just hard to compete against something like that.

Lenny (00:12:59):
Awesome. Okay, that's great. I was going to get to that later, but I'm glad we touched on that. I imagine that's on the minds of many developers and founders. Kind of along the same lines, there's a lot of talk about how ChatGPT and GPTs and many of the tools you guys offer are going to make a company much more efficient. They don't need as many engineers, data scientists, PMs, things like that, but I think it's also hard for companies to think about what can we actually do to make our company more efficient. I'm curious if there's any examples that you can share of how companies have taken built a, say, a GPT internally to do something so that they don't have to spend engineering hours on it or generally just used OpenAI tooling to make their business internally more efficient?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:13:42):
Yeah, that's a great question. I wonder if you can put this in the show notes or something like that, but there's a really great Harvard Business School study about... And I forgot which consulting firm they did it with. Maybe it was like Boston Consulting or something like that, but it might've been one of the other ones. And they talk about the order of magnitude of efficiency gain for those folks who are using AI tools, I think it was chat GPT specifically in those use cases that they were using, comparatively against folks who aren't using AI. I'm really excited, also, just as just more time passes between the release of this technology, for us to get more empirical studies. I feel just for myself, as somebody who's an engineer today, I use ChatGPT and I can ship things way faster than I would be able to.

(00:14:26):
I don't have any good metrics for myself to put a specific number on it, but I'm guessing people are working on those studies right now. I think engineering is actually one of the highest leverage things that you could be using AI to do today and really unlocking, probably on the order of at least a 50% improvement, especially for some of the lower hanging fruit software engineering tasks. The models are just so capable at doing that work. And it's crazy to think... And I'm guessing, actually, GitHub probably has a bunch of really great studies they publish around copilots and you could use those as an analogy for what people are getting from ChatGPT as well. But those are probably the highest leverage things.

(00:15:07):
I think now with GPTs, people are able to go in and solve some of these more tactical problems. I think one of the general challenges with ChatGPT is it gives a decent answer for a lot of different use cases, but oftentimes it's not particular enough to the voice of your company or the nuance of the work that you're doing. And I think now with GPTs and people who are using the teams in ChatGPT and Enterprise in ChatGPT, they can actually build those things, incorporate the nuance of their own company, and make solving those tasks much, much more domain specific. So we literally just launched GPTs a couple of months ago, so I don't think there's been any good public success stories, but I'm guessing that success is happening right now at companies, and hopefully we'll hear more about that in the months to come as folks get super excited about sharing those case studies.

Lenny (00:15:58):
I'll share an example. So I have this good friend, his name's Dennis Yang, he works at Chime, and he told me about two things that they're doing at Chime that seem to be providing value. One is he built a GPT that helps write ads for Facebook and Google just gives you ideas for ads to run, and so that takes a little load off the marketing team or the growth team. And then he built another GPT that delivers experiment results, kind of like a data scientist, with here's the result of this experiment. And then you could talk to it and ask for like, "Hey, how much longer do you think we should run this for," or, "What might this imply about our product," and things like that. And I think it's really-

Logan Kilpatrick (00:15:58):
I love that.

Lenny (00:16:35):
Like you said. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just things you've heard people do just like, "Wow, that was a really smart way of... " So I get there's engineering, co-piloting type tooling. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just to give people a little inspiration of like, "Wow, that's an interesting way I should be thinking about using some of these tools."

Logan Kilpatrick (00:16:50):
I've seen some interesting GPTs around the planning use cases, like you want to do OKR planning for your team or something like that. I just actually saw somebody tweet it literally yesterday. I've seen some cool venture capital ones of doing diligence on a deal flow, which is kind of interesting, and getting some different perspectives. I think all of those horizontal use cases where you can bring in a different personality and get perspective on different things I think is really cool. I've personally used a GPT, the private GPT that I use myself that helps with some of the planning stuff for different quarters, and just making sure that I'm being consistent in how I'm framing things like driving back to individual metrics, stuff that, when people do planning, they often miss in our data, and then it's been super helpful for me to have a GPT to force me to think about some of those things.

Lenny (00:17:43):
Wait, can you talk more about this? What does this GPT do for you and what do you feed it?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:17:48):
Yeah, I forgot what article I saw online, but it was some article that was talking about what are the best ways to set yourself up for success in planning. And I took a bunch of the... I'll see if I can make it public after this and send you a link, but took a bunch of the examples from that and went in and put some of those suggestions into the GPT, and then now when I do any of my planning of I want to build this thing, I put it through and have it generate a timeline, generate all the specifics of what are the metrics and success that I'm looking for, who might be some important cross-functional stakeholders to include in the planning process, all that stuff, and it's been helpful.

Lenny (00:18:25):
Wow, that is very cool. That would be awesome if you made it public. And if you do, we'll link to it and we'll make it the number one most popular GPT in the store.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:18:35):
I love it.

Lenny (00:18:35):
Going in a slightly different direction, there's this whole genre of prompt engineering. It feels like it's one of these really emerging skills. I actually saw a startup hiring a prompt engineer, one of the startups I've invested in, and I think that's going to blow a lot of people's minds that there's this new job that's emerging. And I know the idea is this won't last forever, that in theory AI will be so smart you don't need to really think about how to be smart about asking it for things you need it to do. But can you just describe this idea of what is prompt engineering, this term that people might be hearing? And then even more interestingly, just what advice do you have for people to get better at writing prompts for, say, ChatGPT or through the API in general?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:19:13):
Yeah, this is such an interesting space, and I think it's another space where I'm excited for people to do more scientific empirical studies about, because there's so much gut feeling, best practices that maybe aren't actually true in a certain way. I think the reason that prompt engineering exists and comes up at all is because the models are so inclined, because of the way that they're trained, to give you just an answer to the question that you ask. Crap in crap out. If you ask a pretty basic question, you're going to get a pretty basic response. And actually the same thing is true for humans, and you can think of a great example of this. When I go to another human and I ask, "How's your day going," they say, "It's going pretty good."

(00:19:53):
Literally, absolutely zero detail, no nuance, not very interesting at all versus, again, if you have some context with a person, if you have a personal relationship with them and I ask you, "Hey Lenny, how's your day going? How did the last podcast go," et cetera, et cetera, you just have a little bit more context and agency to go and answer my question. I think this is prompt engineering.

(00:20:13):
My whole position on this is prompt engineering is a very human thing. When we want to get some value out of a human, we do this prompt engineering. We try to effectively communicate with that human in order to get the best output. And the same thing is true of models. And I think it's like, again, because we're using a system that appears to be really smart, we assume that it has all this context, but it's really like imagine a human level intelligence but literally no context. It has no idea what you're going to ask it. It's never met you before. It has no idea who you are, what you do, what your goals are. And it's the reason that you get super generic responses sometimes is because people forget they need to put that context in the model.

(00:20:57):
So I think the thing that is going to help solve this problem, and we already kind of do this in the context of Dali, so when you go to the image generation model that we have, Dali, and you say, "I want a picture of a turtle," what it does is it actually takes that description. It says, "I want a picture of a turtle," and it changes it into this high fidelity, like generate a picture of a turtle with a shell, with a green background and lily pads in the water and all this other. It adds all this fidelity because that's the way that the model is trained. It's trained on examples with super high fidelity. This will happen with text models.

(00:21:35):
You can imagine a world where you go into ChatGPT and you say, "Write me a blog post about AI." It automatically will go and be like, "Let me generate a much higher fidelity description of what this person really wants, which is generate me a blog post about AI that talks about the trade-offs between these different techniques and some example use cases and references some of the latest papers," and it does all that for you, and then you at the user will hopefully be able to be like, "Yep, this is kind of what I wanted. Let me edit this. Let me edit this here."

(00:22:02):
And again, the inherent problem is we're lazy as humans. We don't want to type all... We don't really want to type what we mean, and I think AI systems are actually going to help solve some of that problem.

Lenny (00:22:12):
So until that day, what can people do better when they're prompting, say ChatGPT? And I'll give you an example. Tim Ferris suggested this really good idea that I've been stealing, which is when you're preparing for an interview, you go to chat GPT. And so I did this for you. I was like, "Hey, I'm interviewing Logan Kilpatrick, he is head of developer relations at OpenAI, on my podcast. Give me 10 questions to ask him in the style of Tyler Cowen," who I think is the best interviewer. He is so good at just very pointed original questions. So what advice would you have for me to improve on that prompt to have better results? The questions were fine. They're great. They're interesting enough, but they weren't like, "Holy, these are incredible." So I guess what advice would you give me in that example?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:22:57):
Yeah, that's a great example where thinking in context of who it is that you're asking questions about. I'm probably not somebody who has enough information about me on the internet where the model actually has been trained and knows the nuances of my background. I think there's probably much more famous guests where it might be that there's enough context on the internet to answer the questions. You actually have to do some of that work. You need to, say if you're using browse with Bing, for example, you could say, "Here's a link to Logan's blog and some of the things that he's talked about. Here's a link to his Twitter. Go through some of his tweets, go through some of his blogs and see what his interesting perspectives are that we might want to surface on the blog," or something like that.

(00:23:36):
It's, again, giving the model enough context to answer the question. I think, again, that prompt actually might work really well for somebody who has it, if you were interviewing Tom Cruise or something like that, somebody who has a lot of information about them on the internet. It probably works a little bit better.

Lenny (00:23:52):
So the advice there is just give more context. It doesn't tell you, "Hey, I don't actually know that much about Logan, so give me some more information." It's just like, "Here you go. Here's a bunch of good questions."

Logan Kilpatrick (00:24:00):
Exactly. It wants to. It so deeply wants to answer your question. It doesn't care that it doesn't have enough context. It's the most eager person in the world you could imagine to answer the question, and without that context it's just hard to do, to give anything a value. If we got t-shirts printed, they should say, "Context is all you need. Context is the only thing that matters." It's such an important piece of getting a language model to do anything for you.

Lenny (00:24:26):
Any other tips? Just as people are sitting there, maybe they have ChatGPT open right now as they're crafting a prompt, is there anything else that you'd say would help them have better results?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:24:37):
We actually have a prompt engineering guide, which folks should go and check out. It has some of the examples. It depends on the order of magnitude of how much performance increase you can get. There's a lot of really small silly things, like adding a smiley face, increases the performance of the model. I'm sure folks have seen a lot of these silly examples, but telling the model to take a break and then answer the question, all these kinds of things. And again, if you think about it, it's because the corpus of information that's trained these models is the same things that humans have sent back and forth to each other. So you telling a human, "When I go take a break and then I come back to work, I'm fresher and I'm able to answer questions better and do work better," so very similar things are true for these models. And again, when I see a smiley face at the end of someone's message, I feel empowered that this is going to be a positive interaction and I should be more inclined to give them a great answer and spend more effort on the thing that they asked me for.

Lenny (00:25:34):
Wow, wait. So that's a real thing. If you had a smiley face, it might give you better results.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:25:39):
Again, it's like the challenge with all this stuff is it's very nuanced and it's also it's a small jump in performance. You could imagine on the order of one or 2%, which for a few sentence answer might not even be a discernible difference. Again, if you're generating an entire saga of texts, the smiley face could actually make a material difference for you, but for something small and textual it might not.

Lenny (00:26:03):
Okay, good tip. Amazing. Okay, we've talked about GPTs I think maybe might be helpful to describe what is this new thing that you guys launched, GPTs, and I'm curious just how it's going. This is a really big change and element of OpenAI now with this idea that you could build your own mini, and I'm almost explaining it, your mini open ChatGPT and then people can... I think you can pay for it. You can charge for your own GPT or is it all free right now?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:26:29):
It's ll free right now. It's all free.

Lenny (00:26:31):
Okay. In the future I imagine people will be able to charge. So there's this whole store now. Basically it's the whole app store that you guys have launched. How's it going? What's happening? What surprised you there? What should people know?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:26:42):
Yeah, it's going great, and again, historically the thing that you would have to do, let's say for example, you have a really cool ChatGPT use case, what you would have to do to share it with somebody else is actually go in and start the conversation with the model, prompt it to do the things that you wanted to, and then you would share that link with somebody else before the action has actually happened and be like, here now you can essentially finish this conversation with ChatGPT that I started.

(00:27:08):
So GPT kind of changes this where you take all that important context, you put it into the model to begin with, and then people can go and chat with essentially a custom version of ChatGPT. And the thing that's really interesting is you can upload files, you can give it custom instructions, you can add all these different tools. Like a code interpreter is built in, which allows you to do math. Essentially you have browsing built in, image generation built in. You can also, for more advanced use cases if you're a developer, you can connect it to external APIs so you can connect it to the Notion API or Gmail or all these different things, and have it actually take actions on your behalf.

(00:27:44):
So there's so many cool things that people are unlocking. And what's been most exciting to me, actually, is the non-developer persona is now empowered to go and solve these really, really, really more challenging problems by giving the model enough context on what that problem is to be able to solve it. Going back to context is all you need, this is very true in the context of GPTs, and if you give it enough context, you can solve much more interesting problems.

(00:28:11):
There's so many things that I'm excited about with this. I think monetization, when it comes to the store later this quarter, I think is going to be extremely exciting when people can get paid based on who's using their GPT. That's going to be a huge unlock and open a lot of people's eyes to the opportunity here. I also think continuing to push on making more capabilities accessible to GPTs for people who can't code is really exciting. Even for me as someone who is a software engineer, it's not super easy to connect the Notion API or the Gmail API to my GPT, and really I'd love to just be able to one click sign in with Gmail and then all of a sudden it's like my Gmail is accessible, or someone else can sign in with their Gmail and make it accessible. So I think over time all those types of things will come, but today it's really custom prompts is essentially one of the biggest value adds with GPTs.

Lenny (00:29:03):
Awesome. I have it pulled up here on different monitor and Canva has the top GPT currently, and I was trying to play with it as you're chatting just to see. I was going to make a big banner that said, "It's the context stupid," and it doesn't. I'm not doing something right, but I'm not paying that much attention to it because we're talking, but this is very cool. Just maybe a final question there. Is there a GPT that you saw someone built that was like, "Wow, that's amazing. That's so cool," something that surprised you? And I'll share one that was very cool, but is there anything that comes to mind when I ask that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:29:33):
I think my instinct is the Zapier. All of the stuff that Zapier has done with GPTs is the most useful stuff that you could imagine. You can go so far with what... And I don't know how it's packaged for Zapier's GPT right now, but you can actually, as a third party developer, integrate Zapier without knowing how to code into your GPT. So they're pushing a lot of this stuff, and then basically all 5,000 connections that are possible with Zapier today, you can bring into your GPT and essentially enable it to do anything. So I'm incredibly excited for Zapier and for people who are building with them so many things that you can unlock using that platform. So I think that's probably the most exciting thing to me for people who aren't developers.

Lenny (00:30:20):
Awesome. Zapier's always in there, getting in there connecting things.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:30:23):
Yeah, they're great.

Lenny (00:30:25):
So the one that I had in mind, so I had a buddy of mine, [inaudible 00:30:28], who's the CEO of a company called Runway built this thing called Universal Primer which helps you learn. It's described as, "Learn everything about anything," and basically, I think, it's kind of this Socratic method of helping you learn stuff. So it's like, "Explain how transformers work in LMs," and then it just kind goes through stuff and then asks you questions, I think, and helps you learn new concepts. And I think it's the number two education GPT.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:30:53):
I love that. [inaudible 00:30:53] is incredible, so...

Lenny (00:30:54):
Yes, it's true. Let me tell you about a product called Arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished, on-brand demos in minutes. Telling the story of your product is hard and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why Product Four teams such as Atlassian, Carta and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails and documentation.

(00:31:23):
But don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a 2X higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos. On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before. Creating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale.

(00:31:50):
Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.

(00:32:11):
I want to talk about just what it's like to work at OpenAI and how the product team operates and how the company operates. So you worked at... Your two previous companies were Apple and NASA, which are not known for moving fast. And now you're at OpenAI, which is known for moving very fast, maybe too fast for some people's taste, as we saw it with the whole board thing. And so what I'm curious is just what is it that OpenAI does so well that allows them to build and ship so quickly and at such a high bar? Is there a process or a way of working that you've seen that you think other companies should try to move more quickly and ship better stuff?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:32:48):
Yeah, there's so many interesting trade-offs and all of this tension around how quickly companies can move. I think for us, again, if you think about Apple as an example, if you think about NASA as an example, just older institutions, lots of... Over time, the tendency is things slow down. There's additional checks and balances that are put in place, which drags things down a little bit. So we're young and a new company, so we don't have a lot of that institutional legacy barriers that have been put in place.

(00:33:18):
I think the biggest thing, and there's a good Sam tweet somewhere in the ether about this from, I think, 2022 or something like that, but finding people who are high agency and work with urgency is one of the most... If I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to either get 50 people's different consensus, because you have people who you trust with high agency and they can just go and do the thing, I think, is one of the most... It is the most important thing, I'm pretty sure, if you were to distill it down.

(00:34:04):
And I see this in folks that I work with. Folks are so high agency. They see a problem and they go and tackle it. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that I think traditional companies are stuck behind because they're like, "Oh, let's check with all these seven different departments to try to get feedback on this." People just go and do it and solve the problem. And I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.

Lenny (00:34:35):
That is so cool. I really like these two characteristics because I haven't heard this before. Those are the two, maybe the two most important things you guys look for, high agency, high urgency. To give people a clear sense of what these actually look like when you're hiring, you shared maybe this example of customer service. Someone's hearing a bug and then going to fix it. Is there anything else that can illustrate what that looks like, high agency? And then a similar question on urgency other than just move, move, move, ship, ship, ship.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:35:01):
I think the assistants API that we released for dev day, we continue to get this feedback from developers that people wanted these higher levels of abstraction on top of our existing APIs, and a bunch of folks on the team just came together and were like, "Hey, let's put together what the plan would look like to build something like this," And then very quickly came together and actually built the actual API that now powers so many people's assistant applications that are out there. And I think that's a great example of it wasn't this top down, oh, someone's sitting there being like, "Oh, let's do these five things," and then like, "Okay, team, go and do that." It's like people really seeing these problems that are coming up and knowing that they can come together as a team and solve these problems really quickly. And I think the assistants API, and there's like 1,001 other examples of teams taking agency and doing this, but I think that's a great one at the top of my head

Lenny (00:35:55):
That makes me want to ask. Just how does planning work at OpenAI? So in this example is just like, "Hey, we think we need to build this. Let's just go and build it." I imagine there's still a roadmap and priorities and goals and things that that team had. How does road mapping and prioritization and all of that generally work to allow for something like that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:36:14):
I think this is one of the more challenging pieces at OpenAI. There's so many. Everyone wants everything from us, and today, especially, in the world of ChatGPT and how large and well-used our API is, people will just come to us and say, "Hey, we want all of these things." I think there's a bunch of core guiding principles that we look at. One, going back to the mission, is this actually going to help us get to AGI? So there's a huge focus on there's this potential shiny reward right in front of us, which is optimize user engagement, or whatever it is. And is that really the thing? Maybe the answer is yes. Maybe that is what is going to help us get to AGI sooner, but looking at it through that lens I think is always the first step of deciding any of these problems.

(00:37:03):
I think, on the developer side, there's also these core tenets of reliability like, "Hey, it would be awesome if we had additional APIs that did all these cool things like new endpoints, new modalities, new abstractions, but are we giving customers a robust and reliable experience on our API?" And that's often the first question. And I think there have been times where we've fallen short on that, and there was a bunch of other things that we've been thinking about doing and really bringing the focus and priority back to that reliability piece because, at the end of the day, nobody cares if you have something great if they can't use it robust and reliably.

(00:37:37):
So there's these core tenets. And I think, again, we have very, other than all the principles about how we're making the decision, I think the actual planning process is pretty standard. We come together. There's H1 Q1 goals. We all sprint on those. I think the real interesting thing is how stuff changes over time. You think we're going to do these very high level things and new models, new modalities, whatever it is. And then as time goes on, there's all of this turmoil and change, and it's interesting to have mechanisms to be like, "Hey, how do we update our understanding of the world and our goals as everything the ground changes underneath of us as is happening in the craziness of the AI space today?"

Lenny (00:38:22):
It's interesting that it sounds a lot like most other companies. There's H1 planning. There's Q1 planning. Are there metrics and goals like that that you guys have OKRs or anything like that? Or is it just, Here we're going to launch these products?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:38:33):
I think it's much higher level. I actually don't think OpenAI is a big OKR company. I don't think teams do OKRs today and I don't have a good understanding of why that's the case, whether or not. I don't even know if OKRs are still the industry. You're probably talking to a lot more folks about who are making those decisions. So I'm curious. Is that something that you're seeing from folks? Is it still common for people to do OKRs?

Lenny (00:38:55):
Yeah, absolutely. Many companies use OKRs, love OKRs. Many companies hate OKRs. I'm not surprised that OpenAI is not an OKR driven company. Along those lines, I don't know how much you can share about all this stuff, but how do you measure success for things that you launch? I know there's this ultimate goal, AGI. Is there some way to track we're getting closer? What else do you guys look at when you launch, say DPT Store or assistants or anything that's like, "Cool, that was exactly what we're hoping for." Is it just adoption?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:39:20):
Yeah, adoption is a great one. I think there's a bunch of metrics around revenue, number of developers that are building on our platform, all those things. And a lot of these, and I don't want to dive... I'll let Sam or someone else on our leadership team go more into details, but I think a lot of these are actual abstractions towards something else. Even if revenue is a goal, it's like revenue is not actually the goal. Revenue is a proxy for getting more compute, which is then actually what helps us get towards getting more GPUs so that we can train better models and actually get to the goal. So there's all these intermediate layers where even if we say something is the goal, and you hear that in a vacuum and you're like, "Oh, well OpenAI just wants to make money," and it's like, "Well, really money is the mechanism to get better models so that we can achieve our mission." And I think there's a bunch of interesting angles like that as well.

Lenny (00:40:12):
I don't know if I've heard of a more ambitious vision for a company, to build artificial general intelligence. I love that. I imagine many companies are like, "What's our version of that?" Before we leave this topic, is there anything else that you've seen OpenAI do really well that allows it to move this fast and be this successful? You talked about hiring people with higher agency and high urgency. Is there anything else that's just like, "Oh wow, that's a really good way of operating?" I imagine part of it's just hiring incredibly smart people. I think that's probably an unsaid thing, but yeah, anything else?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:40:45):
I think there's a non-trivial benefit to using Slack, and I think maybe that's controversial and maybe some people don't like Slack, but OpenAI has such a slack heavy culture and it really... The instantaneous real time communication on Slack is so crucial. And I just love being able to tag in different people from different teams and get everybody coalesced. So everybody is always on Slack, so even if you're remote or you're on a different team or in a different office, so much of the company culture is ingrained in Slack, and it allows us to really quickly coordinate where it's actually faster to send someone a Slack message sometimes than it would be to walk over to their desk because they're on Slack and they're going to be using it.

(00:41:27):
And I saw, if you saw, the recent Sam and Bill Gates interview, but Sam was talking about how Slack is his number one most used app on his phone and, "I don't even look at the time thing on my phone anymore because I don't want to know how long I'm using Slack," but I'm sure the Salesforce people are looking at the numbers and they're like, "This is exactly what we wanted."

Lenny (00:41:46):
I also love Slack. I'm a big promoter Slack. I think there's a lot of Slack hate, but such a good product. I've tried so many alternatives and nothing compares. I think what's interesting about Slack for you guys is one of the... You don't know if someone in there is just an AGI, that is not actually a person that's just there working at the company.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:42:01):
I know there are real people. There is no AGIs yet. But I think, yeah, even Slack is building a bunch of really cool AI tools, which I'm excited to... And that's why there's so much cool AI progress. And at the end of the day, it's so exciting, from being a consumer of all these new AI products. Google's a great example. I'm so happy that Google is doing really cool AI stuff because I'm a Google Docs customer and I love using Google Docs. I like a bunch of their other products, and it's awesome that people are building such useful things around these models.

Lenny (00:42:33):
How big is the OpenAI team at this point, whatever you can share? Just to give people a sense of the scale.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:42:38):
Yeah, I think the last public number was something around like 750 near the end of last year, 780 or something like that near the end of last year. And we're still growing so quickly, so I won't be the messenger to share the specific updated numbers, but the team is growing like crazy and we're also hiring across all of our engineering teams and PM teams, so folks who are interested, would love to hear from folks who are curious about joining.

Lenny (00:43:03):
Maybe one last question here. So you're growing, maybe getting to 1,000 people, clearly still very innovative and moving incredibly fast. Is there anything you've seen about what OpenAI does well to enable innovation and not slow down new big ideas?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:43:19):
Yeah, there's a couple of things, one of which is the actual research team, who seed most of the innovation that happens at OpenAI, is intentionally small. Most of the growth that OpenAI has seen is around our customer facing roles, our engineering roles to provide the infrastructure for ChatGPT and things like that. The research team is, again, intentionally kept small and there's all of this talk. And it's really interesting. I just saw this thread from one of our research folks who was talking about how in a world where you're constrained by the amount of GPU capacity that you have as a researcher, which is the case for open AI researchers, but also researchers everywhere else, each new researcher that you add is actually a net productivity loss for the research group unless that person is up-leveling everyone else in such a profound way that it increases the efficiency.

(00:44:12):
If you just add somebody who's going to go and tackle some completely different research direction, you now have to share your GPUs with that person and everyone else is now slower on their experiments. So it's a really interesting trade-off that research folks have that I don't think product folks... If I add another engineer to our API team or to some of the ChatGPT teams, you can actually write more code and do more. And that's actually a net beneficial improvement for everybody. And that's always not the case in the case of researchers, which is interesting, in A GPU constrained world, which hopefully we won't always be in.

Lenny (00:44:46):
I want to zoom out a bit and then there's going to be a couple follow-up questions here. Where are things heading with OpenAI? What's in the near future of what people should expect from the tools that you guys are going to have in launch?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:44:58):
Yeah, new modalities. I think ChatGPT continuing to push all of the different experiences that are going to be possible. Today, ChatGPT is really just text in, text out or, I guess three months ago, it was just text in, text out. We started to change that with now you can do the voice mode and now you can generate images and now you can take pictures. So I think continuing to expand the way in which you interface with AI through ChatGPT is coming.

(00:45:24):
I think GPTs is our first step towards the agent future. Again, today when you use A GPT, it's really you send a message, you get an answer back almost right away, and that's kind of the end of your interaction. I think as GPTs continue to get more robust, you'll actually be able to say, "Hey, go and do this thing and just let me know when you're done. I don't need the answer right now. I want you to really spend time and be thoughtful about this."

(00:45:48):
And again, if you think back to all these human analogies, that's what we do as humans. I don't expect somebody, when I ask them to do something meaningful for me, to do it right away and give me the answer back right away. So I think pushing more towards those experiences is what is going to unlock so much more value for people.

(00:46:06):
And I think the last thing is GPTs as this mechanism to get the next few hundred million people into ChatGPT and into AI. So I think if you've had conversations with people who aren't close to the AI space, oftentimes you talk about, even if they've heard of ChatGPT... A lot of people haven't heard of ChatGPT, but if they have, they show up in ChatGPT and they're like, "I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with this blank slate. I can kind of do anything. It's not super clear how this solves my specific problem."

(00:46:35):
But I think the cool thing about GPTs is you can package down like, "Here's this one very specific problem that AI can solve for you and do it really well," and I can share that experience with you and now you can go and try that GPT, have it actually solve the problem and be like, "Wow, it did this thing for me. I should probably spend the time to investigate these five other problems that I have to see if AI can also be a solution to those." So I think so many more people are going to come online and start using these tools because very narrow vertical tools are what's going to be a huge unlock for them.

Lenny (00:47:07):
So in that last case, a classic horizontal product problem where it does so many things and people don't know what exactly it should do for them. So that makes a ton of sense. Just being a lot more template oriented, use case specific, helping people onboard makes tons of sense. A common problem for so many SaaS products out there. The other ones you mentioned, which was really interesting, basically more interfaces to more easily interact with OpenAI voice. You mentioned audio and things like that. That makes tons of sense. And then this agents piece where the idea is, instead of just it's a chat, it's like, "Hey, go do this thing for me."

(00:47:42):
Kind of along those lines, GPT-5, we touched on this a bit. There's a lot of speculation about the much better version. People just have these wild expectations, I think, for where GPT is going. GPT-5 is going to solve all the world's problems. I know you're not going to tell me when it's launching and what it's going to do, but I heard from a friend that there's kind of this tip that when you're building products today, you should build towards a GPT-5 future, not based on limitations of GPT-4 today. So to help people do that, what should people think about that might be better in a world of GPT-5? Is it just faster? It's just smarter? Is there anything else that might be like, "Oh wow, I should really rethink how I'm approaching my product?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:48:22):
If folks have looked through the GPT-4 technical report that we released back in March when GPT-4 came out, GPT-4 was the first model that we trained where we could reliably predict the capabilities of that model beforehand based on the amount of computes that we were going to put into it. We did a scientific study to show like, "Hey, this is what we predicted and here is what the actual outcome was." So it'll be, one I think, just as somebody who's interested in technology, but interesting to see does that continue to hold for GPT-5, and hopefully we'll some of that information whenever that model comes out.

(00:48:56):
I also think you can probably draw a few observations. One of them, which is GPT-4 came out. The consensus from the world is, "Everything is different. All of a sudden everything is different. This changes the world. This changes everything." And then slowly but surely, we come back to reality of like, "This is a really effective tool and it's going to help solve my problems more effectively."

(00:49:21):
And I think that is the, undoubtedly, the lens in which people should look at all of these model advancements, like GPT-5 is surely going to be extremely useful and solve some whole new echelon of problems. Hopefully it'll be faster. Hopefully It'll be better in all these ways, but fundamentally, the same problems that exists in the world are still going to be the same problems. You now just have a better tool to solve those problems.

(00:49:44):
And I think going back to vertical use cases, I think people who are solving very specific use cases are just now going to be able to do that much more effectively. I don't think that's going to... People have these unrealistic expectations that GPT-5 is going to be doing back flips in the background in my bedroom while it also writes all my code for me and talks on the phone with my mom or something like that.

(00:50:06):
I'm like, "That's not the case." It's just going to be this very effective tool, very similar to GPT-4, and it's also going to be become very normal very quickly. And I think that is actually a really interesting piece. If you can plan for the world where people become very used to these tools very quickly, I actually think that's an edge, and assuming that this thing is going to absolutely change everything, and in many ways I think it's actually a downside, is the wrong mental framing to have of these tools as they come out.

Lenny (00:50:39):
Kind of along these lines, you guys are investing a lot into B2B offerings. I think half the revenue, last I heard, was B2B and then half is B2C. I don't know if that's true, but that's something I heard. What is it that you get if you work with opening AI as a company, as a business? What does it unlock? Is it just called OpenAI Enterprise? What's it called and what do you get as a part of that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:51:01):
Yeah, so I think a lot of our B2B customers are using the API to build stuff. So I think that's one angle of it. I think if you're a ChatGPT B2B customer, we sell Teams, which is the ability to get multiple subscriptions of ChatGPT packaged together. We also have an enterprise version of ChatGPT. There's a bunch of enterprise-y things that enterprise companies want, around SSO and stuff like that, related to ChatGPT Enterprise.

(00:51:25):
I think the coolest thing is actually being able to share some of these prompt templates and GPTs internally. So again, you can make custom things that work really well for your company with all of the information that's relevant to solving problems at your company and share those internally. And to me, that's like you want to be able to collaborate with your teammates on the cool things you create using AI. So that's a huge unlock for companies. I think that those are the two biggest value adds. There's higher limits and stuff like that on some of those models, but I think being able to share your very domain specific applications is the most useful thing.

Lenny (00:52:00):
I think if you're a company listening and you think a lot of employees are using ChatGPT, basically the simplest thing you could do is just roll it up into a business account with single sign-on and that probably saves you money and makes it easier to coordinate and administer.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:52:14):
Yeah, there's also a bunch of security stuff too, like if you want to control. You don't want people to use certain GPTs from the GPT store because you're worried about security or privacy and stuff like that. You don't want your private data going in places. It makes a lot of sense to sign up for that so that you have a little bit more control over what's happening.

Lenny (00:52:29):
Okay, got it. There's a launch happening tomorrow, I think, after we're recording this. Can you talk about what is new, what's coming out? I think this is going to come out a couple weeks after recording, but just what should people know that's new that's coming out from OpenAI tomorrow in our world?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:52:45):
Yeah, updated, so there's a few different things. A couple of quick ones are updated GPT-4 Turbo model, updated the preview model that we released that dev day. There's an updated version of that. It fixes this, if folks have seen online people talking about this sort of laziness phenomenon in the model. We improve on that and it fixes a lot of the cases where that was the case. So hopefully the model will be a little bit less lazy. The big thing is the third generation embeddings model. So we were talking off-camera before recording about all of the cool use cases for embedding. So if folks have used embeddings before, it's essentially the technology that powers many of these question and answering with your own documentation or your own corpus of knowledge. And like you were saying, you actually have a website where people can ask questions about recordings of the podcast.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Lennybot.com. Check it out.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:53:35):
Yeah, lennybot.com. And my assumption was that lennybot.com is actually powered by embedding. So you take all of the corpus of knowledge. You take all the recordings, your blog post. You embed them, and then when people ask questions, you can actually go in and see the similarity between the question and the corpus of knowledge and then provide an answer to somebody's question and reference an empirical fact, something that's true from your knowledge base. And this is super useful and people are doing a ton of this. It's like trying to ground these models in reality, in what they know to be true. We know all the things from your podcast to be at least something that you've said before and to be true in that sense, and we can bring them into the answer that the model is actually generating in response to a question. So that'll be super cool.

(00:54:20):
And these new V3 embeddings models, again, state-of-the-art performance, the cool thing is actually the non-English performance has increased super significantly. I think historically, people really were only using embeddings for... It only worked really well for English, and I think now you can use it across so many new languages because it's just so much more performant across those languages and it's five times cheaper as well, which is wonderful. There's no better feeling than making things cheaper for people. I love it. I think now it's like you can embed, I'm pretty sure, it was like 62,000 pages of text for $1, which is very, very cheap. So lots of really cool things that you can do with embeddings and exciting to see people invent more stuff.

Lenny (00:55:07):
What a deal. Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Say you're a product manager at a big company, or even a founder, what do you think are the biggest opportunities for them to leverage the tech that you guys are building, GPT-4, all the other APIs? How should people be thinking about, "Here's how we should really think about leveraging this power in our existing product," or new product, whichever direction you want to go.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:55:34):
Yeah, I think going back to this theme of new experiences is really exciting to me. I think consumers are just going to be... You are going to have an edge on other people if you're providing AI that's not accessible in a Chatbot. People are using a ton of chat and it's a really valuable service area. It's clearly valuable because people are using it. But I think products that move beyond this chat interface really are going to have such an advantage. And also, thinking about how to take your use case to the next level. I've tried a ton of chat examples that are very, very basic and providing a little bit of value to me, but I'm like, "Really this should go much further and actually build your core experience from the ground up."

(00:56:20):
I've used this product that allows you to essentially manage or view the conversations that are happening online around certain topics and stuff like that. So I can go and look online. What are people saying about GPT-4? And what I just said out loud, "What are people saying about GPT-4," is the actual question that I have. And in a normal product experience today, I have to go into a bunch of dashboards and change a bunch of filters and stuff like that. And what I really want is just ask my question. What are people doing? What are people saying about GPT-4? Get an answer to that question in a very data grounded way.

(00:56:55):
And I've seen people solve part of this problem where, oh, they'll be like, "Oh, well here's a few examples of what people are saying and, well, that's not really what I want. I want this summary of what's happening." And I think it just takes a little bit more engineering effort to make that happen. But I think it's like that is the magical unlock of like, "Wow, this is an incredible product that I'm going to continue to use," instead of like, "Yeah, this is kind of useful, but I really want more."

Lenny (00:57:21):
Awesome. I'll give a shout-out to a product. I'm not an investor, but I know the founder, called visualelectric.com, which I think is doing exactly this. It's basically a tool specifically built for creatives, I think specifically graphic design, to help them create imagery. So there's like Dali, obviously, but this takes it to a whole new level where it's kind of this canvas, infinite canvas, that you could just generate images, edit, tweak them, and continue to rate until you have the thing that you need. Visualelectric.com.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:57:48):
I'm going to try that out. Is it similar to Canva?

Lenny (00:57:50):
It's even more niche, I think, for more sophisticated graphic design, I think, is the use case. But I'm not a designer, so I'm not the target customer. But I will say my wife is a graphic designer. She had never used AI tools. I showed her this and she got hooked on it. She paid for it without even telling me that she was going to become a paid customer, and she created imagery of our dog and all this art. And now it's like on our TV. The art she created is now sitting... It's like we have a frame TV, and that's the image on our TV. So anyway...

Logan Kilpatrick (00:58:21):
I love that. What was it called again?

Lenny (00:58:23):
Visualelectric.com. Anyway, anything else you wanted to touch on or share before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:58:31):
I've made this statement a few times online and other places, but for people who have cool ideas that they should build with AI, this is the moment. There are so many cool things that need to be built for the world using AI. And again, if I or other folks on the team at OpenAI can be helpful in getting you over the hump of starting that journey of building something really cool, please reach out. The world needs more cool solutions using these tools, and would love to hear about the awesome stuff that people are building.

Lenny (00:59:01):
I would've asked you this at the end, but how would people reach out? What's the best way to actually do that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:06):
Twitter, LinkedIn. My email should be findable somewhere. I don't want to say it and then get slammed with a bunch of email. You should be able to sign my email, if you need it, online somewhere. But yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn is usually the easiest place.

Lenny (00:59:18):
And how do they find you on Twitter?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:21):
It's just Logan Kilpatrick, or I think my name shows up as Logan.GPT or-

Lenny (00:59:21):
Logan.GPT?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:26):
Or official Logan K.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Yeah. Awesome. Okay. And we'll link into it in the show notes. Amazing. Well Logan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny (00:59:35):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:39):
I think the first one is one that I read a long time ago and came back to recently, is the One Room Schoolhouse by Sal Khan. Incredible. Yeah, I don't want... It's the lightning round so I won't say too much, but incredible story and AI is what is going to enable Sal Khan's vision of a teacher per student to actually happen. So I'm really excited about that. And the other one is, that I always come back to, is Why We Sleep. Sleep science are so cool. If you don't care about your sleep, it's one of the biggest up-levels that you can do for yourself.

Lenny (01:00:14):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:00:18):
I'm a sucker for a good inspirational human story. So I watched, with my family recently over the holidays, this Gran Turismo movie, and it's a story about someone who, a kid from London, who grew up doing SIM racing, which is a virtual race car, and did this competition, ended up becoming a real professional race car driver through some competition. And it's just really cool to see someone go from driving a virtual car to driving a real car and competing in the 24-hour Le Mans and all that stuff.

Lenny (01:00:50):
I used to play that game and it was a lot of fun, but I don't think I have any clue how to drive a real car, race car. So that's inspiring. Do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:03):
Yeah, I'm always curious to hear what people's... The thing that they so strongly believe that people disagree with them on.

Lenny (01:01:12):
What do you look for in an answer that seems like, Wow, that's a really good signal?"

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:17):
Oftentimes, it's just an entertaining question to ask in some sense, but it's also... It's interesting to see what somebody's deeply held strong belief is, I think. And not to judge whether or not I believe in that, but just curious to see why people feel that way.

Lenny (01:01:35):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:38):
On the narrative of sleep, I have this really nice sleep mask from this company called... Not being paid. I just say this, but it's called Manta Sleep or something like that. It's a weighted sleep mask and it feels incredible when I... I don't know. Maybe I just have a heavy head or something like that, but it feels good to wear a weighted sleep mask at night. I really appreciate it.

Lenny (01:02:01):
I have a competing sleep mask that I highly recommend. I'm trying to find it. I've emailed people about it a couple of times in my newsletter for gift guides.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:09):
Okay. My favorite is called the Waoaw Sleep Mask, W-A-O-A-

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:15):
What do you like about it?

Lenny (01:02:16):
W-A-O-A-W. I'll link to it in the show notes. It makes a lot of room. It's very large and there's space for your eyes, so your eyelashes and whatever eyes aren't pressed on, and it just fits really nicely around the head. And my wife, we both wear eye masks at night. It just, speaking of sleep, really helps us sleep. [inaudible 01:02:37] It doesn't have the weight-ness piece, so it might be worth trying, but everyone I've recommended this to is like, "That changed my life. Thank you for helping me sleep better." And so we'll link to [inaudible 01:02:51].

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:17):
Look at that.

Lenny (01:02:50):
Look at us. So adult. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:58):
Yeah, I've got it. It's on a Post-It note that I... Right behind my camera and it's "Measure in hundreds." I love this idea of measuring things in hundreds, and it's for folks who are at the beginning of some journey. I talk to people all the time, they're like, "Yeah, I've tried this thing and it hasn't worked." And if your mental model is to measure in hundreds, "I measure in hundreds," the five times that you failed at something, you failed and tried zero times. And I love that. It's such a great reminder that everything in life is built on compounding and multiple attempts at stuff. And if you don't try enough times, you're never going to be successful at it.

Lenny (01:03:38):
I love that. I could see why you are successful at OpenAI and why you're a good fit there. Final question. So I asked ChatGPT for a very silly question. "Give me a bunch of silly questions to ask Logan Kilpatrick, head of developer relations at OpenAI," and I went through a bunch. I have three here, but I'm going to pick one. If an AI started doing standup comedy, what do you think would be its go-to joke or funny observation about humans?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:06):
I think today, I think if you were to do this, I think the go-to question would be something along the, "So an AI walks into a bar," and likely because, again, it's trained on some distribution of training data, and that's the most common joke that comes up, and that's probably... I wonder if you came up with a joke right now, whether or not that would show up in one of the examples.

Lenny (01:04:31):
I love it. What would be the joke though? We need the joke. We need the punchline. I'm just joking. I know you can't come up with amazing-

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:37):
That's what we have ChatGPT for.

Lenny (01:04:41):
We're already irrelevant. Amazing. Logan, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, even though you've already shared this information, but just for folks to remind them. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and ask you more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:55):
Yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn, Logan Kilpatrick or Logan.GPT on Twitter. Please shoot me messages. I get a ton of DMs from people and it's always really, really interesting stuff. I think the thing that I would love to have help on is if people find bugs and things that don't work well in ChatGPT, I oftentimes see people be like, "This thing didn't work really well." And the key, and I think we as OpenAI need to do a better job of messaging this to people, but having shared chats or actual, tangible, reproducible examples, are the two things that we need in order to actually fix the problems that people have. The model laziness was a good example where it was hard to figure out what was going on because people would be like, "Oh, the model's lazier," but it's hard to figure out what were the prompts they were using. What was the examples, all that stuff? So send those examples as you come up on things that don't work well and we'll make stuff better for you.

Lenny (01:05:49):
Amazing. And I'll also just remind people, if you're listening to this and you're like, "Oh, okay, cool. A lot of cool ideas for OpenAI and ChatGPT," what you need to do is actually just go to chat.openai.com and try this stuff out. There's a lot of just theorizing, but I think once you actually start doing it, you start to see things a little differently. And at this point, every day I'm in there doing something, like asking for ideas for questions, doing research on a newsletter post, and it's just a tab I'm always coming back to. And I know there's a lot of people just talking about this sort of thing, and I just want to remind people. Just go. Sign in. Play with it. Ask it questions on something you're working on and just see how it goes and keep coming back to it. Is there anything else you want to share along those lines to inspire people to give this a shot?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:06:34):
I love it. I think the phrase of people being worried about humans being replaced by AI, and I've seen this narrative online, that it's not AI that's going to replace humans. It's other humans that are being augmented and using AI tools that are going to be more competitive in a job market and stuff like that. So go and try these AI tools. This is the best time to learn. You're going to be more productive and empowered in your job and the things that you're excited about. So yeah, excited to see what people use ChatGPT for.

Lenny (01:07:01):
And then you can expense your account. I think it's 10 or 20 bucks a month. A lot of companies are paying for this for you, so ask your boss if you can just have it expensed and make sure you use the latest version. Anyway, Logan, thank you again so much for being here.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:16):
This is awesome, Lenny. Thanks for having me in. Thoughtful questions. Hopefully those weren't all from ChatGPT.

Lenny (01:07:20):
Nope, only the last one. I did have a bunch of others I had in the belt or in the pocket. I don't know what the metaphor is. In the back pocket, that's the metaphor, but I did not get to them because we had enough great stuff. So no, that was all me. Human AI.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:35):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:07:36):
Thanks, Logan.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:37):

# Leveraging growth advisors, mastering SEO, and honing your craft | Luc Levesque (Shopify, Meta)

## Transcript

Luc Levesque (00:00:00):
We talk about the 10X engineer and we don't really talk about the 10X growth advisor or 10X growth person, but the same dynamic applies. You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact. Something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, "Okay, here's the needle in the haystack." And then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

Before this, he was recruited personally by Mark Zuckerberg to help grow Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. He's also VP of Growth and a GM at Tripadvisor. He's also been a growth advisor to companies like Twitter, Pinterest, Patreon, Thumbtack, and Canva.

Lenny (00:01:05):
In our conversation, Luc shares advice on how and when to think about getting a growth advisor, including how to structure the relationship and what to look for in an advisor. We also spent a ton of time on SEO, how to think about this as a growth channel, who it's well suited for, and how everything is about to change in SEO with Bard and ChatGPT. Plus Luc shares a ton of really interesting advice around the value of self-reflection, building routines, cold plunges, also a couple of amazing stories about working with Zuck and what you learned from him. This is such an insight rich episode and I know you'll love it. With that, I bring you Luc Levesque after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:31):
Luc, welcome to the podcast.

Luc Levesque (00:03:34):
Thank you. Good to see you.

Lenny (00:03:36):
It's good to see you too. I want to start with a story that you shared once when we were hanging out in the past and something that I'll never forget, and it's about the time that you just joined Facebook and apparently you had some kind of big presentation you had to give to the entire company or the executive staff. And then I just love the way it kind of unfolded and it kind of gives you a glimpse into what it's like to work with Zuck and at Facebook. Can you share that story if that rings a bell?

Luc Levesque (00:04:00):
If remember the story, well, basically I had just started at Facebook about... I'll use those two interchangeably. I remember it as Facebook and I always will. I was three months in and was working on a new area for me. So I came in, started putting together our thoughts on a strategy and was asked to do a presentation in front of the company with Mark on the strategy. So I whipped up a draft strategy, put together some plots and plans, presented in front of the company and went well. And then every six months there's something called the [inaudible 00:04:32] Team Review of Facebook and basically product area leads will go in and present their strategy, how it's going. Again, I just joined three months before, so I walk in no idea what to expect. I am sitting at a table. You can kind of envision it's a big room, a really big room with a bunch of tables set up in a big square with a little microphone.

Luc Levesque (00:04:50):
So I sit in there, there's Mark and all the executives sitting on the other side. And I sit down and it's quiet for what felt like five minutes. I'm sure it was not, but it was quiet for a while, just sitting there waiting for what's going to happen now. And at some point Mark kind looks over, says, "Hey, we saw your presentation, saw your strategy. Now when are we going to start seeing results?" And that was my introduction to Facebook. It was kind of my introduction to working with Mark and was a pretty kind of intense thing to go through. Again, I just joined. The strategy was very much a draft at that point, but I think what it highlights is something that Facebook does really, really well, which you get very quickly when you join Facebook and it's why they're such an execution machine and can build a lot of great product. It's because they focus exclusively on that magic word, which is impact.

Luc Levesque (00:05:44):
And that was kind of my first introduction to working with Mark and just that laser focus on, "All right, got it. Now when are we going to start seeing impact and kind of moving from there?" So it's something that is very much in the culture there and something that is so important. It's something of course that we focus on a lot at Shopify, but it's that difference between, "I don't care how hard you've worked. I don't care what you're working on, what the activities are. What are the outcomes? What is the impact you're having?" I actually really love that word impact and focusing on it because it's vague enough that it covers off any work that is impactful towards the mission and it's precise enough to know what does that mean when you say, "Are you having impact? Or what is the impact we're having?" So it's a great way to approach things. That was my first experience there within a few months. And yeah, we jumped in and started focusing on having a lot of impact from there.

Lenny (00:06:36):
I love that story. There's a couple things there. One is, if I were in your shoes, I'd poop my pants sitting there for five minutes waiting for what do you guys-

Luc Levesque (00:06:45):
That did not happen. I had a report.

Lenny (00:06:47):
Okay. How did it go? How did you deal with it? Or I guess how did you respond?

Luc Levesque (00:06:51):
Well, we had, funny enough, already started having impact, so I was able to at least respond with, "Hey, we've kind of already started in a few ways" and walk through where we were having impact and just focus on the strategy, what our plans forward were and where we wanted to go from there. So I think that's how I responded.

Lenny (00:07:08):
Okay, great work. So something I've started doing actually on this podcast is I've started to keep a little Post-it of, here it is, of themes that continue to recur across companies that are most successful. And impact comes... It's number one on my Post-it here, is just impact comes up so often as something that the best companies continue to come back to and focus on and put a lot of emphasis on. I guess I don't know what the question is exactly, but is that just what you find in the work that you do with all the companies you work with? Just how important it's to come back to impact as maybe the primary thing?

Luc Levesque (00:07:42):
Yeah, I mean I think it's easy for a lot of leaders and companies to get caught up in how hard are people working, what did they do, and recognizing and rewarding activity. I mean, everybody wants to have impact. The companies that truly focus on that are the ones that break through and really make a lot of progress towards the mission. So that seems obvious I think when I say it out loud, but being in that culture and having it really ingrained in everything you do whether it's performance reviews or strategies or these reviews with the executive team, it all gravitates around impact. And I think it's that laser focus on it that matters so much. But I mean I've certainly seen it going other ways where it's more about working long hours. And certainly there's a correlation, to be clear, between working hard and impact, but I find it's just such a precise way to think about how people are performing or what you're doing in terms of is your strategy working? Is the direction you're moving in having the intended outcomes that you want? And yeah, I do think it's all about that.

Luc Levesque (00:08:46):
Being a growth leader where everything's so measurable, impact is something that can be very clearly measured and you know whether you have it or not. So the most important thing that we work on constantly is reviewing what's our strategy, what are we working on? Is that driving towards the top level north star outcome we want? Is that having the impact? And then basically doing everything around that singular north star. So it's very, very important. I think it's more profound than it might seem just from the outside. But if you've worked in different companies, you've probably experienced different versions of this too.

Lenny (00:09:20):
Yeah. I want to spend more time on this, but before we move on, you also have another Zuck story. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Zuck recruited you personally to join Facebook/Meta. Is that true? And then if true, what was that like to be recruited by Zuck personally?

Luc Levesque (00:09:35):
It was an interesting experience, very intense, but also one of the reasons for it was I was living in Canada and my family was there and I had some strong personal reasons why I couldn't leave Canada. But yeah, we had a lot of discussions with Mark. I won't get into the micro details of it, that's more Mark's story to tell than mine. But a few takeaways from going through that experience. As a leader, hiring is the most important thing as we all know. It's a craft and a skill that I'm always working on refining. I have my own playbook that I'm constantly tweaking, testing out different approaches, trying to find the best talent and assessing them and trying to close them and bringing them on board. So I learned a lot through that experience with Mark.

Luc Levesque (00:10:15):
A couple things that stood out were the first one would be that Mark really involved the entire executive team. It wasn't just me talking to recruiting or talent or HR or just Mark, it was the entire executive team. That's something that I think a lot of leaders don't take advantage of. I've seen leaders, I've certainly done this at times where you go it alone or you're working with recruiting, but the reality is all the leaders, all the execs in the company know how important it's to bring in talent and they're always more than happy to help. So that's something that I think more leaders should do is really recruit all of their peers and their leaders in the company to help close. And that's certainly something that happened when I was in discussions with Mark and Facebook about joining.

Luc Levesque (00:10:55):
The second one, which I had I suppose never experienced before, was that they made it very personal. I had these reasons why I couldn't leave. So initially I was excited by the opportunity, but I couldn't see myself moving to California for personal reasons. And through discussions, Mark basically involved my wife, involved my spouse in this, Andrea. We flew down, had dinner with him and Priscilla, his wife. Andrea had ended up meeting with many of the executives at Facebook and really talking through what was holding us back, why we couldn't come, potential options and ideas for how we could come down.

Luc Levesque (00:11:33):
But involving somebody's spouse and family I think is a really good idea because it's a very personal decision to change company. It involves more than just that person you're talking to, it involves the whole family. So that was something that I think is an important thing to have in your kind of playbook for hiring, is really think about the whole person's family and involve them if you can. In fact, Toby did this as well at Shopify. He flew down here with Fiona and we had breakfast with Andrea and them and reviewed a few offers when I joined Shopify.

Luc Levesque (00:12:03):
And then the third thing is just to be absolutely relentless and don't give up and don't let momentum drop. It took seven months for me to go from, "This is amazing, exciting, but there's no way I can make this work" to, "Okay, let's move to Palo Alto." And Mark, the execs, a variety of leaders there were in discussions for months and months and months and never letting the momentum die. That's something that I think is really important. No doesn't necessarily mean no, and in this case it definitely wasn't the case. I had the same experience with Toby at Shopify where we've been talking about working together for over 10 years now. And then finally the timing was right and I was able to join the company.

Luc Levesque (00:12:45):
So just be relentless, involve the family, involve the spouse if you can, and recruit some help from other executives in the company. Those were some of the things that stood out through my experience. But yeah, it was a pretty wild time in my life.

Lenny (00:13:00):
Relentless is actually another word. I wasn't necessarily I'm supposed to yet, but I feel like it's another trend to cross. The most impactful and successful founders is just this like, "I will not give up. I will keep at it."

Luc Levesque (00:13:09):
[inaudible 00:13:10].

Lenny (00:13:10):
And so that's a really interesting example of that in action. I was going to talk about this later, but maybe it's a good time to talk about it now, which is around hiring. So you talked about you have this playbook for how to hire. You mentioned to me that you kind of find that as you scale as a leader, hiring ends up being like the most important skill maybe, maybe one of the most important skills. I'd love to hear your take on just what you found about hiring as you've grown as a product leader.

Luc Levesque (00:13:33):
Well, I think you reach a point in your career where you realize that hiring is the skill you now need to become world-class at because you're not no longer doing the work yourself. You're still of course involved and doing some of the work and getting your hands dirty, but the bulk of your team's success now will be the quality of the hires you make and you truly need to be world-class at that. So yeah, I built this playbook out. I was in Canada in Ottawa when I sold that company, Tripadvisor, and really started growing my team and becoming more Leaning into leadership at the time through that experience.

Luc Levesque (00:14:07):
One of the benefits of being in Ottawa and kind of off the grid if you will, is it's a curse and a benefit as that you don't have a ton of people you can learn from. So it does mean you need to go to first principles and think things through from the ground up. It takes a little longer, but you come up with your own playbooks on how to do things. I think you've seen my blueprint, which is a good example of that where I have this blueprint I put together. When new people join the team, I show them my blueprint, which is basically a list of my quirks so we can really quickly align. That's something that just being in Ottawa and trying to figure out how to be a leader and avoid mistakes, I was like, "Wouldn't it be nice if you had a blueprint? When somebody joined, you can just tell them all of your quirks and you can just quickly calibrate on how it is to work together versus through awkward long discussions over the course of a year."

Luc Levesque (00:14:51):
My hiring playbook's a similar thing. I think of it in three different chapters, if you will. There's finding talent, assessing talent, and closing talent. In terms of finding talent, I do believe that the best predictor of future performance is past performance. So I'm looking for what I call signs of excellence. So I want to know the top people generally have done multiple amazing things in their life, repeated success, not just once. Maybe it was work related, maybe not work related. But generally speaking, if you think back to the stars you've worked with, they've done some amazing things. And that's why I always start when I interview or when I chat with people, I started talking about just trying to understand, "What has been your path? What have you done professionally and not professionally?" And generally, stars going to stand out. It's very rare that there's not something obvious that comes through.

Luc Levesque (00:15:39):
So for myself personally, I'm looking for kind of three different signs of excellence to tell me that it doesn't have to be three. The mental model I have is as you're talking to them, you're getting pluses and negatives. There's red flags you're hearing and there's really great things. And then at the end you can make an opinion of how good this person is.

Luc Levesque (00:15:56):
Another great sign of excellence, and this was just through reflecting on stars on the team and thinking what makes them unique, what about them. One of them is when somebody's boss leaves the company and then comes back to poach them, that is such a strong signal because if you think of what just happened, the leader who knows exactly how good this person you're talking to is, they have the most knowledge of the performance of this individual, they left the company. They've come back to poach them, putting their own reputation at risk by coming back depending on the situation. And they would never do that unless this person was really, really good.

Luc Levesque (00:16:37):
So you don't want to over pivot on one signal, you want to look at the full picture. But those are the types of things I look at to bring in top talent. And I've got this whole playbook, mistakes I've made that I've learned from, things to avoid. And over the years, yeah, I've put together this playbook that I try to follow and I'm always running little experiments to try to make it better.

Lenny (00:16:56):
Were going to that blueprint that you mentioned. A lot of which you're talking about is probably more relevant to senior executive type people because you're looking for... Or maybe not because you're looking for say three.

Luc Levesque (00:17:06):
[inaudible 00:17:06].

Lenny (00:17:06):
Okay. So people early in their career could also have three, say, moments of excellence?

Luc Levesque (00:17:12):
Yeah, I mean just thinking off the top, it depends on the type of person you're hiring, but are they a founder? Have they tried to do something? Did they win an award somewhere? Are they a gold medalist at something? Have they done something that others have not that shows grit, that shows drive, that shows the ability to succeed? And I've seen that you can apply that to any candidate you're hiring.

Lenny (00:17:36):
The implication there is, without that, they're probably not going to be stars, that there's a strong correlation between having signs of excellence and them performing really well in this role.

Luc Levesque (00:17:45):
Correct, exactly. Yeah, I mean I suppose it's possible, but it would be pretty rare that somebody would come in without some sign that they stand above the crowd. And again, I'm talking about you generally want to hire the top 1% of candidates. So when you're looking for the best of the best, you definitely are looking for those signals.

Lenny (00:18:01):
Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to bring us back on the agenda that I had for myself, which is I want to start with talking about advisorships and advising and growth advisors. You've been a growth advisor for a long time to some of the most amazing companies out there, Twitter, Pinterest, Patreon, Canva, Thumbtack. I'm sure there's others that you don't list that are more informal. Now you work at Shopify. And so what I think about here is a lot of founders often think about, "Should I bring on an advisor? What should I look for an advisor? I've heard stories of advisors being useless sometimes. People tell me I don't need advisors." So I guess the question here is just what's your take on when it makes sense to bring on and consider bringing on a growth advisor and what should people look for when they're exploring and talking to a potential growth advisor?

Luc Levesque (00:18:47):
A few thoughts. In terms of when, I don't think you can probably come into early. It's probably harder to find really good ones than it is to time it. But generally speaking, I would say you don't want to focus too much on growth until you have product market fit. So make sure you have a product that users love that's either showing strong signs of retention or has some good loop that you can see that you can start thinking about growth.

Lenny (00:19:08):
Let me follow on that thread real quick because I find some founders still want to have someone come help them with growth even though they know they don't have product market fit, even though this tip comes up every single time when I'm talking to growth person, like, "Wait till you have product market fit before doing growth stuff." So could you just add a little bit of why that's important while we're on that topic?

Luc Levesque (00:19:27):
Growth advice is generally always applicable. And if you can start thinking about how to build your product early, even if it's pre-product market fit, you're not going to do any damage, but you may be wasting some capital on an advisor or a growth person too early. The problem that I see is if you start growing a product that doesn't have product market fit, you're actually doing more damage than good because you have a product that is now being exposed to the market through growth levers and through optimization that is giving a bad experience with your product. And you want that product that you know is tight and you know has product market fit to start building the flywheel and start growing. You don't want it to be growing if it doesn't satisfy that need that you're trying to build out for. So I can see it having more damage than good because when somebody tries something, they're unlikely to try it again. And so that's the dangerous game you can get into. So you're better off with a good product that's satisfying a need and then growing from there.

Luc Levesque (00:20:20):
I will say to kind of play devil's advocate with myself and something that I've done actually in one of the products, I've built several consumer products and grown them, is that sometimes to know if you have a product, you need users to use it. So there's like some subtlety in here, but I would say if you are trying to get users in to start playing with it at scale, I mean try to focus in on a market that is maybe off the grid. Like pick some English-speaking country that's a bit off the grid that you can isolate your marketing to so you can start getting dozens or a couple hundred people per day coming in and giving you feedback.

Luc Levesque (00:20:58):
I've seen that work too. So I'd say wait till you have product market fit. If you do start growing your product early because you need that signal from people actually using it beyond just focus groups and friends or small numbers of people, try to do it off the grid in smaller markets that you can get kind of contain the growth and get what you're really trying to get, which is that signal on is it working or not.

Lenny (00:21:19):
Awesome. Okay, I threw us off track. Let's get back on track. So we're talking about when it makes sense to find a growth advisor and then what to look for and so on that you might want to work with.

Luc Levesque (00:21:27):
I mean, what makes a great growth advisor is somebody who really understands what to do but also why certain growth levers work. It's that kind of deep understanding of levers of onboarding or whatever area they're focusing on that really makes growth advisor stand out. So when you're looking for a growth advisor, you want to have those discussions to see like, "How much depth does this person have? Have they seen a playbook and they're just good at repeating the playbook or are they evolving, are they growing?" The best way to get to know that is to start really asking them questions about growth and growth advising and the certain things that they've done and why they think those have worked.

Luc Levesque (00:22:09):
This can be tricky if you don't yourself know growth. So I think one thing that I have not seen a lot of founders do that I would advise is if you have an advisor already... Because this applies to finding growth advisors, but it also applies to hiring good growth talent. So if you have somebody you know whether it's already an advisor or somebody who knows growth, you can solicit their help in trying to flesh out whether somebody you're trying to hire is of high talent. So if you have an advisor, you can make that one of their roles is vet out any new talent coming in. And if you're looking for an advisor, try to find somebody that you know and trust who can do that first pass. Because for somebody who knows growth that you trust, it's actually not a lot of work for them to vet out how talented someone else's. It's an easy ask to make and something that if you have that person in your network or that worked with you that you can leverage for.

Luc Levesque (00:23:01):
But I haven't seen that too often where founders kind of take advantage of people they know or existing growth advisors to help recruit and vet talent because it can be quite hard if you don't know the growth space to know if somebody's good or not.

Lenny (00:23:15):
That's a really interesting idea and it could be where you find someone that's too busy to work with you, but maybe you could just ask, "Hey, could you just easily help me vet people?" And it takes a lot less time.

Luc Levesque (00:23:26):
Yeah, I've never been asked that, which is, I mean I don't know if I'll start getting asked this now, but it does seem like that's a really simple way to add a ton of value. And as a founder, I mean even if you have to pay this person or whatever you have to do, but it's such an important hire to get right. We talk about the 10X engineer and we don't really talk about the 10X growth advisor or 10X growth person, but the same dynamic applies. You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact where they're either building or helping to ideate or helping to implement a growth loop that literally changes the company. As we know, you need a great product and you need a great growth loop. And it's usually just one loop that you need to get right. Most companies have gotten to where they are just off of one really strong channel that they've just dominated, so it's important to get right.

Lenny (00:24:17):
Is there an example of that sort of impact that you've seen in your advisorship or other people's of just an impact from one conversation or a little bit of a help?

Luc Levesque (00:24:25):
Definitely. And I think what I would point to is the advantage of a growth advisor is it takes a long time to understand a channel. Certainly people have to know their stuff, they have to be very good at their craft, their growth craft, but also they have to be exposed to a large set of experiments or an environment where they've just seen what works and what doesn't. So no matter how good somebody is, if they haven't been exposed to an environment where there's a lot of experimentation, a lot of learning, it's very hard for them to internalize that. So once a growth advisor has that, it's takes years to learn it, but it literally can take seconds literally to communicate that. So I've worked with some companies that you've mentioned and certainly have had impact very quickly.

Luc Levesque (00:25:09):
I mean, one example would be a company that I worked with. Now, a public company. At the time, they weren't. On day one, walked in, they presented their strategy, their plans, their funnels and their landing pages. I could see very quickly that there was something they were doing that was a little off and I asked them, "Well, why are you doing it that way?" And they said, "Well, we think it just looks better that way." And I said, "Well, just do it this other way." I remember this because it was such a short conversation and then three weeks later we connected and I heard they had rolled it out and it was a large impact that they had from this one change. This has happened many times with the companies I've worked with, but it's a good example that once you know it, it's not hard to recognize it if you deeply understand it to give advice, but it takes a long time to get the base knowledge.

Luc Levesque (00:26:02):
So I don't do these too often anymore, but when I do advise, I take them very seriously. I focus exclusively on having impact. I think that's really important because like you say, there's a lot of advisors out there. Some of them are great, some of them different qualities, and you really want to make sure that if you are an advisor, you want to be in the camp of when this person comes in, they have a lot of impact and it takes time and focus and energy and alignment and there's a bunch of things we can talk about that that helps to drive that alignment. But having impact is the most important thing, whether you're an advisor or if you're hiring because it's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.

Lenny (00:26:49):
There's that word impact again,

Luc Levesque (00:26:51):
Impact. Impact.

Lenny (00:26:52):
The point you just made about how one conversation can have a ton of impact is a reminder of why sometimes the price of an advisor feels absurd where like, "For one hour it's like thousands of dollars," but it's because obviously they spent a decade learning a thing and one conversation is all of that work they put into it crystallized for you in the moment.

Luc Levesque (00:27:13):
Exactly. It's something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, "Okay, here's the needle in the haystack" and then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's exhilarating. It's great. I have something I used to say, which is, you want your impact to be so big there's a slide in the next board deck on try to explain what happened. That can happen when you are advising companies because you're able to share a very quickly insights. But one way to drive alignment is not everybody can do this, not all advisors do it this way, but I personally love just when I do these, which is not that frequent, just purely doing equity because I love the alignment in outcomes where the founder will be successful and you will be successful. So the incentives are really good to drive the right performance and the right outcomes that you want as a founder.

Luc Levesque (00:28:09):
So if you can do it, I would definitely advise founders to bring advisors in for equity if you can. I think the same applies for your internal growth team. You want to make sure that the teams are incentivized not on activities, on doing stuff, because there's a lot of stuff to be done in growth, but really driving the outcomes that you want. And equity's just a great way of saying, "Hey, we're in this together. We're on the same side of the table. Let's go grow this company."

Lenny (00:28:36):
I was actually about to ask you what kind of structure you recommend for an advisorship. Is there anything else you can share about just what you'd recommend a founder do in terms of compensation for an advisor?

Luc Levesque (00:28:45):
There's a couple things. I'm a big fan of equity because of the alignment of incentives. You should think about, without getting into too much detail of the actual structure of the deals, but think about how you vest the equity. The last thing you want is an advisor holding back on sharing knowledge. The ideal engagement would be an advisor comes in, delivers as much value as possible quickly, and then trains your team. And then maybe it's a one-year engagement and hopefully they've learned because the advisor has been incentivized to share as much as possible and to train the team as much as possible. And then ideally you don't need them anymore after. So there's something there about structuring equity vesting. I'm a big fan of vesting earlier rather than later. So think about in terms of structure you're vesting, commensurate with the value you want, which is very much front loaded.

Luc Levesque (00:29:35):
I'm also a big fan of three month cliffs. Something I've done, I always do actually, is listen, in the first three months you'll know both sides if it's working or not. And you want to de-risk that on both sides because it really should be seen as a partnership between the advisor and the founder. If the founder thinks you're not adding value in the first few months, I think they should just tear it up and both sides move on. It's not good for the founder to continue the deal and it's not good frankly for the advisor because they're not, for some reason, able to add value in that environment. So I love a three-month cliff at the beginning where if it's not working in the first three months, you tear up the deal and both parties walk away and de-risk the entire thing, and again, drives incentives in the right way where the advisor is 100% incentivized at as much value as fast as possible. And so that's another thing that I tend to do and I've done it for a long time.

Lenny (00:30:28):
That's a really good tip. Basically don't do it for a year if you're vesting for advisors, probably not even to a year, but yeah.

Luc Levesque (00:30:33):
There's a bunch of ways to do it. Honestly, it's hard enough to find growth advisors that have capacity, so you got to also say like, "What can you do that the advisor's comfortable with?" But yeah, I mean just to be candid, I think you want to structure in a way where you're not dependent on the advisor over time. They're adding a ton of value, they're helping teach the team, they're probably bouncing around because your company's changing, your team's changing, your leaders are changing. But over time, and that can be years, but it shouldn't be indefinite. You shouldn't need an advisor forever.

Luc Levesque (00:31:04):
I've seen a scenario where there's desire to keep the advisor on almost as insurance, like, "If something goes wrong, I just wanted to be able to pick up the phone." That can make sense. But I do think a good growth advisor is incentivized to share as much as possible, as fast as possible to have impact to train your team. And then whether you want to keep them on or not long term as an insurance policy or just to answer questions as things change, that should be a choice and not because, "If we lose the advisor. We're completely screwed." That would be a bad place for you to be in as a founder.

Lenny (00:31:35):
You said it's hard to find a good advisor, 100% agree. Any advice for people to help them find an advisor that might be the right fit?

Luc Levesque (00:31:43):
Yeah, I would say there's more of them these days than there were even just five years ago or 10 years ago. Depending on your situation, if you're a founder, I would start with your investors. I think VCs have an amazing network of advisors. I get, I don't know, a couple requests a week that I'm not taking right now. But that from my experience and what I've seen, that's probably especially the high end VCs, the very talented VCs will have this network. And frankly, it's a great partnership as an advisor for you to have. You can help the companies, you can help the VCs and it helps you. So everybody wins, just asking other founders that had good experience, much like hiring.

Luc Levesque (00:32:21):
The third advice I would give is to find companies that are world-class at what you're trying to grow, what channel or skill you're looking at, and then reach out and see if there's a way to help that way. That's actually how I got started. I was at Tripadvisor and a prominent VC reached out. One of the companies they were working with needed some help on SEO. I was still in Canada at the time, got connected with them, had a phone call, had a significant impact through that one phone call. And rather than joining as an advisor, I essentially helped them out pro bono in exchange for, "Hey, I want to get connected in the Valley." So I was in Canada, I wanted to start another company, I wanted to get connected. So through that tactic where they reached out to a company that was known to be world-class at SEO, I think that was really smart on this VC's part.

Luc Levesque (00:33:13):
And then maybe some advice to up and coming growth advisors would be that first one, I didn't take a single shred of equity or money and just tried to have as much impact as possible and to help out this company as much as possible and then make sure that I was able to get connected to other people that I wanted to meet in the Bay Area. And then kind of things snowballed from there.

Lenny (00:33:33):
I definitely want to chat about how to become a growth advisor because I think people listening here might be like, "Oh, that sounds pretty good. Someday maybe I'll become a growth advisor." But before we get to that, what are things that an advisor are best suited for versus finding someone full-time versus no one? What are the ideal kind of problem sets for an advisor versus say, full-time hire person?

Luc Levesque (00:33:57):
I would say your preference should always be to have somebody in-house. I'll start there because you want to have that as part of the culture. There's so much more that they can do when they're in-house. That being said, if you can't find somebody in-house, then bring on an advisor... Even if you bring on an advisor, some advice to founders would be you want to surround your team or at least one person that you've identified who's just a amazing world-class doer, even if they don't know growth, with a set of growth advisors so that they're learning, that's being put through the culture of the company and that knowledge stays inside of the company. So I'd say I would prefer to go internal, surround these people with great advisors and then take it from there. That would be how I approach it.

Lenny (00:34:41):
Okay. So two thoughts here. One is I feel like this podcast is becoming an interesting way to discover awesome growth advisors. I think over time I'm building this directory of who are awesome, smart growth people that are open to advising. So that could be an interesting opportunity to just look through the folks on this podcast and-

Luc Levesque (00:34:59):
Yep, there's some great people that have been on here. Definitely.

Lenny (00:35:02):
Totally working my way through all the amazing least smart growth people and product leaders. The other is I've noticed they're a lot of the best growth advisors have worked with the same sorts of companies. I find Miro comes up a lot, Canva comes up a lot, Pinterest. All these people that have worked with say Pinterest that I hear about are just awesome. Casey comes to mind, Melissa Tan who's coming out with a podcast, I think she worked with them. Dropbox. Anyway, so maybe one idea, see who these companies work with as advisors and that can maybe point you to people that are worth exploring.

Luc Levesque (00:35:34):
I mean, that's a good idea. It kind of goes back to something I mentioned earlier, which is companies that have a lot of traffic and that have a lot of users are a great learning ground for growth people and for advisors, because no matter how smart you are, you need the reps. You got to go to the growth gym and put in the reps, which is experiments. You've got to try things, things that are going to work, things that aren't going to work. There's a discipline of when something doesn't work, you can learn almost as much as when something works. But you need that traffic, you need that environment. And that's why certain companies have these great people coming out like Casey at Pinterest and other people that have been at these companies that have the traffic, have the culture to support it, to support growth. I don't think that's a coincidence why some of these companies have some great people coming from them.

Lenny (00:36:20):
The other tip I just thought about as you were talking is everyone's launching a Substack newsletter that is doing any sort of advising because there's a lot of power in building an audience and creating kind of awareness of what you do. So I wonder if another tip is search Substack's directory of newsletters for specific things you're dealing with, like say, go to PLG or sales and you might find someone there."

Luc Levesque (00:36:39):
I haven't done that, but that seems like a reasonable way to do it.

Lenny (00:36:42):
That's where we're all heading.

Luc Levesque (00:36:44):
I'm not saying that the people on Substack have this. But as advice to the people listening, is when you're vetting for a growth advisor or growth talent, don't just wait it on the public halo of somebody. That's a common mistake I've seen where maybe somebody's done presentations at a conference or somebody's done... I don't know, but their Twitter following is broad. They can be excellent. That's not a disqualifier immediately, but just make sure not to make the hire just exclusively on that. I've made that mistake a few times and it's a common one to get into. So make sure you're vetting properly, even if somebody with a large following on Substack or Twitter. That's I think an important thing to keep in mind.

Lenny (00:37:25):
1000% agree. I always say that the best product leader is the best growth. People don't have time to sit on Twitter and tweet and write newsletters. They're doing the job, working, building, growing, and maybe eventually they get out of that and start writing. But I 1000% agree, there's a lot of people-

Luc Levesque (00:37:40):
Well, not to disqualify all the people on Twitter.

Lenny (00:37:43):
Absolutely.

Luc Levesque (00:37:43):
Some of them are tweeting [inaudible 00:37:45], but my point is just don't over pivot on the halo. Just look at their past performance. What teams have they been on? What environment do they have? Do they really know growth? And sometimes they do, but I think it's a common mistake to say, "Oh yeah, they have a large following, let's hire this person." That's poorly.

Lenny (00:38:03):
1000% agree. Rarely does a celebrity hire that seems really genius on Twitter and Substack end up being as amazing as you think.

Luc Levesque (00:38:12):
Yeah, it does happen, but yeah.

Lenny (00:38:13):
It does happen. Absolutely. One last question around this topic. People listening might want to become growth advisors, I'd mentioned this earlier. Is there any other advice you want to share? Just like, "If you want to become a growth advisor someday, here's what you should think about."

Luc Levesque (00:38:26):
Yeah, I think the right mental model as a growth advisor is around the same one as an investor. So the most important thing an advisor can do aside from having impact and knowing their craft is picking which companies to work with, especially if you're working for equity. So I'll only speak to that, but you're basically putting in your time, you're picking likely a smaller number. You only have so many hours in the day of companies to work with and you want to make sure there's a likely exit in the future. So for me personally, I have a spreadsheet, like most big decisions that I make in my life. Over the years I've just added criteria and questions to ask myself about the company and then reflect on, "Okay, is this kind of checking all the boxes for a likely outcome?" Because you don't just need to be successful, you need to be successful and for the company to be successful and for there to be liquidity of that.

Luc Levesque (00:39:17):
So you need to put yourself in the shoes of an investor and look at it as an investment. That is arguably the most important thing because you can go and do a great job and then wait many years and potentially not see any reward for it. And I think that's the nice thing about the equity structure in that you're tied in the same incentives with the founder, which is just great in terms of any relationship to have the same incentives, but you want to make sure that there's a good likelihood of a decent outcome down the road.

Luc Levesque (00:39:49):
If I can throw another one in.

Lenny (00:39:49):
Yeah, absolutely.

Luc Levesque (00:39:50):
The other piece of advice I would give is it can take a long time for some of these companies to be successful. That's okay. You should expect that. In fact, you should just go in with that mindset. When I'm deciding to work with a company, I'm in there for 10 years and I know that and I say that. And I say, "I'm in. We're in this together if I choose to work with the company." But it does mean that the structure of the deal needs to reflect that. So you need to have a long tail at the end.

Luc Levesque (00:40:15):
So if you're taking options or RSUs and it's pure of the equity, make sure you have the time for that to happen. There would be nothing worse than putting your heart and soul having impact and then waiting, I don't know, a couple years and then your equity expires. So you make sure there's a long tail. I mean, it can literally take over 10 years for these companies to exit. And you should be okay with that. I think that's okay. You're taking some risks. They're taking some risk on you and that's a great partnership, but you'll just need the time for that. So advice to growth advisors, make sure to ask for a long tail so that you don't end up in a bad spot in the end. And that incentives, again, are perfectly aligned between the founder and the advisor.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is the next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:41:59):
So I want to segue to a different topic, SEO. You're kind of the... You tell me, but it feels like you're one of the earliest SEO people in tech. You helped grow Tripadvisor many years ago and it was mostly SEO-driven. I think you innovated a lot of SEO tactics and strategies. And then you helped Pinterest, Thumbtack, other companies that are very SEO-driven. You talked about how many companies grow through one channel and these are all very SEO-driven companies. I imagine Shopify has a lot of SEO work that's happening right now with you there. And so I want to chat about SEO. So I guess broadly SEO is like... It's like this amazing growth channel. It's basically free. It continues to work after you stop doing any work on it for a while. Many founders think about, "Should we invest in SEO? How do we approach SEO?" So maybe just as a first question, what are signs that your product and company is a good fit for SEO being potentially a huge channel for growth?

Luc Levesque (00:42:55):
Yeah, I've been doing SEO for a really long time. It's a lot of fun and certainly being a supervisor was a great learning ground for that, that we were able to really innovate and try new things there. In terms of the playbook that we built out. That was a lot of fun, those years.

Luc Levesque (00:43:11):
Couple thoughts. The first one would be I do think there's an SEO play in any company. Maybe at a different extent, but Google is such a large funnel of existing demand for your product or your product area that there's usually an angle to get some SEO traffic there. So I do think it applies to most companies. I would say if you're an early product that the world's never seen, it's a brand new thing, there might be some creation, some demand creation you need to do, but most of the time there's existing demand in Google where you can harvest demand or there's queries that are related to your topic that you can start ranking for to start building brand awareness. So there's always some angle.

Luc Levesque (00:43:52):
And then I kind of divide websites or online products into two categories. There's the ones which are smaller sites, small number of pages, very targeted at your product and don't have this kind of loop of creating new pages automatically. Most eCommerce sites actually have would a number of pages around the products and about us, those types of pages. That's one type of sites. Let's say they have dozen pages. And then there's other ones with thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of pages which are either user generated content like Tripadvisor and Pinterest and others, or marketplaces like Thumbtack and other types of websites like that. Those are generally easier to see a huge amount of impact very quickly because there's such a large optimization surface and ideally it's growing and generating traffic automatically.

Luc Levesque (00:44:40):
I've always thought of LinkedIn as just such a great example of this where you have this viral loop where if you recall when it was just starting, everybody was getting these invites from LinkedIn. Those come and go. You get an invite, you register, you don't. That happens. But the byproduct is when people join, they create this beautiful lightning page, which is your profile that gets indexed. It's kind of like a viral loop feeding an SEO loop that continues to grow. So that's a good example of use generated content which kind of feeds on itself and grows. So there's those two categories. Going back to the first category, if you only have a small handful of pages, the way to think about that is you certainly want to optimize those pages, then you want to start creating content that speaks to your audience beyond that. So you need a content strategy, whether it's a blog or creating new parts of your site that address questions that your audience might have. But generally speaking, I think there's an SEO play in any company and there's just different tactics, strategies, and approaches to get there.

Lenny (00:45:40):
Awesome. I never thought of it that way, that there's kind of these two buckets. So the first bucket is like you don't have a ton of pages that naturally are generated as a part of your experience. And the second is you do. I guess in the second bucket I think of Reddit and Glassdoor and Quora, Tripadvisor, a great example, Pinterest. In the first bucket is the way to generate pages. Basically, it's editorially write content and have people write things for you. Is that generally the strategy?

Luc Levesque (00:46:07):
There's different ways of doing it, but a good content strategy is a kind of tried and true approach. Definitely.

Lenny (00:46:13):
And in that bucket of you don't naturally have a ton of pages, can you primarily grow through SEO? Or is SEO always going to be this minority channel and you have to find something else?

Luc Levesque (00:46:24):
No, it can be a big channel. This is also about creating content, but it's not your users creating the content. You have to go create the content and have some high quality answer to a question that's being asked on Google. I think one thing to keep in mind with SEO is entire industries are based off of single keywords. I remember when I was in the travel industry that literally companies were bought and sold based on one keyword rank. So it's not like, "Oh, it's a little bit of traffic." And I think this is a bit unintuitive with growth. A lot of people, they'll think of growth as linear or it's another channel, it's another thing. I mean, growth done right is exponential. It literally is company changing.

Luc Levesque (00:47:00):
When you're talking specifically about SEO, keep in mind the world is searching for that thing, targeted on that one keyword and likely you're clicking the number one search result. So getting that number one spot is not like, "Oh, that's a little bit of traffic." You can literally build an entire business around that first spot. So don't think that's... Well, maybe it is commonly known, I'm not sure, but it's definitely something that is non-obvious or intuitive I think to most people. And if you have an entire SEO team working on one keyword, I don't think that's crazy because a small number of keywords can define an entire industry or a business.

Lenny (00:47:37):
Is there an example of that sort of situation when keyword's building a massive company?

Luc Levesque (00:47:41):
Yeah, I mean there's a lot I'm sure. I can speak to my own company that I sold to Tripadvisor. It was called TravelPod. It was a travel blogging website where you can think WordPress, but for travel, which I started earlier. It was the first site to do that. I made the mistake of not knowing SEO or growth before I sold the company. And so that was a great learning for me. When I went in, this is a story where we're looking to acquire another site and I thought the product was pretty poor. I remember talking to the founder and thinking... He'd asked me if we'd want to acquire it, and, "The product's terrible. Why would I want to acquire that?" He's like, "Yeah, they're 10 times bigger than you." And, "What?" That was when I realized, "Okay, we've been building a great product and great engineering culture and it is important, but you really need to know this growth stuff." So that's actually the moment I shifted to, "All right, we have to really know these growth levers."

Luc Levesque (00:48:34):
In that space, the number one keyword was Travel Blog. And so owning that was a big deal and we did not own it. I think we ranked number two for a really long time. I can't remember if we got it in the end, but that's just one example where... And there was many, many travel businesses where I always loved looking at a business and trying to figure out, "What's their growth loop? How did they do that?" And it's not like, "Oh, it's a great business. It just grew." Most of the time it's price line crushed it at SEM. Facebook crushed it at a viral loop where you got tagged in a photo, you got an email and you had to go register because there's a photo of you somewhere you really want to see. Tripadvisor did a great job at SEO. In [inaudible 00:49:14], it's just one really strong channel that propelled the company forward. And in this case, it can literally come down to one keyword like we had at TravelPod.

Lenny (00:49:20):
So maybe it's a good time just to give a people a mental model of the different channels/loops that exist. So you've talked about SEO is one, paid search is one. What's the collection for people to think about? Usually as you said, one of the use is the primary source of growth for a company.

Luc Levesque (00:49:38):
Yeah, there's a variety of them. I think you have to look at where the intent is right now. It does change over time, but you have social channels like TikTok, Instagram. Influencers are a great area to engage with there. You have SEO, you have search. I think ChatGPT is another upcoming one that we might want to talk about a little bit where I do think we've never seen that kind of growth for search before and that's a platform that we have to start thinking about how do we optimize for it. Google just announced there are recent changes. They're going to be putting in an AI box at the top, the searchers also, how do you optimize in a world where it's not so much about optimizing for the platform, but teaching the AI what you do and why you're the best in the world at it. So that's another whole area that we could talk about, but that's a big channel I think that that's growing.

Luc Levesque (00:50:29):
Viral loops are always a powerful thing if you can get them to work. That's more about psychology and channel optimization, where you want people to be incentivized to share the product that you have with their friends and then to have their friends come back and register. So you can have one viral loop, you can have secondary viral loops, you can bolt viral loops on your existing products. There's different ways of doing this. And then just backing up. When I think about growth, I don't think about a specific... It's not growth equals SEO and Instagram. For me, growth equals whatever it takes to move the needle. So I get this question all the time, "How do you build a growth team? What does a growth team do?" And I say whatever it takes. That could be zero to one building a new product. It could be M&A, it could be SEO, it could be social, it could be onboarding.

Luc Levesque (00:51:15):
I think that's a better framework to look at. And then if you look at it through that lens, then partnerships easily folds into that where I've seen a lot of businesses get very big on just really clever partnerships, either strategic or broad kind of affiliate based partnerships. So there's a lot of channels. I definitely wouldn't restrict the scope of a growth team to just a small subset, but have a very wide funnel or at least strategy in terms of just test a lot of different things and go after the channels that work and pivot when it does, and then really lean into the one or two or three that really work because sometimes that's all it takes for business.

Lenny (00:51:50):
Well, you definitely nerd sniped me with the ChatGPT, so let's just spend some time there. I think this relates to just the general sense that SEO is always changing and it feels like this is an SEM I guess in this case too. And ChatGPT and Bard, I guess, is maybe the latest change. So what should we know there?

Luc Levesque (00:52:05):
Yeah, I think we're all still trying to figure it out. I was at Google IO last week or the week before. As soon as I saw the search result with the big box of AI, answers at the top, having done this for so long, I immediately knew the impact that I think is about to come. I've seen this play out in travel where Google acquired ITA and did flight search and hotel search. Generally, it's great for users and great for Google and the search engines, but makes it a little bit difficult for the publishers and the sites that are adding value to the ecosystem through being ranked in search results.

Luc Levesque (00:52:42):
So what we're about to see is basically Google, what they showed was a big box on top of the search results that answers the query directly. So if you think about that, that means that there's a lot of queries right now that users are clicking through down on the organic links and getting their answer there, which will be answered directly in the search result. We've seen this play out over the last five to 10 years where more and more answers are being shown at the top. Every time something changes, entire industries are disrupted or are changed. And I think that's going to happen again.

Luc Levesque (00:53:14):
So there's different types of keywords. There's transactional ones like e-commerce keywords with purchase intent. There's navigational ones where you're trying to get somewhere. And there's informational keywords, which is, "I have a question. I'm looking for an answer." It's pretty broad. It's a big area. I think that last category of keywords is particularly at risk. So if anybody listening to this is currently getting traffic on those, you should start thinking about what does that mean when things start changing. And I think the changes will be... We'll probably start seeing things shift to paid. You have to pay for that free traffic.

Luc Levesque (00:53:47):
The second one is there may just be a case where those keywords just don't get many clicks anymore. You might drop down to a very small number of clicks, if at all, because questions will get answered directly in the search results. So it's a big shift. We have to see how things land, but that's, I think over the next 12 to 24 months, if history repeats itself, we'll see that channel change. We've seen this play out in all the different channels. They kind of evolve generally. You can't blame the companies are doing what they have to do. ChatGPT is now 50% of my daily searches and not Google. So I think Google has to react and this is what we'll see. So from a growth perspective, definitely something to start to think about.

Lenny (00:54:25):
Super fascinating. I think about my newsletter and now Google suck it all up and just tell you all the answers. Great. Good news for me.

Luc Levesque (00:54:33):
[inaudible 00:54:34].

Lenny (00:54:39):
Yeah. Yeah. And change is great. Things don't-

Luc Levesque (00:54:41):
It's exciting. It's exciting. I'm just geeking out on growth a little bit, we haven't had a big platform change in a long time. So I'm like, "All right, cool. Let's go see what we can do here. How do you optimize this? How do you get listed if you can?" We're not sure where the placements will be, but that will be the new game.

Lenny (00:54:58):
Yeah, there's actually a lennybot.com that is a GPT bot trained on my content that there's a newsletter post about how it was all built so you could build your own. And so I think my new goal is going to have to convince people to go to lennybot.com instead of Google. Wish me luck.

Luc Levesque (00:55:15):
Hey, you got to lean into it. Yeah, we have a shop.ai, this great AI-based shopping engine. And I'll tell you, I bought so much on it. It's so good. The more you use these technologies, the more you realize how good they are. And that's something biggest coming. It's not just, "Oh yeah, there's another change." I was summarizing the Google change is to some people and originally was thinking this is the biggest change in the last 10 years. And then when I reflected on the last 10 years, I thought this is actually the biggest change since the inception of Google actually. I don't think we've seen something as profound as what's coming. And you really need to get ready for it.

Lenny (00:55:52):
Yeah, I've been using ChatGPT for helping me with interview questions actually, and once in a while there's like a really good one.

Luc Levesque (00:55:59):
Oh, that's cool.

Lenny (00:56:00):
So thank you ChatGPT, bringing me good things also. Maybe one more question along these lines around kind of connecting advisorship in SEO. Would you suggest when you're starting to think about SEO, starting to invest in SEO, you might be listening to this feeling like, "I got to think about SEO," does it make sense to bring on, say, SEO advisor like you? I know you're not available currently, but other folks like you or are an agency that is really good at this stuff or bring on someone full time? Do you have any kind of frameworks for thinking about which direction to go?

Luc Levesque (00:56:30):
It's hard for an agency or a pure advisor without internal help to do a really good job without internal talent at the center. So I would say I would start with just hire somebody internally and give them the mandate and incentivize them correctly to go and own this channel. Even if they don't know SEO, my advice would be get an engineer, get somebody who is just a relentless doer who wants to learn this and surround them with great advisors that I've just seen that work really well.

Luc Levesque (00:56:59):
There are some good agencies out there. Agencies will be working with multiple companies, so it's a little bit harder to get the same impact from an agency. It can work sometimes. But my preference is generally a last resort would be an agency. And I'd much rather have somebody who's internal who knows the business, who knows the keywords, who can have the knowledge internally inside the company permanently and help grow a team around them and have succession in place and a proper team so that you're not too dependent on this one person. But that would be my go-to. And then if you're really stuck, you can use agencies, but my default would be having somebody internal supplemented with agencies if you have to. Sorry, SEO is very specific. I mean, it's a very tight channel that knowing certain things about it can have a big impact. I think you do want people that have that experience that can bring that in from the outside to augmenting internal teams. It'll take a really long time to learn it.

Lenny (00:58:01):
Awesome. I was going to ask that. So you ideally want to find someone that's done it before that isn't just a relentless learner, but is that plus, has done SEO in the past?

Luc Levesque (00:58:08):
Oh, yeah. Ideally, you hire an amazing SEO person who can bring internal. Second would be somebody amazing who can get things done, surround them with advisors. And then in my stack rank, the third would be agencies.

Lenny (00:58:20):
Awesome. And then the other kind of common issue with SEOs, it takes a long time to show impact. Do you have just a rule of thumb of just give them this much time to see if they can make an impact?

Luc Levesque (00:58:29):
I'd say a few things. I'd say if you already have content and pages that are pretty good and getting a decent amount of traffic, it doesn't necessarily have to take a long time. So that would be my first reaction. It can take a long time. Generally, it takes a long time when you have to build new content. So the way to think about Google is it is going to take your content, it's going to show it to its users, people that are searching, and it's going to determine which piece of content is the best to ranked highly. It's not just about little tricks and links and keyword ratios. Those days are over. Those do matter, but it's not purely about that. And if you have a new piece of content, it takes time for Google to build enough trust to say, "Okay, I'm going to start showing this to users now" and then start collecting user feedback and then rank it appropriately. That can take some time.

Luc Levesque (00:59:14):
But if you have existing pages that are ranking eight and they're already on the first page, it doesn't always happen. But I've certainly seen it, in fact more common than not that you could have sometimes hundreds of percentages of lift very quickly. And it depends what you're starting with, is probably the right way to think about it. So if I'm trying to summarize it, I would say 12 months is probably max. If you can't see impact in 12 months, there's something wrong. If you have existing content, it could happen pretty early. It could happen on day one. Actually I've seen that happen. If you have to build new parts of the site, it can take months. I've seen that happen in companies I've worked with where I think it would be like a quarter, we had to wait till we saw a big lift. So it's somewhere between three to 12 months.

Lenny (01:00:05):
Awesome. That's really helpful. Okay, so final topic/final question. You've had a truly incredible career. You've worked with incredible companies, incredible leaders. I'm looking at your site here in a site window and you're like, here's a picture of you and Zuck. Here's a picture of you and Toby from Shopify, and there's more. I'm curious what you believe has been key to your success and your career success that you suggest listeners who want to have some measure of similar success do.

Luc Levesque (01:00:36):
It's probably a bunch of things we could talk about here. Yeah, this is the obvious thing is I think you've just got to love what you do. You got to work hard. You have to have impact. Certainly at the end of the day in growth, that's all that will matter. If I think back to specific things that I do though to pick one thing that's been very important for me throughout my journey is the art of self-reflection. And coaches. I've had coaches my whole career. But the macro theme is you're constantly iterating, experimenting, and becoming the best you can be in your career also as a dad and as a husband, and of course for your own personal health. But that reflection is so important. I've leveraged many, many different coaches over the years and now do a lot of self-reflection through a morning routine that I have and that I've been doing for quite some time that has been a big unlock for me.

Luc Levesque (01:01:32):
The biggest, most important part of that morning routine is dedicating an hour aside to really think about, "What's going well? What's not going well? What am I screwing up? Well, why am I screwing it up?" Which is often more important than, "What am I screwing up?" And of course, "What am I going to do about it?" But as long as you're learning and iterating every day, then you're just making constant progress towards your goals. It's something I do that I love doing. I love thinking. So I literally can just sit there and think for hours actually. I have a dashboard on all the areas that I'm focusing on with red, yellow, green, and just constantly revving on what am I working on improving, what am I doing, what experiments am I running and where am I doing well and where am I not doing well and how can I be better in all areas of my life, including being a leader. There's a lot of different things to it, but I think that's really important and something that I've learned over the years that is probably the most valuable to have as a skill.

Lenny (01:02:32):
I definitely want to spend more time on this. So you said you sit for an hour reflecting on what's going well, what's not going well. Is there more you can share about how you accomplish that, how you find time to do this for an hour?

Luc Levesque (01:02:43):
Yeah, it sounds crazy when you say it, but I do. So I wake up at 5:00. I work out. So I do cardio, I do some exercise. There's this great book called Spark, which is all around the neuroscience of exercise and I really learned a lot from that in terms of having this great morning routine that really boots you up. I kind of call it my bootloader. When I start in the day, if I go through my bootloader, I have just a much better day.

Luc Levesque (01:03:09):
So exercise, stretching, meditation, and then I do a cold plunge now. So I do a bunch of different things. But then I do some reading, but I do carve aside one hour where I go through... And this is probably important and it's where I've landed, but structured self reflections. That's why I have this dashboard. I have certain areas that I think about what's going well, what's not. I track all the experiments I'm writing. I'm just really passionate about if you're going to do something, try to do it as best as you can. This is a habit that has allowed me to sharpen my skills in certain areas.

Lenny (01:03:47):
What are some of these things you're working on? If you can share what's on this dashboard, how can people imagine what this might be?

Luc Levesque (01:03:53):
So there's a lot of personal stuff on it, but it literally is broken down between being a better friend, better husband, better dad, and then better leader. And so on the personal side, I've been known to work a lot of times. Balance is always hard to find. From being a dad and then thinking about how to be better there, I realized about six months ago that I've never actually asked for feedback on how I'm doing. So I asked my kids six months ago, I asked both of them independently, "What's one thing I can do to do more of or do less of to be a better dad?" And they were kind of caught off guard by it. My son's 15 and my other son is 12. And I said, "Take some time to think about it." And after about a month, my son came back and said, "Dad, I got one." He said, "I want to spend more time with you."

Luc Levesque (01:04:53):
So that was very helpful for me to hear. I'm big on routines and habits to make sure that things that you want to do are repeatable and it's not one-off things. So ever since that day, I've now have a daddy date if you want to call it. But every two weeks we do one-on-one time together with each of the boys. They get to pick what we do just so we have that consistent, whether it's dinner or play basketball in the front. But it's all about feedback. So that's one example on the personal side.

Lenny (01:05:27):
This reminds me of a tweet I just saw where someone said that the only people that are going to remember that you worked late for many nights is your kids.

Luc Levesque (01:05:37):
Wow. Wow. That's deep. I like that a lot.

Lenny (01:05:43):
As a soon to be parent, that's going to stick with me.

Luc Levesque (01:05:46):
Wow, I like that a lot. So it's tough, right? It's tough to balance it all out. It's very difficult because you want excel at everything you do in life. So that reflection helps, be it check-in as well of how am I doing in all these areas? And that I find the color coding is helpful for that too, of just doing a bit of a gut check and asking for that feedback.

Lenny (01:06:06):
So it also makes me think about, I was watching a Jeff Bezos interview and ask him what his morning routine was and he said that he just likes to putter around. he likes to just sit around, talk to his kids, read the newspaper. He doesn't book any meetings in the morning. He just finds he just needs a little flex time at the beginning.

Luc Levesque (01:06:22):
Totally. Before I became a dad, I read somewhere that one of the most impactful things you can do as a father is just be there for dinner every night. So I have been there for 15 years every single night. But it was a good reminder it's not enough. Having dinner is important with your family, but in our case there's more you can do. And just getting that feedback and doing some reprioritization is always important.

Lenny (01:06:46):
Speaking of dinners, and maybe just as a last question, I know you do this really interesting thing where you have dinners with interesting people. You just kind of invite them to your house. I don't know if interesting is the right way to describe it, but just kind of interesting people, prominent people. Can you just talk about what that is and what you think about and the benefits of doing something like that?

Luc Levesque (01:07:04):
I think interesting is the right way to think about it.

Lenny (01:07:05):
Okay.

Luc Levesque (01:07:07):
I started this when I was in Ottawa with a bunch of founders there. It's become one of my favorite things to do. Honestly, it's like the bright spot in my month that, I call them guilds. So the word guild is with the builders. That's how it originally started. So Guild Night is what I call it. The idea is basically all interesting people doing interesting things actually want to spend time with each other. That's why I'm actually surprised more people don't do this. But I'll basically have interesting people come, usually five or six. We'll sit around talking about specific topics. So I do one for consumer product, I do one for SEO, I do one for growth leaders and just have really smart, interesting people come and we'll talk about different topics that are relevant.

Luc Levesque (01:07:57):
Sometimes we'll pick a topic, so we'll have a group and then we'll say, "Hey, we want to talk about AI." So one of the advantages of being in the Bay Area is you can find three or four people that likely wrote some of the core code in Google or in AI, and then they'll join. People want to meet. People want to get together and have these conversations. So it's very exhilarating. I learn a ton. It's a lot of fun. I don't know why more people don't do it. And it's a bit of work to organize, but it's also just tactically been a great way to meet fascinating people. It's helped a lot for recruiting, for if you need a back channel. Now you know all these people that are in different industries. But business aside, they're very valuable business wise, but they're just a lot of fun and they've become some of my favorite things that I do.

Luc Levesque (01:08:43):
I'm really surprised why more people don't do it because I think especially now that everybody's remote and we're working from home, or most people are, it's more valued than ever. So it's something I'm looking forward to continuing and always actually through my morning reflection, thinking about what are new ones I can spin up who are interesting people that we want to break bread with. I do think it's important that it's done at your house. If anybody's thinking of starting this, you can do it at a restaurant, but there's something about being in your home or being in somebody's home, five or six people having a great conversation about a topic that's mutually interesting. I think everybody values it and it adds a lot of spice to life. I think it's really important.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Any other tactical tips for making one of these happen? So you do it at your home, you cater. How many people? How long? Anything else you want to share there?

Luc Levesque (01:09:31):
Yeah, so I think the most I've done is 10. That's a bit too much. Six seems to be perfect, six to eight, eight at the max. I do get a catered so you don't have to worry about cooking. The topic, something like a topic that it's common so that everybody can rally around. I do think it's important, like I mentioned, doing it at home. Usually we start around 6:00, we go till 9:00 or 10. It's just been a really good thing that I've learned over time is a really good thing to do to just make for a better life, frankly. Make richer life with some great friends.

Lenny (01:10:08):
And when we say cater, it's just ordering in basically, right? It's not that-

Luc Levesque (01:10:11):
Yeah, you can just DoorDash some food so you don't have to worry about cooking. I'm sure there's other things. I've never really deeply thought about it, but in terms of what are the specific things, I've evolved it over time, but I don't cook anyways, so it would be terrible if I cooked. So this is much easier to do it this way. And as long as you're inviting kind of interesting people, everybody's going to want to come and spend some time and bring some bread.

Lenny (01:10:33):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Luc Levesque (01:10:39):
I think so.

Lenny (01:10:40):
I think you are. Well, question one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Luc Levesque (01:10:47):
So there's one that I've already mentioned, which is Spark. It's the neuroscience of exercise. That's a great book. It's not one of these exercise to stay fit and to live longer. This is really about, frankly, if you exercise and do it in a specific way, they have a kind of blueprint they lay out, it's good for just cognition and kind of horsepower and performance. So that's been a really important one and has been a big part of me building on my morning routine. The second one is when I picked up I think about a year ago or six months, and I recommended it, gee, I don't know, at least to a couple hundred people now because I recommended it to my team. It's called Smart Brevity. Have you heard of this one?

Lenny (01:11:31):
No, but I love the sound of it.

Luc Levesque (01:11:33):
I've always been big on writing crisply and being very tight and not having three-page memos that you're sending off. Especially now that we're remote and we're all doing slack and email and different ways of messaging, how tightly you communicate, how crisp your communication is really important for frankly you getting your point across and also for the other person who's probably digesting a hundred of these messages. So this book is... It's a book on how to do that. It breaks down how to write crisply and the different parts of it. I've definitely seen improvements in the team since I've passed around. So that's a great book frankly for anybody, work or personal because we're writing so much and communication is so key. So that's the second one. The third one is a golden oldie. It's one that I've read many, many times and I recommend from a growth perspective. This one youlikely heard of, it's Influence by Cialdini.

Lenny (01:12:28):
I got it back on my bookshelf there.

Luc Levesque (01:12:30):
Yeah, it's a great book, and it's because it's really the underpinning of so many different product and growth principles that you can apply. So that's just a classic that is good to reread at least once a year. So those are three books.

Lenny (01:12:42):
I'm going to extend this a little bit. I'm going to add two books that are building on your two books, or the first two books, I guess. One is Peter Attia just wrote a book called Outlive. That is-

Luc Levesque (01:12:50):
I've got to read it.

Lenny (01:12:51):
Okay. And it's exactly the same kind of premise of just how important exercise is. I think there's a quote in there of just the only thing proven to help you live longer is exercise. And then Smart Brevity, there's another book that I'd recommend if people want more on though on this topic called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.

Luc Levesque (01:13:07):
[inaudible 01:13:08].

Lenny (01:13:08):
And it's by the guy that wrote the War of Art and Bagger Vance. I forget his name off the top of my head, but it's like, "Nobody wants to read your shit. Here's what you need to do for people to want to read anything you're writing."

Luc Levesque (01:13:23):
Yeah. We want to scan. We want to read. Yeah, that's great. I'll pick that one up. Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.

Lenny (01:13:27):
Exactly. What a title.

Luc Levesque (01:13:29):
That's a great title.

Lenny (01:13:31):
All right, back on track. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Luc Levesque (01:13:36):
I don't watch TV much and I haven't really watched any movies in a while. But I do watch a lot of podcasts on YouTube. Andrew Huberman has got, of course, a great series. I've watched I think everyone he puts out, so I don't know if that counts, but that's-

Lenny (01:13:49):
Absolutely

Luc Levesque (01:13:50):
Okay. So I watched that. And then of course the All-In Podcast is always fun, so I make sure to watch those when they come out as well. A lot of fun and informative. So those are my two, I would say.

Lenny (01:14:01):
Great picks. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Luc Levesque (01:14:06):
Teach me something about growth that I don't already know. Because... and you could apply this to engineering product, any other area, because it really gives you a sense of what this person thinks is the top of the stack in terms of the smartest thing they know. Whether you know it or not is irrelevant. But sometimes you actually do end up learning some stuff. But it's my favorite question because you can really engage in a conversation around, "Okay, the thing you think is so unique that maybe you've come up with this learning yourself or you've created this tactic and then it gives you a sense of how much they know the craft." So that's my favorite question.

Lenny (01:14:42):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you just really love?

Luc Levesque (01:14:46):
I've got a cold plunge that I bought that I love. So it's called the Renew Cold Plunge. It's cold but super convenient and I do that every morning and I just love it.

Lenny (01:14:58):
Any advice for cold plunging? That sounds very painful and hard.

Luc Levesque (01:15:01):
I usually start going... I go in a hot tub to warm up, then I go in the cold plunges and back in the hot tub. That's an easy way to get started. But I will say I jumped in yesterday and today without going to hot tub. It was very painful, but I felt so much better after. So I might be changing up my approach, but I'm just kind of experimenting with different things. But that would be some advice. And then just go slow. Start it not too cold, and then slowly make it cold over time. But I think it's a pretty good thing to add in so far.

Lenny (01:15:31):
How long have you spent in the cold plunge?

Luc Levesque (01:15:33):
It varies. Right now I'm doing five minutes. Five minutes at, I think it's 53 degrees. So I've started at 60, slowly bringing it down. But you do have to go slow because I brought it down even further and kind of caught me off guard and got a little dizzy. So you got to find your sweet spot.

Lenny (01:15:53):
Damn. Very Huberman inspired. I imagine this-

Luc Levesque (01:15:57):
Definitely it was part of the source there.

Lenny (01:15:59):
I know people would hear a lot about cold plunges. I guess what have you seen as a benefit just while we're on this topic for people to seriously consider doing this?

Luc Levesque (01:16:06):
So a couple things. Mood afterwards is so much better. You get this great multi-hour boost from doing it. Especially like I mentioned, not doing warm before or waiting 10 minutes and waiting 10 minutes after before you warm up, after you get out, great mood boost. It also helps a lot with sleep. So if you do it at night, which is a little bit difficult, it helps a lot with sleep. Those are probably the two biggest things. And you do get to a point, I'm there now where I kind of look forward to it because you know how good you'll feel afterwards. So when I'm thinking about it, I know it's painful, it doesn't make it easier, but I do look forward to it now. It's a pretty cool thing.

Lenny (01:16:44):
Oh man. I got to get one now.

Luc Levesque (01:16:46):
Yeah. [inaudible 01:16:49].

Lenny (01:16:49):
Okay, two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?

Luc Levesque (01:16:56):
One change that comes to mind is it's common to hear discussion around you need to experiment, you need to have rigor, you need to look at results, iterate based on those results. That's pretty much common knowledge is how all good companies that execute growth that do it. I think the subtlety is that experiments are great, but they can be slow. You have to look at the results. You have to analyze how things went. You have to learn what's going on. You have to build the experiment. So there's a cost to an experiment and not everything needs to be experimented. And that's not something that I generally hear growth teams talk about. It's usually, "Hey, we need to experiment."

Luc Levesque (01:17:40):
So one thing that we're definitely focused more on lately is this idea of sometimes you just need to YOLO it because it's a better product experience or you just kind of know it's going to work. And if you're YOLO-ing 40 things and three of them work and you can look at pre-post, you can look at holdouts, there's ways of making sure you don't cause major damage, but the speed can outweigh the cost and time it takes to do experiment. So that's one change we've recently implemented. That's been pretty impactful.

Lenny (01:18:09):
Final question. So we met actually a long time ago in Montreal, or maybe it was in Ottawa, in Canada somewhere. I think it was through an organization called C100 when I was starting my company back in the day. And so my question is, what is your favorite Canadian food?

Luc Levesque (01:18:24):
It's funny. My favorite Canadian food, I'm from Ottawa and there's a lot of shawarma, Lebanese shawarma everywhere. I know it's not traditionally Canadian, but Canada's so multicultural, so I'll make this count. I love a good shawarma and it's so hard to find a good shawarma in the Bay Area. We've still been looking here. But my favorite Canadian food or pseudo Canadian is shawarma. If I had to pick one purely Canadian food, and this is related to Montreal where we first met, it's got to be a Montreal smoked meat sandwich.

Lenny (01:18:58):
Excellent choices. You're making me very hungry. I'm going to go get some shawarma, buy me a cold plunge. Luc, this was amazing. We talked through everything I was hoping to talk through. Advisorships, SEO, hiring, building habits, cold plunges. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Luc Levesque (01:19:18):
You can find me online at luclevesque.com. So first name, last name.com. And how can they be useful to me? Listen, we're always looking to hire the best of the best. So if you want to work at an amazing company with an amazing team doing very impactful work and learn the craft of growth, please reach out. We're always looking to bring on amazing talent. So that would be the woodway.

Lenny (01:19:40):
Awesome. Luc, thank you again so much for being here.

Luc Levesque (01:19:43):

## Transcript

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:00:00):
I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:00:33):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:01:18):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Lulu Meservey. I met Lulu while she was head of comms at Substack, where she was infamous for taking big risks and bold stands, and as a result creating a lot of attention for Substack, and other companies she's represented. Lulu is definitely the most innovative and interesting comms person I've worked with.

(00:01:46):
She's currently executive vice president of corporate affairs and chief communications officer at Activision Blizzard. And she writes what I'd say is the best newsletter on PR and comms strategy, a newsletter called Flack. In our conversation we get tactical about how to make your idea spread, cultural erogenous zones, the growing importance of going direct versus relying on traditional media. The importance of taking risks in your comms and much more. Lulu is so insightful, I could have continued to explore the subject for hours. Enjoy this episode with Lulu Meservey after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about AssemblyAI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs. They recently launched Conformer-1, the largest trained speech recognition model on the market which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. All of AssemblyAI's models, which are accessed through their API are production ready.

(00:02:54):
So many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI, and AssemblyAI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases. Now is the time to check out AssemblyAI with their new Conformer-1 model available today, which makes it even easier to bring the highest accuracy transcription to your customers just like Spotify, CallRail and Writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground, that's assemblyai.com/lenny.

(00:03:28):
This episode is brought to you by Public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash, that is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high, but buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, and you can access your cash whenever you want even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield.

(00:04:10):
Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity, so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury account at public.com/lenny. Lulu welcome to the podcast.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:04:39):
Thank you Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:41):
I am really excited to chat all things comms and PR. I've never met a founder or product leader who doesn't want to get better at spreading ideas and getting their product out there, and you're very good at this. We're going to talk about some of the things you've done in the space. But just to start maybe just broadly I'm curious to hear just what have you learned about what helps an idea spread?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:05:03):
So there's a few ways to make the idea spread, the overall principle is you have to make it memorable and you have to make people want to say it of their own volition. And so what doesn't make them want to say it is doing a favor for a corporation. What does make them want to say it is they want to bring joy to somebody else, they want to make somebody laugh, they want to appear interesting, or they want to project some part of their identity. And so a few things that you can do with an idea to make it spread better, you can make it into a joke, so you can turn it into a line that people will repeat. You can use an analogy, you can take something and just say it over and over, move fast and break things, don't be evil, build something people want.

(00:05:47):
You can create a mental image that is very colorful. So I have a mental image for people that I use a lot, which is put the pill in some cheese and we can talk about it later, it's about how to craft a story that will stick. But when I say put the pill in cheese, people tend to remember that and it's more easily repeatable. And then the last thing is use a story, use an anecdote instead of using adjectives because adjectives are so subjective, they're meaningless to people. So if you give them a story that's something they can repeat over the dinner table.

Lenny (00:06:17):
Do you have any examples of the frameworks you just shared? So you talked about maybe having an analogy or putting the pill in the cheese, which I think is referring to when you feed a dog a pill. You want to hide the pill in the cheese. Is there any stories or examples that come to mind of this in action either something you've done or other companies you've seen?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:06:34):
One example not for the better is binders of women. You remember when Mitt Romney said binders of women and it just absolutely caught on like wildfire, and it's because you can picture the binder, it's a hilarious mental image. You make lots of jokes about it. It's a very specific unusual phrasing that is very repeatable, and it lends itself so much to memeing. So it's not something that they wanted to have happen, which is a word of caution, this can backfire on you as well, but that's an example. I mentioned move fast and break things, software is eating the world, it's time to build. Those are these short phrases that take normal words and put them in an unusual order, and then especially if you repeat them a few times they just become very sticky.

Lenny (00:07:19):
These things sound really smart and wise after the fact, do you have any advice on just how to... So we're talking about coming up with a cool phrase that'll spread of how to do that. I don't know what have you seen work for coming up with move fast and break things, how would a founder approach that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:07:35):
You want to make it something that a second-grader could understand. You want to minimize the cognitive burden on the recipient. So it should be something where they're not having to expend any extra energy understanding the thing, where it immediately paints a picture. Or if you were to make a joke, it has to be a joke that they immediately get, or it's a very widely understood reference. You don't want it to be this inside joke with yourself that other people might get if you explain it to them. So if you were to boil down the essence of let's say your company or your mission, get it to one sentence and then turn it into a sentence that you could explain to a second-grader, and then cleanse it of all cliches and common parlance. And if you can then turn that into an analogy or if you can make it into something that has imagery, then you're probably 80, 90% of the way there.

Lenny (00:08:36):
So you've definitely done this on Twitter. It might be fun just to share a tweet or something of yours that has done this that has spread like crazy. I noticed you delete your old tweets, which I think is really smart and I should probably do that. So I couldn't find any examples, but I remember just being like, "Holy shit, it's got a bazillion views." Is there there an example that comes to mind that you could share? Just share something you put out that just went crazy.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:09:00):
I actually have a negative example too. I think it's useful to share my mistakes or missteps in addition to what went right, because there's more mistakes and missteps than what goes right. In general, you try a bunch of things every once in a while they succeed. But I think it's useful to think about what didn't land. And so one of mine was when you might remember this because this was the Substack era, when we were taking a lot of incoming for not censoring enough, and we took a stand that we want to encourage free expression. I was actually on maternity leave, so I was a little bit out of the loop, but I wanted to jump in there and support the cause. And so I did a thread about why we're standing by this principle even when it's hard, and the thread was pretty well received, it traveled a lot.

(00:09:53):
I think it was 30 something thousand likes among people that we cared about, people who write on the internet. And then there was one tweet in the thread where I said something like, "Doing this isn't pleasant, but neither for that matter is the sea." Completely esoteric reference, it was fresh in my mind because it was from a New Yorker book review where in that context it was poetic and evocative and beautiful. And I did the thing you're not supposed to do, which is take an inside joke with yourself and release it into the world.

(00:10:33):
And that one tweet was a dud in the middle of the thread where you could see the likes drop off precipitously and people were like, "What are you talking about?" And then afterwards I looked at it with fresh eyes, "Yeah, this makes no sense whatsoever out of a context." And also I'm not a New York book reviewer, so that was a good don't. But the fact that it was such a colorful metaphor actually caught people's attention in an accidental way. I didn't mean for it too. I guess that's a don't, does that serve as an example?

Lenny (00:11:08):
Yeah, that'll work and we'll go through other examples. But that's a good segue to something I was going to save for later, but it may be a good time to chat about is just something that you're big on is this concept of taking risks as a comms person, I think you have the sense that comms people are just very conservative, and there's a big opportunity to get a little out there. And in this case maybe it didn't work out, other times you have and it has. So just talk about that philosophy you have around taking risks.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:11:34):
I think if you're a startup your enemy is the status quo. And when you don't take risks, when you minimize risk by doing nothing, the best way to minimize risk is to do nothing. You're letting the status quo win. You're letting your greatest enemy and rival and threat to your business win by default, because you're not even going to try to compete. And so I always encourage people to try to make mistakes of commission rather than omission. Because if you make a mistake of commission you can observe it, you can learn from it. You know right away that it's happened. You can move really quickly and adapt and become better.

(00:12:11):
Whereas if you make mistakes of omission you're letting status quo win, you're not observing, you're not learning, and you're maybe not even noticing opportunities slip by. So the example that I use, again, an analogy to make it more memorable, my analogy for this is if you are investing money in the market versus if you're just sitting in cash. If you're sitting in cash you won't lose your money and it feels safe. But over time the world moves and the market grows, and everybody else is getting richer and you're getting poorer in real terms. Whereas if you make an investment it'll go up and down, there'll be some volatility. It's not just going to go up every day, but over the long run you'll be much, much better off.

Lenny (00:12:54):
Is there an example of something you did that you took a risk and it worked out, or you saw someone else do this really well?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:13:00):
The stand for free speech thread would be a risk that worked out. It was a risk because it was a topic that a lot of people were already mad about, which will happen with every topic that matters. It felt a little risky for me because I was on leave, I wasn't really in the middle of things. I was addled already, so I had at least one thing in there that was nonsensical. So there was the execution risk of would I'd be able to do this well.

(00:13:29):
There was also the risk of you poke your head up and make a thing where there wasn't a thing, and if that were to go wrong and embarrass the company or if that had made Chris or Hamish or Jerraj upset, that would've been upsetting to me and obviously a failure of my job. So that was a risk that I took and we took and they were supportive, and it did work out because the people who were most likely to write on Substack generally appreciate that stance.

(00:14:00):
I actually have one more for you Lenny when you asked about what are things that help stick in people's memory, there was the fail example of the sea analogy. I think a useful example that works is I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones, and it is something that you immediately know what I'm talking about. If I say know your audience's cultural erogenous zones, you know what it means, it's a shorthand that everybody understands. It's not an inside joke with myself, and it's something that is unusual and upraising that you're going to repeat it and hopefully remember it, so there's one for you.

Lenny (00:14:40):
You told me about that framework and I definitely wanted to hear more about it. What does that mean and is there something that you've seen someone do that's just like, "Wow, they really nailed this erogenous zone approach."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:14:54):
Yeah, they really got it in the erogenous bull bullseye. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:15:26):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:16:09):
This makes me think about one of the other tweets that I think went crazy, which is where you share the things you're muting on Twitter. Where it's like the threads thimble and the pointing down thing, and it feels like that's exactly that where people are just like, "Yep, this is me."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:16:25):
Yeah, it is that. I have an example for you Lenny. The one that my mind goes to is when Kamala Harris was running for Senate. Put aside what anyone thinks of Kamala Harris as a politician or if you agree with her politics, it doesn't matter. When she was running for Senate, she had this example where not enough people care about K-12 education. It's not a sexy topic and only moms care about it, whereas people cared a lot and still do about national defense, national security.

(00:16:55):
And so she said the way to get their attention is you go to people who care about national security and you tell them, "Did you know that in order to enlist for the army you have to have a 10th grade reading level?" If you can't read at that level, you're not going to be able to read the army field manual. And so if you care about the future of national defense and being able to maintain a standing army, you need to care about middle grade reading standards. So that's a perfect example, and in fact it stuck with me such that many years later I'm still repeating it to you.

Lenny (00:17:28):
Something else that I think what you teach helps with is underdogs coming up against incumbent companies, giving them a chance to stand out. Like Substack I think is a good example where you just helped elevate Substack on the world stage in a lot of ways. What have you found works best for underdog startups and companies trying to get attention?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:17:49):
First, you have to acknowledge that you're the underdog, and you're not going to use the GE playbook from the 1980s or whatever. So acknowledging that means knowing that you're not going to play the game that requires you to have more resources, more and deeper relationships, and institutional backings, and to be able to draft off of the current narrative. So all of those things are going to be not in your favor. If you're a startup for example, by definition you're trying to disrupt something, you're trying to do something differently, you're fighting the status quo. And if that's the case then you can't rely on maybe the government, maybe mainstream media to support what you're doing. And so you should assume that you want to go with an approach that doesn't require a lot of money or people, that doesn't require that institutional backing and those relationships.

(00:18:40):
That means building your own distribution, which you can do starting from day one. You can start doing that before you even have the company. It means taking your story and winning hearts and minds. Number one, by making it a story that you shape to fit people's cultural erogenous zones of your audience. And number two, by finding the centers of gravity in society, like the influencers that are going to help spread it for you. Because you're not going to on day one call up the New York Times and get them to print the story that you want them to. So you need to figure out who are the influencers and the way to do that, I'll cut off the rabbit hole after this because you can just go deeper and deeper, but the way to do that is in concentric circles. There's a general who said if there's a problem I look for it in concentric circles going back to my own desk.

(00:19:33):
If you want to spread something you go out in concentric circles starting from your own desk. So you need to get first really clear with yourself about what your message is and just get really crisp with it. This is hard to do because you know too much, so out of the 1,000 facts in your head you're going to have to pick just between one and three. And then the next circle is going to be your co-founders, your executives, your employees, your investors, you go to your power users, and you go out from there, and it has to be in that sequence.

(00:20:06):
But once you get the sequence and you identify who the people are and you know who your audience is, and then you're able to hone in on what their cultural erogenous zones are, then you're able to craft the message, have the delivery mechanisms, and then know your target, and then you're off. But you just need to do that exercise upfront, so you don't have a lot of wasted motion.

Lenny (00:20:25):
I really like this concentric circle framework. I haven't heard this before. Just to make it a little more real is there something that you can share, something that comes to mind that illustrates that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:20:36):
Well, you and I have talked a lot about Substack, so I'm speaking out of term now that I don't have the employee badge. But something that I thought the Substack founders have always done so well is propagate product updates out in concentric circles. So there's a lot of things where you're going to know about it. You, Lenny will know about it more than a new writer who just joined, because you're a power user of the product and they would want you... Now they would want to make sure that you love the thing, and that you feel maybe even a little bit invested in the thing. You've been telling people about recommendations for nearly a year. No one asked you to do that. We didn't pay you to do that. You've done it because you were brought on board early and it was something that the company made sure that you liked, and then you became the next circle out that spread it to your next circle out.

Lenny (00:21:33):
It's interesting because I didn't think of it as an intentional strategy to get news out, and it feels like there's a synergy with just talking to your power users. Getting feedback from your power users leads to this interesting second order effect where they also want to... they feel like they're on the inside of something, they want to share it and maybe talk about it and tell friends about, "Hey, Substack's working this cool thing." So that's kind of a cool-

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:21:53):
Well, early on Lenny you asked about how do you get a message to spread? And I said you give people incentives who want to spread it. So your incentive was you helping others, you like paying it forward and helping other writers and podcasters, and you genuinely enjoy the thing. And I think there's some value to your own project that you get to show social proof that a lot of people like this thing and it's growing, and that's what you got. If it had been like, "Hey, Lenny, can you do us a favor and tweet this thing?" You might've done it, but you would've done it once and stopped and it wouldn't have been something that you organically keep doing.

Lenny (00:22:30):
To make this even more real I'm trying to help people understand this concentric circle idea, so first Substack is an example. What would be the few layers of the concentric circle on the middle would be maybe the power writers. What would be the next couple layers?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:22:46):
It's the employees at the middle, almost always, and then it is depending on the company. So here it would be the power writers, it's youth, a lot of the original writers. Bill Bishop comes up a lot, he was Substacker number one, he's always really meaningful. And then it's fast growing writers. It is writer influencers. There are certain members of the media that cover media and writing, and so they matter a lot. And then investors are in there just to keep close to the fold.

(00:23:18):
But if you're a different kind of company that might be employees board, institutional investors, government and regulators then users, just depending on how much power each group has to influence your future. And the reason I say go out in concentric circles as opposed to just hit each of these groups kind of haphazardly is that's your way to control the message. Because each circle is going to assume that the inner circle knows better than them and they're going to follow the lead of the inner circle. So an example is if you and I have a company, Lenny and Lulu, this is a DTC startup.

Lenny (00:24:01):
That's a great name.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:02):
It is, we should do it.

Lenny (00:24:03):
We should do this.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:04):
If we had a company and we were trying to put out a message to the world that our new thing works, it's really revolutionary, our genes are the best genes. If employees are not saying that, then people are going to look at employees and say, "Well, they would know, they're closer to this than we are. So if they're not excited then why would we be excited?" And so that undermines everything that we're trying to do, you can't skip a circle is my point.

Lenny (00:24:32):
Super interesting. And I imagine the closer they are to the employees the more time you spend with them, and the more innately they're closer and also their perspective and what they share is more powerful because they're closer to what's happening.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:48):
And if it goes wrong the more damage they can do. So on the spectrum it's if they are not totally on board and they're not an effective messenger, versus they're just lukewarm and they're not really sure they believe it. All the way to they actively fell off the bandwagon and you lost them, and now they're out there proactively contradicting everything you say or even trying to destroy the company, that can happen. If an early employee, for example, feels disgruntled, which is easy to do and it's easy to do through a comms mistake. If you sell them on one thing and here's a vision, and now either that's changed or you miscommunicated. If they feel like there's a bait and switch they're going to be really mad. And now you've created someone who is incredibly credible and has the same social and professional circle as you and is trying to ruin you.

Lenny (00:25:44):
That's such a good point. For someone that's trying to do this maybe internally they're like, "Oh, cool, we got to create these circles for our startup." What do you recommend they do? Do they make a list of here's our inner circle, here's the next circle of people.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:25:56):
Yeah, you take out your one-page Google Doc. I feel like most comms problems can be solved with one-page Google Doc. So you go to your one-page Google Doc and you take your audiences, you list them, probably stop at five or six because past that it's like way, way first world problem. You'll have more than enough work to win over the five or six inner circles, and then you have to rank them. And you rank them by how much they're able to influence your success and how much credibility other groups assign them. So then you have your inner to outer circles.

(00:26:32):
And then for each of them you would think about what do they care about that's their cultural erogenous zones and where do they reside intellectually? So do they listen to podcasts, if so, which ones. Do they go to in-person conferences? Are they getting all of their news from Reddit? If so, which subreddits are they on Hacker News? Once you map that out, then again you have the people you're trying to reach, the ideas and messages that resonate the most with them, and then the ways to actually reach them.

Lenny (00:27:04):
This is becoming a real template we can start using. In the bucket of erogenous zones what are some examples of erogenous zones for people in this context?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:27:15):
We've talked about the free expression stand from last year. A lot of people care about first amendment, protecting press freedoms and free expression. Not a lot of people care that a journalist said something mean about Substack. And so there were a few times when we did have to push back publicly against a journalist saying something mean and unfair or untrue about Substack. So obviously my and our ulterior motive is to vindicate the company and show people that this isn't true. But if we had just done that, nobody would've cared or maybe a few diehards would've cared. There are people who care deeply about Substack, but not as many people and not as deeply as the people who care about their ability to express themselves freely or their right to build their own media platform without too many controls.

Lenny (00:28:20):
The way you described it earlier came back to me as you were talking, which is this idea that lights people up. What lights people up within this list of people that you're making? So that's really interesting. So the idea is create this list of people across circles further and further away from your employees. Think about what lights them up, what are their erogenous zones intellectually, and then think about where they spend their time intellectually, what are they listening to? What are they reading?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:44):
Yeah, that's it.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Amazing, this is super cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:47):
It's not easy, it's hard, you have to make very difficult tactical decisions every day when you're doing that, but it is simple.

Lenny (00:28:54):
Yeah, it seems pretty easy. Okay, this is great. Another framework that we haven't talked about yet, do you have this math formula for how ideas spread? Does that ring a bell?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:05):
Okay, let's get into that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:06):
I think it's useful to try to bring as much discipline as possible to comms, because you're really just measuring vibes. In a world of OKRs and data and metrics it's hard to know if you're doing the right thing with comms. And so I think whenever you're able to establish a framework its useful, so this one is kind of a mathematical formula of comms for a purpose. It assumes that you have a business goal and as a business goal, not communications goal, it's not get this many impressions or go viral or blah. It is we're going to grow our revenue by X, or we're going to make this penetration into this user base. When you have your business goal you're going to need certain people to do certain things for that goal to come true. So for example, you're going to need this type of person in this quantity to buy these sneakers in order for you to meet your revenue goal.

(00:30:07):
So now you know who the people are and the action they need to take. The next step is what do they need to believe in order to take that action? So they need to believe that their feet are not comfortable now, and that it's possible for their feet to be more comfortable and that'll have a positive effect on their life, and that this new sneaker technology is real, so they need to believe these things. Then it's where do they reside intellectually? How do you deliver that message to them, and that's the who do they listen to? Which accounts do they follow? Which podcast do they... what trips do they take? What newspapers, et cetera. And when you have that then you have the equation of we need to deliver this message to these people through these mediums in order to get them to do this thing with this call to action. And that way you know that you're at least pushing forward and getting something done with your comms as opposed to just saying words into the ether.

Lenny (00:31:11):
I think you had something like there's pressure and force and area, is that part of this or is that a different framework?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:17):
Different framework.

Lenny (00:31:18):
Oh, okay, cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:20):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:31:21):
Okay, okay, let's talk about this other framework too.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:24):
I've got more frameworks, Lenny.

Lenny (00:31:25):
I love it, this is what this podcast is all about. Let's do it.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:29):
This is a useful one for early stage startups especially, or anybody who's just trying to be lean and efficient, which is anyone who's an underdog like we talked about earlier, that if you decrease the surface area than with the same amount of force you can apply more pressure. So the amount of pressure is the force divided by the surface area, this is a basic equation for physics, but it's also true of communications, which is if you decrease the surface area and don't try to appeal to everybody with everything. And you're targeting exactly whom you're talking to and you are sharpening your message to a point, to get them in the bullseye of the cultural erogenous zone. Then you're able to with the same amount of effort or expense or time, you're able to make more of an impact, you're able to apply more pressure.

(00:32:30):
So I think of it as there's a continuum between you can either hyper-target, so the extreme of the continuum is you are becoming the life partner of one person. That's the ultra hyper targeting. And then the other end of the spectrum is you're appealing to everybody. You're appealing to a larger number of people, but with a weaker message, in a weaker way. So you could say world peace is good, nobody disagrees with that practically, but also it doesn't stick and it's not meaningful to them. So you have to choose where you're going to be along that continuum. And for most startups I would choose towards the fewer people end of it, where you choose who's going to be your diehards and then you foster them and create really deep meaningful relationships with them. And the way to do that is to decrease the surface area and apply more pressure.

Lenny (00:33:23):
It feels like you did that with Substack where it was focused on people writing online, or I guess tell me is that how you thought about it Substack of here's our little focused area and we'll focus target message to that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:33:37):
That was the goal and that's actually why I started spending time on Twitter. It was a very self-loathing exercise like Hamish doesn't like the Twitter model, nor do, we would talk about this a lot and I always felt a little bit fringe being on there. And before I worked at Substack I had a sleepy account of a couple hundred followers that didn't do very much. And I realized that the people that we were trying to speak to are heavy Twitter users, whether it's media people or online writers. And so I decided I'm going to spend some time and try to build an audience and then that audience became leverage, for better or worse. I don't think we should measure people by their Twitter following, but the fact is that if you have more then journalists and writers take you a bit more seriously. And so if I was going to try to carry a message on behalf of the company, I felt like it would be more effective if I had more people.

Lenny (00:34:38):
And it worked. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

(00:35:18):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups, it's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:35:56):
Going back to this formula, pressure equals force divided by area. Basically, to increase the effectiveness of your message you can either increase the force and what is in this context force? Is it like the amount of messaging or is it the success of your message?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:36:11):
It's the amount of effort you put into it. So it's how much you are spending on this campaign or you have a limited amount of hours in the day and dollars in the bank. And so anytime you're doing something with comms, you're either paying the dollars or you're paying the time. Sometimes you're drawing down on credibility too, you have a certain amount of credibility and there are times when you just have to say, "Please trust me." You can spend that more efficiently if you focus. So instead of if you just take a simple ad campaign, instead of spending a million dollars to reach a million people, maybe you spend a $100 to reach the hundred most important people. And focus that message exactly to them so that when they see your ad they're actually going to click on it and they're actually going to forward it, and that's a much better return. And then you might end up with a million dollars worth of return, because those people were so passionate that they then became their own messengers without you even having to be involved anymore.

Lenny (00:37:12):
This is a really great framework, again, is your advice that for the smaller you are just basically reduce the area?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:21):
Yes.

Lenny (00:37:22):
And the larger you are increase that over time?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:24):
Yes. If you're just starting out, get 10 diehards and just spend all your time... You can't start out and try to win over the general public. You start out by creating a tiny, not the best analogy is one I can think of right now, a tiny monopoly. And it's the same like succeeding on Substack or creating anything on the internet. You choose what is going to be your tiny corner of the internet that you are going to just dominate entirely. And the smaller it is, the more you can dominate it and then these people that are in it become your true believers, your diehards, and they'll expand it out to the next circle and then you go from there. But if you try to win over everybody at the same time, it's a food coloring in the ocean kind of thing as opposed to food coloring in a cup.

Lenny (00:38:17):
Is there an example that comes to mind of someone that did this really well? I don't know. I know it's hard to think of just an example off the top of your head, but does anything come to mind?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:38:25):
Balaji did this really well with his book The Network State, that book was super successful. He didn't do a lot of the traditional book tour New York Times stuff. He went his own route, and I think that was really smart if you're going to put it in the setting of this framework, it's he created his own distribution channels. He didn't try to compete with the roster of Harper Collins on their turf, and when he created his own distribution channels he focuses on who are the diehards and the truth fans, and these are people that he fosters. He goes on podcasts that reach these people. He doesn't deviate from messaging to try to appeal to everybody. There are people who just will never like that guy and he is totally fine with it. So he's not watering down who he is to appeal to people who will never like him, which it's tempting for companies to do.

(00:39:17):
You hate when people are mad at you, so you try to appeal to them and then your true fans lose their passion because the thing that made you so special has now gone milk toast. So Balaji fosters his true fans and then when the book launched they propelled him to the top of the Amazon list, because they were out there evangelizing, proselytizing. You probably saw all these tweets about his book. He didn't pay anybody as far as I know. He didn't pay anybody to do that. He just shared it with the people and they wanted to show that they were into this.

Lenny (00:39:46):
That's a great example. I know that founders often worry focusing too narrowly limits their market, and it's never going to grow into anything large. In your experience do you find that that's just often not true, that there's often a much bigger opportunity than they think? Or is that just a good way to start and then you expand from there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:40:03):
It's both. If you're writing online or doing something online, the denominator is the size of the internet. You don't need to capture 80% of it. If you capture 0.01% of it, that is a great business and then you can go from there. Once you've won that then you can decide to go from there and the world is a big place. So now that everything's digital the denominator's so large that I wouldn't worry too much about the numerator. But it is also true that if you start off trying to peel to too many people, you have to water down your stuff so much that you'll never stand out. And you've written about this Lenny with how to be viral, how to be noticed, and one of the things is be remarkable. And you can't be remarkable if you're trying to appeal to so many people that you have to become the average of 500,000 people's tastes.

Lenny (00:40:57):
This is a good way to think about I think when something's not working, when you're trying to get a bunch of attention for your product and no one cares. Feels like this is one reason is just you're going too wide.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:09):
Yeah, I think that's probably the most common reason.

Lenny (00:41:14):
Maybe just thinking about diagnosing why your comms may not be working. This may be too big of a question, but just what other explanations could there be for why no one cares about what you're trying to put out?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:25):
You're doing it as a corporation instead of a person. This is another super common mistake is you're letting yourself speak like a faceless corporation because it feels like that's what you should do now. Okay, now you're a real company and now you got to do real company stuff, that means you have to issue decrees on behalf of the C corp and you don't. And it doesn't work because people don't trust institutions. People don't like corporations or at least are not passionate about them. People care about people and trust and like people, and so there's a sense of wanting to cosplay an executive and it doesn't work, it doesn't resonate. A good example of this would be Ryan Peterson at Flexport. His company, even after it got huge, he never became the generic corporate chief. He always was a person. And there are people, many, many people who became interested in Flexport because Ryan's an interesting guy. And it's not like they had a passion for logistics and freight and shipping, but he's doing something interesting. And then he became the human gateway drug for people to become interested in his company.

Lenny (00:42:40):
Yeah, absolutely. He had that crazy viral tweet about the ports and that's a really good example. Man, I was going to go in a different direction, but maybe we go to this idea of going direct. You're a big fan and Balaji is a really big fan of this too, speaking of just the importance of going direct. So maybe just talk about what does that mean and why is that important these days?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:42:58):
Well, Balaji is more go direct than me. He thinks that I'm soft in this area because I think that there's still a place for engaging with media and that it's just another tool. He's for just straight-up go direct undistilled. But I think that for everybody a 100% of the time you want going direct to be a part of what you're doing, whether it's all you're doing, or whether you're doing something else, you can't not have a direct channel. So what that actually looks like, and people say this all the time go direct. What does that actually look like to go direct? It means that the founder or executive for some very senior person has to be speaking from themselves. First person, may be first person plural, and speaking in a human voice authentically. You see them make mistakes, you see them be vulnerable, and they have to become an ambassador to the community.

(00:43:55):
If you don't have that, then you don't have a direct channel even if you have a Twitter or a Substack or whatever, it's not direct if not connected to a person because if the other side of it is a corporation there's no direct connection. And then the second thing is start building your own audience as soon as possible. You can do this alongside engaging with the media or doing traditional things. To the point of focusing your energy and decreasing the surface area, for startups I would not recommend trying to do an Instagram, a Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok. I would choose the thing that that person is the best at. So if your spokesman is going to be your CEO, which is a good default, they're going to have a dominant communication style where they're the best at being themselves. And that's important because if somebody else is ghost-writing all their stuff, it shows.

(00:44:53):
So some CEOs are better at writing long form. Some CEOs are better at doing videos. Some do better with audio or podcasts, some are better with short form. The way that Elon Musk communicates on Twitter, he's born to do Twitter. You can't picture him writing long thoughtful blog posts, it's not a thing that he does. Whereas Brian Armstrong or Hamish or Chris, they write great blog posts that are sincere and effective, and that's better than them just trying to do it only through tweets. So pick the thing that your spokesperson is the best at and then invest everything into that channel, and then build it up to a decent amount and then expand outward. Because if you try to build six or seven channels at once you're just not going to get anywhere.

Lenny (00:45:47):
I think that's such a important point. I feel like me choosing a newsletter was actually a really good choice. As much as you may not believe this I'm not a performer person, I just want to hide behind the computer and just type stuff. And the newsletters, especially during COIVD, I was like, "I just sit at home and share stuff and edit and think about it where it's like, 'Hello everyone.'" And it took me a while to get to this point of like, "Oh, I can maybe do a podcast because I've built up a little more confidence that this is useful." So I so agree with that and that's what I tell a lot of people. Just pick the platform that is most natural to you. Maybe you like talking, maybe you performing on video, maybe you just want to sit and type.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:46:24):
And that's a good point too, Lenny, because it changes over time. Just because you pick one thing doesn't mean that you're stuck with only that forever. Over time you might choose different things and I've seen founders become a lot more comfortable in front of the camera, for example, once they've done a few reps. And the other reason to know that you can just change it over time is otherwise it feels like a deterrent to getting started. Sometimes there's paralysis if I don't know which thing to choose, and so I'm either going to do a bunch of them or none of them. Go with your gut pick one and you're not wed to that forever, you can always change it down the road.

Lenny (00:46:58):
Do you think every founder needs to be on Twitter? I get this a lot from founders. Do I need to be on Twitter? I hate Twitter. What's your take?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:47:04):
No, I think a lot of founders do. If they are super mission driven, for example, that's one way that you're going to find other people that resonate with your mission and that you're going to make the case for the mission. If you're mission driven there's also a good chance that you're doing something that some people love and some people hate. And so you're going to need to be out there fighting the fight in a way. I don't mean in a pugilistic antagonistic way, but you have to defend your thing. And so I think it's important if you're mission driven. I also think it's important if your charisma is a big part of recruiting for the company. There are some companies where the founder's charisma is a big part of why people want to go work there. So Palmer Lucky and Anduril, he is magnetic to a lot of engineers and they want to go work with that guy, specifically. Whereas there are companies where people want to go work for the company and it's less important that the founder is vocal.

Lenny (00:48:02):
What's interesting I found recently is I get more traffic to my newsletter from LinkedIn than Twitter. Is that something you think about at all? Going to LinkedIn instead of Twitter feels so wrong to say, but what's your take there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:14):
Yes, if you are career related, LinkedIn will be a lot better. One, it's better because it's not such a cesspool where anything immediately becomes controversial and people fight over it in their mentions. Two, because LinkedIn is really underutilized and founders should know this, PMs should know this. LinkedIn is super underutilized because it gets a ton of eyeballs in time, but most of the content sucks. 95% of the content this is not scientific-

Lenny (00:48:49):
Seems right, seems right.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:50):
This is my might estimate. 95% of the content is people congratulating each other on work anniversaries or people saying, "I'm so proud of my team for this thing they did." And then people react out of a sense of friendship and affection or support, but actually genuinely interesting and useful content on LinkedIn is very rare. So the ratio of your competitive set of interesting content versus how much time and attention people spend on there is excellent.

Lenny (00:49:24):
That is really good advice. I'm going to throw a fishing line into the pool of examples. You talked about people doing this well, going direct. Balaji talking about Ryan Peterson and Elon obviously. Is there anyone else that's just like here check out what they're doing and could be a good model to learn from?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:49:41):
I think it's really interesting to see what Mike Solana is doing with Pirate Wires. Here's an example of why it clearly makes sense to have the founder be very active on Twitter because he is his own recruiter and spokesperson. So I think the makeup industry actually is at the forefront of this. The makeup industry is smarter than all of us in how they use social media and influencers, because they caught on very early on that people don't buy makeup to subscribe to makeup brands, that they do it because a certain celebrity or influencer or Kardashian has this nice looking eyelid and they want their eyelid to look that way.

(00:50:25):
And so going back years before the rest of us were talking about going direct, there are makeup companies that would spend $0 on marketing, and minimal efforts on press and pour all of it decreasing the surface area. Pour all of it into fostering a small roster of influencers and having them spread the message. And so I think watch makeup companies, watch consumer companies, they're doing it right, they speak with a human voice, they speak through human beings and they're fast. If there's a trend the same day they will have hopped on the trend... within an hour they're on the trend, as opposed to other industries or more traditional companies that take a few days and they route through approvals and then the opportunity's gone.

Lenny (00:51:11):
What are some makeup companies for people to check out to see what they're doing?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:51:14):
So NYX, N-Y-X, it's a division of L'Oreal. NYX is wanted the makeup companies that has, as far as I know $0 spent on marketing and all of their dollars and all of their effort spent on paying influencers. And they really out punched their weight in terms of using humans to deliver a message that contains a call to action and then selling out product. And the product will be like a normal black eyeliner. It's the most fungible thing you could possibly imagine, and that one eyeliner will be sold out at CBS's across the country for a couple weeks, because they did something right with their social media using a person.

Lenny (00:51:57):
Just a couple more questions around this going direct concept. I don't know if you actually talked about why that's important because I think we talk about this a lot, and I think people may not recognize why people find this so important these days. What's the motivation behind that with Balaji and other founders?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:52:14):
There's two reasons it's important, there's the offense and the defense of it. The defense of it is going back to having the underdog, the insurgency mentality. If you're trying to do something different that goes against the grain, people are going to attack you. Not everyone's going to like it. And the point is that not everyone should like it, but you need a way to stand up for yourself because you don't have the big institutions and power structures that are going to do that work for you because you're going against the grain. So if you're going to stand up for yourself there's only one way to do it, which is you do it. And so building the audience and the channels and you have to prime the market. By which I mean if you're a public company, you're priming the market by getting them used to how you convey information to them.

(00:52:58):
If you're a small startup or a founder, you're priming the market by making your audience aware of how you normally communicate, so that when you do something it's not weird. If you never post and then suddenly you start posting, people are going to think you're having a crisis or something like what is going on? They're going to try to read into it. So you have to already have the cadence and the relationships set up so that when you need to draw on them if you're under attack then you can, that's the defense of it. The offense of it is if you're doing something new and if you're mission driven, and if what you're doing is truly unique and innovative, no one else will be to tell that as well as you. The most friendly, sympathetic reporter on Earth could not tell that as well as you because they don't understand it as well as you, and so the onus just falls on you to do it.

Lenny (00:53:52):
If someone listening is like, "Yep, okay, I fully agree, time to do this." What do you suggest as a next step to starting to build an audience and going direct broadly.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:54:03):
Step one would be assessing what are you good at and what do you enjoy? So that's where you decide, do I like long form writing, or do I enjoy podcasting, or what are my mediums? Step two is setting up your account on those channels. So if you enjoy long form writing then you're going to have to choose, do you do a Substack, do you do Medium or whatever else? There's a objectively right answer on that one. But if you are doing short videos you're going to choose are you going to invest in Instagram, or you're going to invest in TikTok, you set that up. And then you start building your audience. And when you start if you're actually starting from zero, get some pipeline of talent ready. Sorry, not pipeline or talent, pipeline of content. Get it ready, it's the same way as if you're launching a Substack.

(00:54:54):
If you're launching a Substack you want to get a week or two of posts ready to go, so that out the gate you can build a lot of momentum. With different social networks it actually helps the algorithm if you come out the gate strong and are really regular. So TikTok, for example, if you're starting at TikTok with zero followers, you want to get a week or two of solid data just in the pipeline so you can hit it, hit it because the algorithm favors you right as you're starting out because they want you to keep going, so you want to ride that as much as possible. So that's step two is just get yourself ready for launch. Don't do one post and wait, get a bunch of posts ready and then boom, boom, boom. And then three is to have an ongoing content strategy, you know who you're going to reach, you know what they care about.

(00:55:42):
So you have to plan out, "Here's the cadence with which I'm going to talk to them. Here's how I'm going to do community management and respond to people, and here are the ways where I'm going to do announcements." And you get into a cadence because it's the same as growing a newsletter. The regularity and the consistency is a big part of growing. And so it's the same with audience. A mistake that people make I think is just every once in a while trying to go viral as opposed to just being consistent. And then some posts do better than others organically, but that's the way to do it. I don't live that. I'm not a good example because I'm so self-loathing about being on Twitter I will go away for one or two weeks and do nothing, and then I'll come in with a bunch of posts in one day. It's not a best practice. It's not the way you're supposed to do it. Ideally, you're just there every day saying something and then it builds over time.

Lenny (00:56:36):
I'm actually an example of trying to focus on consistent non-viral content and it's worked out.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:56:44):
It has worked out.

Lenny (00:56:46):
It's worked out. It's worked out so far, but it's interesting to see how different people act and how it's like I'm trying to go viral every tweet, every post and that is hard. And it's also just like people can tell you're just trying to create some viral thing and no one cares.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:57:00):
And it's very obvious when you're just trying to go viral for the sake of it and you don't have a real message. It's like the post when people screenshot the iPhone six digit security code and they say best feature apple's ever built. A few people did that, and now I've seen it probably dozens of times. And it doesn't even help to get you followers because that's not something where people say, "Only this person could uniquely give me this kind of content in the future." If you're going to get followers with a one-off joke, it has to be an incredibly hilarious one-off joke where they say, "This person is going to keep entertaining me." But with these kind of viral baits, I don't think it's even that effective.

Lenny (00:57:41):
And also what I find if something does go viral, whatever the correct term is and then life goes on, nothing's going to significantly... that's just one thing, and then you have to do it again and again. That's where people don't realize like, "Oh, I went viral. I'm done. My life is good now." Nothing's going to really change most often, and you have to do it again and again.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:58:03):
I think that's true. One thing that I've noticed about your audience, Lenny, is that it's the right audience. It's the people who find value in what you do, and they're in the right place and there's a match. Sometimes in the effort to just gain followers for the sake of it or a go viral for the sake of it, you end up with a mismatch of the audience. You had this viral hamster tweet, and now they're all here expecting hamster content, and they're not engaging with you, you're not bringing value to them. It's just making the number go up, which is not that meaningful. So one example of this is there's all these threads about how to just grow on Twitter for no reason, just grow for the sake of growing.

(00:58:48):
And it's a lot of generic advice of make sure that you bullet point out the 10 things. But it's always pablum of make sure that you value your relationships, and make time for yourself. And things that are not enriching people's lives they get a lot of likes that are low value likes from random people about the internet. But I don't think that they're deepening a relationship with a meaningful audience, and I don't think that they're really capturing the respect and admiration of their peers. So I think it's just important to consider what trade-offs people make in their efforts to grow.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:35):
Ready.

Lenny (00:59:35):
First question. Great. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:41):
I recommend Gates of Fire, it comes off the Marine Commandants Reading List, it's on there perennially. It is about the Battle of Thermopylae, it's the 300 Spartans, but it's the whole backstory. And if you get into it's about leadership, it's about courage, it's about creativity, and it's really well-written, so that's one that I recommend a lot.

Lenny (01:00:00):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:03):
I've been watching The Last Of Us, like everybody on Earth. I've been watching it both for entertainment and for work, because it's really interesting to see how the show drives sales of the video games, and how you can use that to make the whole of the sales greater than the sum of its parts. So I'm watching that really carefully.

Lenny (01:00:24):
Interesting. We have a drinking game now. Every time someone says Last of us that's a new thing because it's starting to come up a lot, so everyone enjoy your drink. Favorite interview question you like to ask?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:36):
I like to ask people what they've been reading too. It's a good way to get good book recommendations. It's also a good way to see where their head's at when they're not working.

Lenny (01:00:45):
Favorite SaaS products that you use day-to-day and bonus points for something that is new or interesting that you've recently discovered?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:52):
I don't know that this is new or novel because I use Notion for almost everything, and I really like the new AI that they've built into it. I also have been using Lex, which is Nathan Baschez startup, where it's like the AI writing editor that you've probably seen. I'm trying to think if there's anything that I use that other people don't. I don't think I'm terribly original in that sense. I use a lot of Microsoft Excel, which I think is controversial.

Lenny (01:01:21):
That is, wow, that's cool, but I get it. That's when you know you're doing serious work, you got to accelerate.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:27):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:01:28):
Final question, best tip for someone trying to get attention for their product, take away tip, best takeaway tip.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:37):
Give it away for free to the right people. If you can choose the people who are going to love it, look at the Venn diagram of people who are going to be obsessed with this product. And people who have a large following among the other people that you want to get to, whoever falls into that sliver of the Venn diagram shower them with free product.

Lenny (01:01:58):
Amazing. Lulu, I think this conversation is going to lead to a lot more people going direct, taking risks and ideas spreading. Thank you for being here. Two final questions where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:13):
People can find me at getflack.com, that's where I write down my ideas, hopefully more frequently in the future than in the past. But that's where they can find some of this stuff if they're interested. How can listeners be helpful to me is to give me feedback. I'm learning on the job. I don't think that there's anyone alive who's an expert in communicating in this crazy environment that we have now. I think we're all crossing the river by feeling the stones, and so your listeners have gone through this in many different ways. And I hope that if they have new ideas of feedback or objections, that they'll email me through that website or on Twitter and let me know what they think.

Lenny (01:02:54):
Amazing and its get flack.com.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):
Yes.

Lenny (01:02:55):
We'll link to it in the show notes.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:02:57):

# Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)

## Transcript

Maggie Crowley (00:00:00):
If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Maggie Crowley. Maggie is currently vice president of Product at Toast.

She's also got an MBA from Harvard Business School. She was also an Olympic speed skater, which is insane and incredibly cool. And in our conversation we discuss the three most common threads across the best product managers that she's worked with, hired and managed how to very tactically write out a product strategy to share with your team and manager why being data-driven is a red flag for product thinking. Why product content you find online can be dangerous. Her best advice for how to break into product management. Also, the impact writing online has had on her career and so much more. Maggie is amazing.

(00:04:06):
Maggie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Maggie Crowley (00:04:10):
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:04:12):
You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets, I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. And I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked with a bunch of PMs, you've hired a lot of PMs, you've managed a lot of PMs, and so I guess the question is just what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?

Maggie Crowley (00:04:50):
Yeah, it's an interesting question mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.

(00:05:31):
First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.

Lenny (00:06:15):
I think that's a really interesting point, because it sounds simple. Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.

Maggie Crowley (00:06:33):
Prioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. And I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.

(00:07:13):
Because I think a lot of when we talk about product, it's like, oh, what should you build? What should you ship? But then you actually have to ship that and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, a year. And so as a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again, and the best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and the energy to stay with it.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Energy. That's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So, either we can go into how you found you get better at simplifying or we go through all three and then we can come back, however you prefer.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:51):
Let's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.

Lenny (00:07:54):
Sounds great.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:55):
So, yeah, first one, simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one pager or something will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move. Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today, that gets you some extra points, but the really, really good PMs remember to follow up. Because especially when you're in management, couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature, but if a PM comes back to me and says, "Hey, remember we did that thing, here's what happened." I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that and for the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs and it's easy.

(00:08:43):
It's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's really high value activity. And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is that a phrase actually we were talking about David Cancel before we started carrying the water, and this was a big theme when I joined Drift, and this is about how you can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard boring unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing, copy, project management, you have to do that stuff. It's your job. No one else is going to do it, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So, you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.

Lenny (00:09:33):
It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally what people think about.

Maggie Crowley (00:09:50):
Those things to me, communication, super important, analytical ability, really, really important. The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work and build up intuition around that, also really important. Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role. These are the things that make you great at the role and strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit. It's one tiny slice. You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy and you need to pick the right products, but at the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps and has the ability to actually create impact. So, to me, you could be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.

Lenny (00:10:48):
And impact is the other one. Everyone's always like, what makes a great PM? Oh, drive a lot of impact. And again-

Maggie Crowley (00:10:52):
But they never say how.

Lenny (00:10:54):
Right, exactly.

Maggie Crowley (00:10:54):
It's like, cool, let's do a strategy, let's have impact. Then when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact. And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what? Yeah, impact. Let's do it. Where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.

Lenny (00:11:14):
I love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three and I'm curious just what you found helps you become better at these things and also just an example if you can share. So, say what's simplifying? How does one build that muscle?

Maggie Crowley (00:11:27):
This is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like are they a simplifier or are they complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated, it doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, check it out, can you read it?

(00:12:10):
I read it and then I put it down and I say, "What are you trying to say?" And 99% of the time they say, "Oh, users are really struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the way to solve it's to do X", but that's not what the document says. And so my reaction is always, and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to this, they're going to laugh is always, "Just say that. Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write." There's no reason why your pros in a document has to be a certain way. We're not in school. Our goal is to get things done. So, those are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I've already been working on.

(00:12:54):
And as for how to boil things down and really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many reps in as you can, have people review your work and listen to them. There's a thing that happens I think with PMs where you join a company and then all of a sudden it's like my boss doesn't know what they're doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop in and mess everything up, but those people had an insight on the market that you're in that made the company worth founding and they probably know more than you and so you might want to listen to them. And so find people who can review your work, listen to them and ask them to help you simplify.

Lenny (00:13:39):
I'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you were talking, because this is a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it again and again and honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to simplify in my writing and strategy docs one-pagers and things like that, and I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is learning just to strip down as much as you can and anything that isn't necessary. So, there's a couple things that I'll share real quick. One is there's this book I read called On Writing Well, that is one of the most impactful books for writing for me, and the whole book is like, I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should cut from your writing and they show all these examples of like, here's a before and here's an after.

(00:14:18):
And all these words were cut and nothing changed. They're completely necessary. So, I think that book can help and partly it's just like what is not necessary? You think all these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is the rule of thirds, I guess the rule of three, of just always having three. Try not to go beyond three when you're giving strategy bets or priorities or things like that. Just try to keep things under three.

Maggie Crowley (00:14:44):
Yeah, it's a very sort of business school ex-consultant point of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice round couple and if you have a fourth, you've got to figure out how to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's four.

Lenny (00:15:02):
Agree. Yeah, even though I've been guilty of more than three, try hard to avoid it.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:07):
Yeah, you're using notion and you have your three bullets expanding and there's sub bullets, but at least you have that top line.

Lenny (00:15:13):
That's right. The other thing is I think that there's just a focus you need to get good at just like, people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do that it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's just a lot of power and pick the thing, pick the thing that's going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have some impact but is much less important.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:31):
I think again, simplification is something and prioritization, which is sort of the same thing, gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at, but it's really challenging. Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things, you'll never be successful if you do that in a number of things. And so you have to pick one.

(00:15:59):
And so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then B, having the willingness, and maybe I should have added this to my what makes great PMs list, the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. And that's what I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right.

Lenny (00:16:32):
Ownership such an important part of just being a PM. Again, coming back to this interview I just did with an ex Amazon guy, that's one of their principles at Amazon is just leaders, basically ownership, feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on.

Maggie Crowley (00:16:46):
I agree, but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same oh shit feeling as you're making a bet. You make a bet, that means you know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going to work out and you still have to be the one to do the thing, jump off the ledge, drop in on the ski run. So, ownership to me never signaled that risk that I think comes with being a PM.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Good point. On the simplify concept, it reminds me at Airbnb, one of the core values at Airbnb for time was simplify. Is this idea that we should always try to be simplifying, and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it. So, they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't have aspirational values, we should reflect who we actually are, and they actually cut two different values to be more clear, even though they still want to simplify, they're just like, we're not actually good at this, so why are we pretending like we are.

Maggie Crowley (00:17:45):
I think maybe I'm good at it on paper, but there's been many times where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep fighting for it.

Lenny (00:17:54):
Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to become better as a PM and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reduce your email length? Is it one pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind

Maggie Crowley (00:18:12):
On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second.

Lenny (00:18:36):
I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people that I will link in the show notes that gives you-

Maggie Crowley (00:18:41):
Fantastic.

Lenny (00:18:42):
The Minto Pyramid principle.

Maggie Crowley (00:18:42):
Yes, everyone should do that. A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is, everyone will thank you. Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them. My dad, again, to go back to my dad when I would write, and this sounds cruel, but I promise it wasn't. When I would write a paper for school, he would just, and this is we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. He would go, "Everything on the first page is crapola, don't use it."

(00:19:30):
And he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just like, "Oh, it's crap. I don't care about that." So, I would do that and then just get other people, there's probably somebody around you that's good and find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it, me and two other women who are product leaders, and we oftentimes send each other our work still and we say, "Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?" And we do that for each other. So, find a peer maybe who's in a non-competitive space who can do that for you. I mean I still use those people to help me.

Lenny (00:20:10):
That is extremely cool. Can you talk more about this group that you have?

Maggie Crowley (00:20:15):
Yeah, I don't know if it's a group. It's like three friends. Shout out Alexa and Daphne. Yeah, I mean the three of us all worked together when we were at Drift. We've stayed in touch and I've just found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback, and the more senior you get, the harder that is. And so having people who can give you another point of view who maybe you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader who can give you other experiences that they're going through has been incredibly valuable. And so we just have a little group chat that is focused on product.

Lenny (00:20:49):
That is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone that wants to create something like this? Is it important for you to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip.

Maggie Crowley (00:21:00):
Slack just worked for us where we are during the day, and I think having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a literal group text. There are small community, there's one, I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit, and there's a Slack community that somebody organized for heads of products and healthcare startups that is similar to those really, really powerful and a really great space to be in. And so you just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people and there's people around you who are going to become your friends, and so keep an eye out for them and keep in touch with them when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little Slack workspace.

Lenny (00:21:39):
Oh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described as following up on results, is it just do that. Is there anything more you can add there?

Maggie Crowley (00:21:49):
I put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But if you're launching a product, usually you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and you're maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it, then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing, and you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that.

Lenny (00:22:20):
And is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs, that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything, or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact or is it both?

Maggie Crowley (00:22:36):
It's definitely both. I'm not going to pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're going to get what you want. Just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job getting results. If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I am of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't want to leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So, I would suggest doing it for both reasons. And that's one of those things that people want to pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always going to get what we want and always going to get that promotion, but you have to work for it.

Lenny (00:23:22):
I love that point. It reminds me what I find one of the most important traits of a great product manager is they create this aura that they've got this, they put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. And this connects to me there. They feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.

Maggie Crowley (00:23:45):
Yeah, that's a really good point. And then you mentioned this a little bit ago, the side benefit is that you learn more. You will go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen, and the more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is family shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.

Lenny (00:24:19):
There's a lot of people that are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM. They're not moving off the ladder like, oh my god, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience, it took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?

Maggie Crowley (00:24:40):
I would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. It was after business school and I left those two years thinking, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff, I'm good. Went to a startup, there was another product person there, they left and I was the only product person at the startup. And I realized really quickly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making. That's why I joined Drift is because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn.

(00:25:29):
And so then two more years. So, that's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. And that's because it takes a long time to ship stuff. And so to people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping, you can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me staying at that, when I was at Drip, I was there for almost four years. I got to see two or three cycles of the same product and I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions and that's rare. And people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted, of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious. Lots of people are ambitious, but for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful and I think allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or a product versus just bounce and track a bunch of different companies or depends?

Maggie Crowley (00:26:39):
It depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, many people have done it, but I was surprised at how much I value that experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because you don't hear that point of view as much or as I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the sort of arc of my career, but I'm glad that I did it. And then of course people always want to get promoted, always ask that question and my answer is always create impact and that can take time.

Lenny (00:27:16):
At my first job, I was there for nine years and then I started a company for a year and a half and then we sold to Airbnb, and then I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep and I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons. Okay. Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the water, I think is how you described it.

Maggie Crowley (00:27:42):
Yeah. This one, there's no tips and tricks. It's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.

(00:28:17):
Because we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going. And it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. And part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that, whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:28:55):
It reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared, in one of your podcast episodes. It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt it's your job as a PM, which I think relates very much to which it just shared. Can you speak to that?

Maggie Crowley (00:29:12):
It might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that are part of the team. So, as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this down and build the thing and make it work to spec. As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the user experience. Obviously there's lots more complexity in that role. Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TLDR, caveat, whatever. But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?

(00:29:41):
It's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one-pager. That's not true. Your job isn't just to pick the problem. Your job is to deliver a business result. And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one else is incentivized to do that. As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it, and the good ones care, but you don't have to care. As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for the customer or the user at the end of the day. And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.

Lenny (00:30:17):
It reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot of the PM job sucks. It's not as glamorous as people often think, and most of the job is these really boring, annoying things. I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just a lot of people want to get into PM, they're like, oh, I'm going to run the show. It's going to be so great. I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do. But that's not how it is.

Maggie Crowley (00:30:41):
It's just one of those things that people, and when I joined product, it was just sort of becoming a cool job. It wasn't the hot job on campus when I was in business school. That was more private equity, venture capital. And now there's a sense of cachet around it. But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do cool stuff. You get to decide what gets built. That's cool. You have a lot of ownership like we talked about. You could see it as you have a lot of power, but at the same time you're responsible.

(00:31:12):
And so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door. And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do. Again, project management is one everyone hates on. QA is a really good one. You should QA your products. That's great if you have a QA team, you should QA them. You should know how they work. You should implement with your customers, you should be able to sell them, you should be able to find users. All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do, and none of it is above you.

Lenny (00:31:42):
If someone is listening and they're not a PM and they are not convinced to not get into product manager, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for selling that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product management?

Maggie Crowley (00:31:55):
I thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack workspace team. Because it's been a long time since I've tried to get into product. And so I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard and I don't know if things have changed. I went to business school and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there, big tech companies, if you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. And so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who switched laterally within a company. Again, challenging but can be done. Or people who joined startups. So, when I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. And I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work.

(00:32:49):
The reason why people don't do it is because as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. And what we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. And I loved every second of it, and I wish I could do that again and again and again. But to get that, she basically just hounded me. Christina, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot. We talked a lot and we waited until the time was right and then you finally convinced me to do it. So, I don't know. I don't if there's a reliable path that I can say this is what my advice would be other than try a startup network. See what you can do.

Lenny (00:33:33):
And you've made up this point elsewhere, which I think is an additional key piece is once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I'm just like, I look at a resume like, oh, they've never been a PM. This isn't the role. It's rarely that someone wants someone that's never been a PM.

Maggie Crowley (00:33:51):
Yeah. And I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product. And that's one of the things I always tell them because if they're deciding between roles and they have an opportunity to do something, and my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it. Because to your point, it's what we screen on. It's for better or for worse, it's just like you have to get that first job. And then once you get that first job, it all gets easier. You can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then the second question I have is, what have you shipped? So, it's like, have you been at PM before? What have you shipped? And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question. And the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.

Lenny (00:34:36):
Let's shift topics and talk about product strategy. Many people are told you need to get better product strategy. You're not great at strategy. A lot of people are also just confused, what is strategy? How do I get better at strategy? How do we describe a strategy? And you have a really great explanation and overview of how to think about this stuff. So, I'd love to hear your take on just how do you actually write out and describe a strategy.

Maggie Crowley (00:35:04):
Sure, yeah. And another thing that happens, and I'll give the outline, but another thing I hear, especially as you get further in your career, and unfortunately if you're maybe an underrepresented person in tech, is that you need to be more strategic. And so that's feedback that almost always happens, especially if you're a woman in product, in tech who's knocking at the door of a leadership role. You've probably gotten that feedback. And so I made it my mission to figure out what the heck is this thing? How do I do it? How can I do it in a way that is demonstrable so that I'm never getting that feedback that's like, oh, she's not strategic. And so what I did was something that I kind of did in the background because I had an engineer who I worked with who really wanted to understand why we were doing what we were doing, and he was not satisfied with sort of a surface level answer.

(00:35:57):
And he was just pushing and pushing and pushing. And so what I did was I just wrote out a Google doc and I started with like, okay, and not fancy, these are just bullets. What is the mission? What is the point of the company? What are our goals? Maybe we have some sort of high level framing of what we're working on. And then I had this big section that was just the landscape. And in that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing. Just dump that all on paper. Then what are the current quarters business goals or however you do planning, what are the current things that your company's working on? Then I put in, all right, that's sort of the context that we're operating in.

(00:36:44):
Then I wanted to understand where are we. So what is an honest accounting of the current state of your product, the business overall, and then the specific area that you're working in. What works, what doesn't work? What are your customers saying? Bottoms up feedback, users, customers, teams, what are your support tickets? Get that all out on paper. And then really importantly, where are your technical hurdles? What are the big pieces of tech debt? What are your engineering and technical teams always harping on that they want to invest in? Are there some big things coming down the pipe that you need to think about? Just get everything on paper. And then usually in the process of writing all that down, you'll start to see, okay, I kind of get where we are. I kind of get what the challenge is. And then you write a section that's like, what's the opportunity?

(00:37:34):
From all of that, what's going to bubble up as the top one or two opportunities for your team? Where do you want to play? Where can you win? Where's the unique? Based on your unique competitive advantage, where do you think you all should be and why? And then based on that opportunity, what are the challenges? So, what's going to be the hardest about taking advantage of that? What has to be, another way to frame it is what has to be true about the world for that to work? That's a one that's been helpful. And then what would you do? Take a swing at writing down your solution, what you would need to build, how might it work? Anything that you have, this is where I would say three bullets, maybe what you might want to do and then a plan. If no one else had an opinion, how would you go about it?

(00:38:26):
How would you sequence it? What would you do? How might you get the team to work on it? What would your team have to look like? How much would it cost to do it? All that you can start to layer in all that kind of stuff. And then I just share the doc. Share it with everybody. There should not be any secret. And you should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there. And if anyone doesn't agree with it, they can call out where their disagreement lands in that landscape. But at least then you've put everything on paper, you understand how you got to where you're going, and then you can have an argument about the different pieces and points of data and feedback that you're getting, but at least people understand how you got where you got. And then it doesn't become like, I don't agree with you. It becomes, I don't agree with this point.

Lenny (00:39:18):
This is such a cool way of doing it. By the way, is there a template that we can point people to that has this sort of-

Maggie Crowley (00:39:23):
There's not, I've only ever done it in a loose Google doc and then it just grows and changes. I can maybe try to write up those bullets, but it's just like I just make headers and then I just start dumping content in it.

Lenny (00:39:36):
Yes, that's all people need. If you end up creating that before this comes out, we'll throw it in the show notes. And if not, people can just bother you on Twitter and ask Maggie, where's that template that we talked about?

Maggie Crowley (00:39:44):
Yeah, I'm happy to write it on a piece of paper and take a photo of it and send it around.

Lenny (00:39:49):
There you go. Just make it really grainy and an artifact. We found Maggie's template. This is awesome. So, I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape, and I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from you just don't have the same information or the manager, exec or whatever doesn't think you have the information. So, if you just lean into, here's everything that I know and here's what's happening, and if you disagree with this goal, tell me, and then it'll change the plan.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:40:18):
And yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:18):
Part of it's also that typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. So, I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy for example, you don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback, don't overcomplicate it, just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or doing it better than I'm doing it.

(00:41:11):
So, I was like, okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you run in with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and if people cared to engage with it was there.

Lenny (00:41:33):
So, along those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be depending either on the timescale, say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year, how many pages should this doc be as any guide?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:46):
It's long. It gets real long.

Lenny (00:41:48):
What is long?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:53):
The actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto principle. I end up doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that there's one, within the first, above the fold, if you will. You can kind of get the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be, should be customizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics, interesting technological changes that are happening. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies marketing websites and dumping that in there. And that might be some interesting comments. So, it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.

Lenny (00:42:37):
And you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory if they want to really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing everything and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like this is actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.

Maggie Crowley (00:42:58):
It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place. And that's for me. So, it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that my, especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the doc because they're pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.

(00:43:28):
And so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too. And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say, yeah, that looks great, or You're dumb, I hate this. And okay, sure. There's always those people. So, it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.

Lenny (00:43:58):

Is there an example of a strategy you were thinking about recently or that you worked on in the past just to give people something concrete of like here's what Maggie thinks of as a question she's going to develop a strategy around?

Maggie Crowley (00:45:28):
Yeah, I think, obviously this is where product content gets really challenging because obviously I can't really talk about the stuff I'm currently working on.

Lenny (00:45:36):
Just tell us all of the secrets. And that [inaudible 00:45:38] know.

Maggie Crowley (00:45:38):
The toast PR department would be really unhappy with me. It's questions like, if you're a director of product somewhere, maybe you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going to do next year? How do you answer that question? How do you back up your choices for that? You use a doc like this. Maybe you are realizing that the product that you're working on doesn't really matter, it's not really making an impact. You're kind of treading water. I would use this as a tool to figure out, okay, well what else could you do? So, yeah, quarterly planning, annual planning. If you feel like your team needs to make a pivot or if you think that there's a really interesting new opportunity that your business or your team should go after, is another time I might use something like this.

Lenny (00:46:30):
Awesome. This reminds me a little bit of, I keep mentioning this chat with Bill Carr that I had who is an early Amazon exec and how the narrative approach at Amazon, one of the benefits of that and the reasons they go there is partly for you to realize this is a bad idea before anyone even needs to give you feedback. And that's why they force you to write six pages in depth about your idea and then it goes in these concentric circles through the company. And idea is like, here's okay, and this is just not a good idea. Here's all the reasons why. So, I think there's a lot of similarities there.

Maggie Crowley (00:47:00):
Yeah, there are many, many times when if you combine this artifact and process with the point about simplification where through that process you just start cutting so many things because then what happens is, let's say you've gone through this exercise and you're like, okay, I know exactly what my three things are that I want to work on. Then there's a moment where you take the strategy and then you look at your roadmap and they're never the same. And the roadmap is just bloated with all of this random stuff that like, oh, well, we have to do that because of this, or we have to do that because of that.

(00:47:37):
This thing we're still working on, this is like six months delayed, so we're still going to do the thing. And then all of a sudden you've got 90% of your resources committed to things that don't track against your strategy. And it's a really interesting moment as a leader especially to sit there and go, well, what do we do? What do you do when you have that problem? And especially if you're a PM, you probably don't have the agency to say, scrap the entire roadmap and work on my new strategy. But at least it allows you to think about critically about whether you should be doing what you're doing and allows you to evaluate whether those things are still the most important things to work on.

Lenny (00:48:09):
I'm going to summarize the template real quick, and then I'm going to have another question kind of along the lines. So, if you're trying to create your own little template, you start with the mission of the business, and then I imagine you also share the mission of your team because oftentimes it's a little more specific, if you're working on it like a product team strategy. Then there's a landscape of what's happening. So, you include competitive, SWOT analysis of competition risks, product state, business state, things like that.

(00:48:38):
And then you share the current goals of what you're trying to achieve as a team slash business. And there's an account, honest accounting of what's happening in the product and technical hurdles and things like that that'll keep you from moving, I guess, achieving some of these goals. And then you share, here's the opportunity I see, how we win and how we actually achieve this opportunity where we place bets and things like that, or we could place bets. Then challenges of doing this, what needs to be true for this to be possible? And then you finally get to, here's what I think we should do, essentially the solution, ideally three bullet points, and then the plan. And I imagine the plan is step one, get sign off from exec. Step two, resource the team. Step three, start on this design research sprint.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:26):
Pretty much.

Lenny (00:49:26):
Awesome. All right. Amazing. Somebody will create this template if you don't end up doing it.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:49:32):
There's another-

Maggie Crowley (00:49:32):
I hope somebody does.

Lenny (00:49:34):
Okay. That'd be awesome. If they do, I will tweet it and we put it in the show notes.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:34):
Great.

Lenny (00:49:39):
So many promises already from this podcast. Along the same lines, you also have a one-pager template and process that I think people find really useful. So, how about we chat about that one briefly and then I'm going to go in a whole different direction.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:52):
Okay. Yeah, I don't think I have much to say about this. That has not been said by many people many times, but whether it's a spec, a PRD, a one pager, I don't even know what else people call it. It's the document that you use to define the thing that you're doing as a product team, and that means product design, engineering, your little squad. And what I think is really useful about this process is that it's the PM's artifact. So, designers produce designs, engineers write code. What do PMs do? A lot of people might say nothing. In theory, we write at least this document and it can be a pain. I've seen lots of ways where it hasn't been done very well, but when I think it's done really well and when it's really effective is it's a tool that allows the PM to start with why. And if you structure it correctly, the most important section in my opinion in the document is the first part, which is like what is the background and context?

(00:51:00):
What is the problem, why does it matter and why does it matter now? And if you get those things right, the rest gets really easy, but it gives you a chance as a PM to center the team around the problem, why that problem exists, whether it's created by your own product or it's something the user is experiencing and why that problem is worth solving. That's a part that I think people sometimes forget to think about and why it's we're solving right now versus all the other problems you could be solving and then it can become the home base of the decisions that you make along the way. So, I think it's best when you have those sections and then also best when you write down on this day, we made this decision or we decided not to do this or we decided only to solve this part of the problem, not this part of the problem. Keeping a running list of that and a link off to all the different artifacts and research and things is helpful for a team.

Lenny (00:51:52):
So, just to summarize, what would be the headings again, just if someone's taking notes and wants to create the rule template?

Maggie Crowley (00:51:57):
I don't think these templates have to be really complicated. It's like background and context. The problem. I would literally write why this problem matters and why this problem matters now. Don't make it complicated, just answer those questions and if you can do that, and then again, it's only really helpful if then you bring that document before you go any further to your team and you use it to have a conversation and you get the smart people around you to take shots at it. I should have mentioned this earlier with the strategy. The first person I go to is typically speaking my engineering counterpart and I say, shred this, go through it, rip it apart, vomit comments on it, tear this down how it gets better. And as a PM you can't be precious about your work. You need people to poke holes in it.

Lenny (00:52:48):
The why this matters now point is so interesting. I don't often hear that and I think it's such an important part of specs and plans and strategies because there's so many things you can do and there's certain things that are perishable that you can only do now. That if you don't do now you miss up the opportunity. And so I think that's a really interesting element that most people don't include and it reminds me of, I think I've done enough podcast episodes now where I'm just connecting all these things as people are talking. [inaudible 00:53:16] the John Nash thing happening where Karri, the founder of Linear talked about this concept of side quests as a founder. Because he's so good at staying focused and I was just like, "How do you stay focused and just get stuff done when you have so many people coming out?" He's just like, "There's the main quest and then there's the side quests and side quest I don't need to do right now. There's the main quest which is build up really successful business." And I feel like this is a good example of that in action.

Maggie Crowley (00:53:39):
Yeah, I love his take on quality and taste too.

Lenny (00:53:43):
Yeah. What a gem.

Maggie Crowley (00:53:44):
Yeah, big fan of that. But yeah, I mean it's really hard to stay disciplined, it's hard to stay focused and to your point, there's a million things you could do at any given time, especially if you work at a bigger company. And so the why now is an important question to answer because if not, somebody's going to ask you. So, you may as well think about it.

Lenny (00:54:02):
Yeah, it's interesting why now comes up a lot in investing in startups but rarely in product building and it feels like it should. Although I will say in the research I've done, why now ends up not being that important for startups being successful or not. So, I think there's a two sides to that coin. Anyway, I'm going to move on to a different topic and this might become a new thing that we do and I'm going to call it contrarian corner. I asked you if you have contrarian opinions about things before we started recording this episode and you had some really good ones. So, there's a couple topics I'm going to chat about and we'll see if this becomes a recurring theme and you're laughing and nodding your head, what are you thinking as I say this?

Maggie Crowley (00:54:39):
I'm thinking about when I had a podcast, you would do a show on a topic and we would click the end recording button and then every single guest would be like, I had no idea what I was doing. I made it all up, it was waterfall. None of that matters. I didn't know what I was ... People would say the wildest stuff and I would sit there as a PM and just think what. We just talked about this framework, we just talked about this thing and that's how you're supposed to do it. And then they would get off the official part and just say, yeah, it's wild. Nothing goes the way you want it to go. We're all just kind of making it up as we go. And so I hope that you get more of those takes in this part of the show.

Lenny (00:55:18):
I'm very sensitive to that point right now because someone just tweeted about how they're just finding that many of my newsletter posts about how companies write product are the ideal version of what they do and I rarely or they rarely share, here's all the challenges we're having, which I think there's truth to that, but I also get into a lot of failures on this podcast. Actually, I think the podcast is a lot more of just here's things that go wrong versus the newsletter. So, I'm just like shit, I need to do more of that. So, I love that you mentioned that and let's see what we can get into. But I guess maybe before we get there, is there an example of something that didn't go just along the lines of some sort of failure slash mistake?

Maggie Crowley (00:55:59):
I might be foreshadowing, but a question I ask in every product interview is what's the worst product you've ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty, you just haven't had enough reps, you haven't done it enough time. And it's not only that you've done it but that you can admit it and which one it is. That's so important. And I remember, it was so dumb, I'm still so mad about this, that we did this. I won't name which team, which company, I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we needed to do a rewrite, red flag number one of a existing product and engineer who I'd worked with many times. We had a really good relationship and this person was like, yeah, yeah, it's going to take six months, no problem.

(00:56:47):
Core part of the product been around for forever. One of those things that the code is still, it's still the code written by the founders kind of thing. It didn't take six months, it took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never, it went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to get to feature parody. It was the worst project. So, many people rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb, sunk cost fallacy, just the worst. And it's because A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it. B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one-pager, we just went for it. We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements would actually have to be. And there you have it.

Lenny (00:57:34):
And did not work out or was it a huge success in the end and it changed the trajectory of the business?

Maggie Crowley (00:57:39):
Absolutely not. But you know what, I didn't get fired, so it's fine.

Lenny (00:57:43):
I feel like I've gone through those experiences and then three, four years later it's like another, maybe this rewrite and redesign may work because we haven't updated this thing in a long time.

Maggie Crowley (00:57:52):
Just don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side by side re-write, nope.

Lenny (00:57:59):
Yeah, what I run into is once you get too far down a redesign slash rewrite everyone's building in that new world and then you launch an experiment's negative and then it's just like, oh, we just got to launch it. We're going to claw back. We're going to get figure out how to get back to neutral someday.

Maggie Crowley (00:57:59):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:15):
Yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:58:15):
Yeah. Don't do that.

Lenny (00:58:16):
Good times. Okay, well maybe we'll start a failure corner. That could be a new segment. We may have a little sound and theme music, but this time we have contrarian corner and you have a couple contrarian opinions about a couple topics. The first is product management. What is something that you believe about product management that maybe other people are less convinced by?

Maggie Crowley (00:58:39):
The one I like to have in this area is that people who are really excited about being data-driven, to me that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking, especially if it's an executive who's saying things like, oh, so we make all our decisions with our dashboards. To me that says that the team is over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data and they're not using good judgment. They probably don't do a lot of direct user research. They don't really understand the humans who are using the thing, what they need, what they care about, and they're managing via a dashboard. And maybe if they got really, really good at picking metrics, it would be fine. And oftentimes maybe it is fine. Maybe you have a high volume business that's really easy to run experiments on and that works for you. But most PMs, most jobs, most products, you're going to be better off talking to 10 users and you'll get more and better insights out of why things are happening than you would with any dashboard.

Lenny (00:59:51):
So, the takeaway there is just be careful when someone is saying they're super data-driven. Our team is super data-driven or company company's super data-driven.

Maggie Crowley (01:00:00):
Yeah, and maybe it's true and that's great. I am not saying that you don't need data. You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that, you need to know why. It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening, I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next. One quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was a VP [inaudible 01:00:24] at TripAdvisor, we were in a room, just had this meeting called product review that was amazing when I first joined and someone was justifying this project and he just, I hope he is okay with me saying this because this is my memory of this moment.

(01:00:38):
He was just like, this is an obviously better thing. Just do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop doing all the stuff that you're doing. Stop with these numbers, whatever it was that they were doing, if it's obviously better, if it's logically better, use your good judgment and do that thing and let's move on. And I've always thought about that, but you can just do the obviously better thing.

Lenny (01:00:58):
Yeah, I love that I pull that card sometimes, but I think you almost have to do it that way of just like, okay, everyone, this one's just obviously a good idea. Let's just do it. Enough research. Okay, another topic that you have some interesting opinions about his product content very close to our hearts, both my heart and your heart. Do share.

Maggie Crowley (01:01:20):
Really if you're going to make good content, you have to sanitize and frameworkize the thing that you're working on. And then slowly, I think for a lot of people who are reading it and looking at it, their thinking starts to become, well look how well I did this framework. Look how well I implemented this thing. And they lose touch with the point which is creating impact. And so all of this content makes it really noisy and then makes people think that, oh, if I just do these things that I'll get what I want. And now I'll just check off my list and then I checked it off and then I should get my promotion at the end of the day. But it's like the best PMs have built up so many different frameworks and they can apply them in different ways. And then sometimes they throw them out and they say, nothing I have in my toolkit makes sense for this moment, but I know what to do because I have intuition and I have data and I've talked to users or whatever.

(01:02:16):
And so content sometimes can get in the way of the impact because you're trying to apply it and you think that the point is the framework and the point is the one pager or whatever it is that you're doing when it's not. And then if you're a leader and maybe if you've had the good and ill fortune of having published content, someone comes to you and says, well, you said in that one podcast episode that you don't believe in roadmaps, so why are you asking me for a roadmap? And then you're the who's sitting there being like, well, it's a little more complicated than that. And that was a fun take that I had, but I actually need to understand what we're doing because planning and I need to figure out what my budget is, blah, blah, blah.

Lenny (01:02:52):
That's so funny that I didn't think about you as a leader having put stuff out that people put back at you. And I think your point about one for you, for people to consume content online about how to do product management, you have to really distill it. And to your point, it often loses the nuance. Because if you had all the ones, no one's going to even read it so complicated and long. And then the other point of there's also just it has to be interesting. So, if it's another just like, here's how a roadmap really is successfully and it's like what everyone's already done, no one's going to read it. So, you always have to have a new take. And with that comes, it's not actually always true. I just wanted people to react to this idea.

Maggie Crowley (01:03:32):
Yeah, I mean it's helpful. I think there's some people who create, I mean there's many things at my last role, we all had your newsletter and we listened to the show and then people would bring, I should have found a clip, but I can't remember, there were a couple of moments where we would listen to a piece of it or find an article and say, oh, this could help. Or what if we did it that way? I think there was a newsletter article about Figma and they had some templates. They're like product review template for FigJam. Love that one. Use that one all the time.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Amazing.

Maggie Crowley (01:04:06):
So, yeah, I mean the stuff's really useful. It's just like you have to be smart about when you apply it. And then if you're a leader and there's all this content available, you have to know why you're not following the rules.

Lenny (01:04:18):
If they're just like, hey, look at this newsletter post letting you write, we should be doing it this way. Versus I think people assume these are the one way to do it or innately will work at your company. And I really like your point, which maybe counter to what I do, but I think it's an important nuance that I feel like I should add to every newsletters. This isn't necessarily going to work at your company. Sometimes the culture is different and this won't fit or this isn't a complete version. As much as I try to give people, here's everything you need to do this thing well, there's always a little bit missing

Maggie Crowley (01:04:55):
And I think if you don't have that context, it can be a little demoralizing like, well, how am I ever going to do that thing that they get to do at this magical company? But again, if you view it as more like here all the tools that you can add to your toolkit and you pull them out when you're in a situation from which they can be useful, that's how I think about it. Versus this is the one way to do it like you said, the only way you can write a one page or the only way you can write an experiment, it's more like you can do it in many different ways.

Lenny (01:05:19):
And I find myself, I'm not actually, I rarely tell people here's the way to do it. Usually what I try to describe is here's how the best companies do it, as much as I can get into and leave it to the reader to decide is this going to be a fit for me, should I try to implement it? But still, I think there's an implication. This is the way to do research, here's the way to do roadmap, here's the way to prioritize. But I think it's interesting that you also, yourself create a lot of content and you actually found a lot of value from being, let's not call you content creator because I don't like being labeled as a creator myself.

Maggie Crowley (01:05:55):
Someone one's called me a product influencer and I'll died like a little bit.

Lenny (01:05:59):
That's how I feel. I'd love to hear just the impact you've seen from spending time creating podcasts and blog posts and tweeting about really great stuff because a lot of people are thinking about investing in this stuff.

Maggie Crowley (01:06:11):
Yeah, it's probably the best thing I've ever done for my career and I am so grateful for the people whose idea it was, who supported me and especially at Drift, when that became such a part of what we were doing at that time. And it's been helpful for a couple of reasons. One is just networking and access. I probably wouldn't be here today if I hadn't done that and if a friend of a friend had read the thing, it's like it just creates so many more connections. And so access to people and networking is one of the first benefits.

(01:06:51):
Also building a personal brand is really helpful if you want, one of the things that I always wanted to do with my career is try to make it so that I'm always employable. I just didn't want to, I'm an 08 grad not to put my age out there, and it was a hard time. And so I've always had this in the back of my mind, you want to be able to have a solid career. And so I thought that investing in my personal brand would be a way to help me get access to roles. It helps in recruiting as well when I'm trying to hire people. Because a lot of my job now is bringing people in and because I've been vocal about how I like to work and who I am, a lot of people and they will send me a note and say, I want to work with you, or I want to work on a team like that.

(01:07:35):
And that's huge because if my job is to hire people, then that's great and people can get a sense of who I am without needing to be on the phone with me. My favorite benefit outside of those things has been that it's helped me learn more from the work I've done than I otherwise would've been able to. Because in order to make content, you have to think through what you did, you have to summarize it, process it, make it interesting for people. And then especially if it's in a podcast meeting, talk to somebody about it. And the process of doing that means that you're paying attention to what you're learning along the way. And so often we don't do that because we're busy working, we have our lives, things are happening. And that to me is, I think what's made me a better product person faster is because I spent the time to think about what I was doing in a way that I wouldn't have if I didn't have to write something down.

Lenny (01:08:28):
Something that comes across in your content that you've somehow figured out is to avoided being cringy and very thirsty for followers. And I think when a lot of people here build a personal brand, it's like, I don't want to.

Maggie Crowley (01:08:44):
I know. It makes me ill even saying that, it's like too gross.

Lenny (01:08:47):
I never thought of it or wanted to think of it that way. And I'm just curious what advice you'd give to people that want to go down this route without feeling, I guess one, is just feeling like they're being cringey, and two, avoiding content people be like, oh my God, I can't believe this stuff [inaudible 01:09:02].

Maggie Crowley (01:09:02):
Yeah, the clickbait tweet thread situation. I think the step one's going to be cringe. Your first 10, 20, however many posts are going to be bad. I would imagine if you went back and listened to your first episode, you would be cringing just because you've learned so much since then. Right?

Lenny (01:09:02):
Yeah.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:22):
It's natural.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Although randomly the first episode ever is the most popular episode. So, with [inaudible 01:09:29], which I could see why it was so popular.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:30):
So, it went really hot with your first guest.

Lenny (01:09:34):
That's right. That's right.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:35):
So, yeah, first get over the fact that it's going to be cringe. It's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started and it'll fade away eventually and you don't have to think about it. Two B, this is such gross advice, but you have to be authentic. It has to be real. And I think what came through in the show that I did was those were my real questions that I was really working on.

(01:09:59):
So, we joked about how we would turn off the recording and then we would get the real story, but I would turn the recording off and I would say, okay, we talked about this thing. Here's actually happening in my job today, what would you do? And so those were real questions that I had, real processes that I was working on and real advice that I needed at that time. And I think that's why it was valuable is because I was actively a PM and the way that I'm still actively in product, that was always something that I wanted because it meant that the content had to be relevant for me and wasn't just for likes and share.

Lenny (01:10:34):
I think there's some two really important points there that stood out to me. One is your stuff's going to be terrible if you don't actually have any background or experience in the things, you're just pretending. It's like you're acting like someone that knows about this thing, but you don't actually. And so I think that's an incredibly important part of this is don't try to become an online creator person if you haven't done the thing, because people will see that you don't know what you're really talking about and you'll run out of stuff and it'll be like, okay, well I did it for two months and I have nothing more to say.

Maggie Crowley (01:11:03):
Right.

Lenny (01:11:05):
And then the other piece is there's a guest who shared this quote that has stuck with me from Einstein, which is something like, "Seek not to be successful but of value." And I find that that's a really good framing for sharing stuff is just share things that are interesting to you and useful and come at it from this is useful, not from, I'm trying to build a following. Because people can tell if that's the-

Maggie Crowley (01:11:30):
Yeah, people can absolutely tell. And the other thing is there's a little bit of too cool for school mixed in here and there are definitely people who will tell you your content is cringe or make fun of you or whatever because that's what they want to do. And I'm not even going to get into psychology of that, but people will do that. And I've always been of the mind that the really interesting people out there, people who are unashamedly interested in stuff and who are like, yeah, I'm nerding out about this and I'm sharing it because I'm interested in it. And for better for worse, I love working in product. I love the job.

(01:12:08):
Even all the gross stuff you have to do, it's super interesting. You meet really cool people, you get to ship stuff, you get to see the stuff get used by people and solve problems. It's a really cool job and I've always been interested in how to do it better and it doesn't matter to me that some people might think that's cringe because that's cool, but this is what I do all day long, so I'd like to get better at it.

Lenny (01:12:26):
I think that's such a big part of it. I didn't even mention that. Just it needs to feel really authentic and clearly for you is just like, there's just stuff I want to share because it's really interesting to me.

Maggie Crowley (01:12:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:12:37):
The way I actually started writing was exactly the two reasons you just shared. One is I wanted to learn the thing and so writing helped me figure things out. And then two is I just thought it was interesting and I found it useful and I just assumed other people might find it useful. So, I did also learn, and I wonder if you found this too, is that you think the things are not going to be that interesting or useful to people, so basic for you, but people find the most basic stuff so interesting. Because there's always more to learn about how to roadmap, how to prioritize, how to hire, how to talk, to have difficult conversations, performance review.

Maggie Crowley (01:13:15):
All of that is absolutely true. And I think one of the first pieces of content that I was really happy with was I was working with somebody and they were making a PowerPoint presenter slides or whatever, and I just wrote out in my notebook like, okay, here's how I do that. I start with an outline on paper and then I draw little boxes for the slides and I write out the headline of the slides. And then once I have a tight outline and I have the literal text that will go across the top of each of those things, then I sketch out how I want the slides to go. And then I go into Google Docs and I actually make the slide.

(01:13:51):
And it was like some silly little thing and this person sat there and said, holy, you just totally changed the way I did this and this took me 75% less time than it would've taken me otherwise. And I was like, I may do this dumb drawing. Why is this a big deal? And yeah, that's when I realized that the stuff that's easy for you might be a stuff that is most interesting because it's something that maybe you're really good at that you don't realize.

Lenny (01:14:13):
I think people need to really internalize that point. If there's something that you're doing that you consistently find useful and works often, that is going to be really useful for someone to hear. So, that could be a good place to start. Maggie, we've gone through everything that I was hoping to get through and more, which is awesome.

Maggie Crowley (01:14:32):
Great.

Lenny (01:14:32):
Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or touch on think might be useful to leave folks with?

Maggie Crowley (01:14:41):
My hope is always that people listen to stuff like this and realize that it's messier than you think you can fail a lot and still be successful and that they should have fun. I think that gets missed in a lot of the product content is like, have fun, enjoy it. People are weird, people do weird stuff and you build stuff for people, which it makes it all very entertaining. So, I've always found a lot of joy in the job.

Lenny (01:15:04):
And to your point of carrying the water as a PM where you're kind of doing all the things, it's like you can create that fun. You can make the team your own fun and change the culture, create the culture. I find that so underappreciated for PM.

Maggie Crowley (01:15:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny (01:15:17):
Okay, well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Maggie Crowley (01:15:21):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:15:22):
Maggie, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Maggie Crowley (01:15:27):
First, most common one is probably the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, the little tiny one, really great way to improve your speaking skills and your presentation skills and to get distracted executives to agree with the point you're making. So, that's one. Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke is the second one. Coming back to the point about being able to make bets, I think that one's a really interesting one. And then bonus third one, this is more like a desk reference that I now have on my desk, the Scaling People book by Claire Hughes Johnson. I really enjoyed the way that one is working and it just sits on my desk and I reference it every once in a while, especially as manager.

Lenny (01:16:11):
I have it both under my laptop right where I'm sitting and then also way behind there and it's one of the most popular episodes I've done with Claire, so if folks haven't listened to that one. Highly recommend. She's incredible. Great choice. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Maggie Crowley (01:16:27):
Okay, so my husband is in the industry, as we say here in LA, and so we watch a lot of good and bad shows in TV, but I think my favorite one that I've watched recently was Slow Horses. Gary Oldman is incredible. Highly recommend.

Lenny (01:16:43):
Wow, I haven't heard that one yet. Good tip. What is a favorite interview question you really like to ask which I think you already gave away, but let's touch on it again.

Maggie Crowley (01:16:51):
I did. Yeah, it is what is the worst product that you've ever shipped? I think the best answers are ones, and I don't even care if someone listens to this and then I do this in an interview, people immediately laugh a little bit. They remember the horrible thing they did and then they share that horrible thing with you. And it tells me you have some humor, you're humble and you can point out when you've made a mistake. You've done enough to be able to confidently say, of course I've made a mistake. Because none of us are perfect. And you know how to spot those mistakes and you can learn from them. And I've always found that those conversations are the most interesting.

Lenny (01:17:29):
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Maggie Crowley (01:17:33):
One because I've seen you on Twitter, you're a future fit guy.

Lenny (01:17:36):
Yeah, I'm.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:37):
Is that correct?

Lenny (01:17:37):
I use it three times a week. I love it.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:39):
Yes. I was also a future fit person. I think it's great. It's a great product. I'm now on Ladder Fit.

Lenny (01:17:46):
I've heard of that.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:47):
And personally, I love not being, I don't have to talk to the coach every day. I don't need the accountability, so that's not a thing that I needed as an ex athlete. So, for me, that didn't serve me and I like the anonymity of it and it comes with a totally unhinged group chat for your whole team. It's fantastic. I'm really enjoying it.

Lenny (01:18:07):
Sweet.

Maggie Crowley (01:18:08):
So, that's one more of a funny one. And the second one, not to get real niche, but I think good products are products that are focused. They do one thing incredibly well and they're not, to your point about side quest, there's no side quests. I'm a new mom. There's this app called Pump Log. I have never seen an execute so well on one problem. There's not a single thing where I think, oh, I wish it did this. It does it. It's like I paid $14 for it. I've never paid for an app like that in my life.

Lenny (01:18:40):
Okay, I'm downloading it right after we finish. Do you have a favorite life motto that you either repeat yourself, often like to share with folks, find useful, and just kind of living life?

Maggie Crowley (01:18:51):
I'm sure there's mottos' I could say that would be aspirational mottos', but the real one is if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. And again, from being in sports to going to school to being in product, in my opinion, if you're going to do something, do it to the best of your ability because that's what you do with your day. You spend so much time working, you may as well be good at it or trying to get good at it. And that's always how I've lived my life.

Lenny (01:19:20):
I so love that message. I always think about that. Final question, you are an Olympic speed skater, which I don't think people would know necessarily. That's insane. My question is there some bad speed skating that would surprise people that would be like, what?

Maggie Crowley (01:19:38):
Ooh, that is one I've never been asked before. The whole experience, I've obviously learned a ton from it, and I think what might surprise people about being a small sport athlete is that you have to think in four or eight year chunks. And so it's one of those things where you grind for so long in a dark corner and then you get a chance to get the light to shine on you and you learn how to love the process. Especially for speed skating, I was a long track speed skater, it's a 400-meter rink.

(01:20:15):
You just are always turning left and going in a circle. There's not a lot going on. It's just you and your thoughts and you just really, really learn how to get good at perfecting something over and over again, and you learn how to grind, you learn how to focus, and I think it's also cool you get to go superfast. But yeah, I don't know if that would surprise people about speed skating, but I think just about being a small sport elite athlete, it's really about years and years and years of toiling and silence to get maybe one shot at something great.

Lenny (01:20:46):
So, much of what you just said would apply 100% to product management and I love that. Maggie, you are awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you any follow-up questions, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Maggie Crowley (01:21:00):
You can find me on Twitter for sure. By LinkedIn, but just speaking of cringe, I just can't get into LinkedIn posting.

Lenny (01:21:09):
LinkedIn's gotten better, I'd give it a shot. It's actually pretty interesting now, which sound weird to say.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:16):
Thinking about it, I better go back to work in a couple of weeks and thinking about LinkedIn. But yeah, Twitter for sure, LinkedIn for sure, and I've always tried to be helpful to other people, so I don't have an answer for how people can be helpful to me, my goal is really to share what I've been doing, the rooms that I get to be in, the access to the content and the people and the learning that I've had. So, hopefully I can find ways to keep sharing that.

Lenny (01:21:39):
Maybe check out Toast and use Toast when they're at restaurants.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:42):
Oh yes, Plug, Toast. Come work with us. We're the best. I get to work with John Cutler. It's phenomenal.

Lenny (01:21:50):
Legendary, previous guest. Are there roles you're hiring for just for folks that are listening and just like, hey, maybe I should go do that.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:56):
There are always roles that are open. I don't know what the most open roles are right now, but yeah, check it out. It's a great place.

Lenny (01:22:01):
Willing to the careers page.

Maggie Crowley (01:22:03):
Awesome.

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:03):
Manik Gupta has led two of the most successful consumer products in history: Google Maps, where he was director of product for the Maps team, and Uber where he was Chief Product Officer. After leaving Uber, he spent most of his time working on a product to help people avoid getting COVID, called CVKey, and most recently he took on a role at Microsoft as Corporate Vice President leading many of their consumer efforts.

(00:00:25):
In our conversation, we cover what he's learned about building successful consumer products, how to structure and higher product teams, building consumer apps, a concept called the consumer stack, company market fit versus product market fit, what it's like to be CPO, what he learned working at Microsoft versus Uber versus Google, and also a ton of career advice for anyone thinking about becoming a CPO someday. I hope that you enjoy this episode with Manik Gupta.

(00:01:57):
Hey, Casey Winters. What do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (00:02:00):
Coda is a company that's actually near and dear to my heart, because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, you know I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those Codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. They're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (00:02:36):
I actually use Coda myself every day. It's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement. Just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

(00:03:03):
Manik, welcome to the podcast.

Manik Gupta (00:03:06):
Thank you, Lenny. It's great to be here, man.

Lenny (00:03:08):
I don't know if it's obvious, but I am quite honored to have you on this podcast. You've had such an illustrious career as a founder leading the Google Maps team, as CPO at Uber for, I believe, four years. Now you're kind of a fancy VP at Microsoft on consumer stuff. It's this incredible career and trajectory. My first question is, looking back at your career, what would you say is maybe the one or two main things that you did that helped you get to where you are today? For folks that are maybe earlier in the career, of what they should be focusing on.

Manik Gupta (00:03:39):
Yeah. Thanks, Lenny, for having me. I'm also a big fan of yours, by the way. I love your newsletter and it's been incredible to just see how you have also grown both the set of topics that you cover and this podcast. Just really a big fan, so again, thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:03:54):
Appreciate that.

Manik Gupta (00:03:55):
Let me start by telling you a little bit about my philosophy of this. I'm maybe a little bit late to the party, but I recently read this book from Morgan Hausel on Psychology of Money. And I highly recommend your listeners read it if they get a chance. There's a chapter in there, he talks about luck and risk. What he says is, when you look at individuals and you think about, or you ask them, or you think about what they have done that have made them successful, we tend to put a greater amount of emphasis on effort and a little less emphasis on luck and risk. I think I strongly subscribe to that. The important thing when you look back is how much luck played a big part, and of course the risk that somebody took played a big part.

(00:04:45):
This is something that I've been thinking a lot about myself, which is what are some of the patterns of people who have had multiple careers and have gone through a journey where they've learned a lot and they've contributed and things like that? I think there are two patterns that stand out, both when I look at myself in terms of what I've been through, and also when I talk to a lot of my friends who have also gone on and done interesting things, and I wanted to cover both of that. The first one is really about people. It's about surrounding yourself with the best people you can find.

(00:05:16):
It was so funny. I was watching the Warriors game last night, and yeah Warriors, we won the NBA championship. That's great.

Lenny (00:05:22):
Go Warriors.

Manik Gupta (00:05:24):
One of the reporters, I think she asked Steve Kerr, the coach, "What's the secret?" And he goes, "Well just hang around superstars." That's what he said and he just passed the mic over to somebody else and said, "Look, this is a team that's hanging around superstars." And that's exactly what it is. If you're create enough opportunities, especially early on in your career as you asked, around hanging around people who are doing interesting things and they're doing things which really are different, or they're doing things in a different manner and it's exciting, the right things will happen.

(00:05:55):
I was lucky in a way that I caught myself in that situation. I grew up in India and when I was 16 I got a scholarship to move to Singapore to do my high school and then my undergrad studies. It just turned out that during those days, Singapore... I mean it still is, but it was a melting pot for the best and brightest folks that you can get from all over the Asia diaspora if you will. Among my colleagues and my fellow students there were a bunch of really, really smart people, so I just learned a lot from them and that gave me a great start to just go on and do something interesting. Right out of college, I started my own company and I did that with two of my classmates. One of them happens to be one of my best friends whom I grew up with who also came on the same scholarship with me to Singapore. We were just part of that ecosystem and it gave me a lot of opportunities to try out different things in college and so on and so forth.

(00:06:44):
I think the main thing that I would say here for people who are early in career is just surround yourself with people who are really good at what they do. Learn from them. And by the way, play the long game. Once you find someone like that, stick to them. As long as they want to hang out with you, but just stick to them. Because you will go on to do multiple things over your career with the same set of people. And the shared trust and experience that you build with A plus people is just going to go a long way. Anyway, that's pattern number one. I think that has helped me a lot and I also see a lot of that in other folks whom I talk to.

(00:07:19):
Then the second pattern is... This is something I resonate a lot with personally, is I'm a strong technology optimist. There's always a lot of narrative these days around technology and maybe a little bit more pessimism, and I find that bizarre. I'm just such a strong technology advocate and optimist, because I feel technology's such a strong force for good. I grew up as an engineer myself, and I've always been attracted to projects where we can use technology to solve a real human need. I did that with my startup, I did that at Hewlett-Packard, I did that at Google and at Uber as well. The passion that you get if you're a strong advocate of technology and how it can really help, it just gets you to choose a set of things that you want to do at scale.

(00:08:06):
For instance, when I joined Google in India to work on Maps, it was all about helping millions of users, around Asia particularly, navigate their world. There wasn't a good solution like that, so how can you bring technology to really solve those problems?

(00:08:21):
I think those are the two patterns, Lenny. One is surrounding yourself with A plus people, and the second is just having very strong optimism and passion about technology. At least if I connect their dots looking backwards, those are the things that have really helped me and a bunch of other folks that I see in a similar situation. I'm hoping that folks early in their career thing through that.

Lenny (00:08:40):
I bet there's a big overlap between those two points, technology optimist and just superstars. That's interesting.

Manik Gupta (00:08:46):
Yeah, there definitely is. That's actually really good. I hadn't thought about that. You're right. I think there's definitely that overlap, because folks who are in that mode, they really get around more together. I'm also an angel investor and an investor in a bunch of companies. Lenny, you and I have invested in a bunch of companies together as well. And it's like that. It's really about people who have the same kind of frequency in terms of thinking about the world outlook and they want to go on to do interesting things. I think that's really what drives the narrative forward.

Lenny (00:09:14):
Speaking of technology optimism and technology in general, of the things that you've worked on, what would you say you're most proud of project wise, product wise, feature wise?

Manik Gupta (00:09:23):
Yeah. Again, I've had just the incredible opportunity to be part of phenomenal companies that have created world changing products. I had a small, small, small part to play in that. I always emphasize that. It's not me, it was a team. And I really mean it. I'm not just saying it because I'm on your podcast, but it truly is. I'm particularly proud of the work that I did both at Google and at Uber. I'll give you a couple of examples to illustrate that point.

(00:09:47):
When I joined Google in India in 2008, I started off working on Google Maps and I remember how counterintuitive it was for anybody; my friends and family, a bunch of other folks whom I talked to. Counterintuitive in terms of why would anybody ever use maps on their mobile phone in India? The reason was because the norm was that, firstly, the country's unmappable because there's no good addressing system. So how do you even look at places? Then the second one was there were always people around that you can just roll down your car window and just ask people, "Hey, I'm going here and can you just give me guidance or directions?" That was the norm. That's how people navigated for a really long time.

(00:10:32):
When I started working on it, I think for me, my belief was, again going back to the tech optimism aspect, is why can't we in India have the same quality maps like we have in the United States? Why not? Why shouldn't we do it? Why are users here not getting the same benefit and same productivity gain, if you will, and less stress in their daily commute and things like that?

(00:10:55):
So we started building it. We started building the data. We went ahead and really mapped the country as much as we could. Both ourselves and through a lot of amazing work from our users who co-mapped the world with us. Over time, India became, I think, the second largest country for Google Maps in the world in terms of users. Of course, a lot of that happened because of Android. Android took off and Android had Google Maps on it. But it's just incredible to see how, in a short span of a few years, it just went up to becoming so useful. It's not that we were just distributing Google Maps on Android, people were using it. People were actually using it to go from point A to point B.

(00:11:35):
I feel really proud about that. I think the team did an incredible effort. It wasn't even a big team. It was a relatively small team, very passionate about going and doing this, and we made that happen.

(00:11:43):
Then at Uber, initially, before I took on the CPO role, I was leading maps and marketplace. When I was doing maps and marketplace, again, how do you get the ETA that you see on Uber when you open the Uber app and you request a car... The average ETA's went down to less than five minutes globally. Just think about that for a minute. In fact, it was 75 countries, more than 300 cities, if I remember correctly, where you could just open the Uber app and get an Uber in, average, less than five minutes. A lot of operational work need to happen for sure, but the technology, the marketplace technology especially to be able to connect the right rider to the right driver, have the mapping infrastructure underneath it to ensure that the car actually reaches you in that amount of time; I just feel very proud of all the work that happened during that time to make Uber really successful in terms of providing that kind of a service.

(00:12:37):
One fun anecdote I'll give you where my world came together and it just blows my mind even today, I remember I joined Uber in late 2015 and I made a trip to India to see my parents in sometime around 2016, 2017. I forget. It was around that time. And I was at home in Bangalore and I ordered an Uber. And the guy shows up, the driver comes in, and I sit in the back of the car. He starts the trip using the Uber app, and then he clicks Navigate and he goes to Google Maps. And I was sitting there. I was like, "Man, I built these two to a certain extent." It was just crazy to think about how two of my worlds came together at that point. I still vividly remember that moment where I felt really proud that I had a little bit of a part to play in both those products.

Lenny (00:13:26):
That is some unbelievable impact. It boggles my mind how many people have been impacted by the work that you've done on the teams that you've been on. Like a billion people in India and everyone in the world using Uber. It's unreal. I would feel very proud myself, watching that experience.

(00:13:41):
Something people may feel when they see a career like yours, they're like, "Man, Manik's just killing it. He's done everything. Everything just is clicking, always winning." I imagine there's been a few times when you've made mistakes or things have been really challenging. What would you say has been one of the more challenging projects or points in your career?

Manik Gupta (00:13:59):
Yeah. No, absolutely. This is really important to talk about as well, because we glamorize successes and we don't talk enough about challenges. I'm really happy that you're asking this. I would give you two times which... I had a lot of learning from both of them, but they were pretty tough times for me. The first time was, I had started my own company at the height of the dotcom boom. We incorporated our company in June '99, and then in March of 2000 we sold our company to another company from Norway. That was the peak of the dotcom boom. Then within a few months right after that, we had the dotcom bust and it was terrible. Terrible. I know we have a pretty bad economy right now. There's a lot of stuff going on. It was really bad, because people around me, my friends, were losing their jobs.

(00:14:52):
Luckily we had some funding. We had secured some of our funding and we had had an acquisition. The parent company was pretty strong in terms of their balance sheet, so we could continue to do it. But things didn't get better, Lenny. 2000 went by, 2001 came in. We kept waiting for things to improve, but they never improved. So we had to pivot. We had to pivot as a company. My co-founders actually left the company at that point. I still wanted to be there, because I really believed that I can keep moving this company forward. Then I was working with the founders of the parent company. We pivoted multiple times, we tried a few things. I even relocated back from Singapore back to India to set up an engineering office so that we can get into a SaaS kind of a model versus an eCommerce company that we were.

(00:15:35):
I tried many things over those two or three years. And remember, this was my first, quote unquote, "job" out of college. I was doing a lot of that and it was a very tough time. But at the same time I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself, I learned a lot about managing ambiguity and just keeping people motivated through a tough time. A lot of that also has to come from keeping yourself motivated, because people can smell fear and pessimism from far. Just like optimism is infectious, so is pessimism. If you're not feeling great as a leader, people will see it. Absolutely. People are not stupid. You have to not fake it. You have to really be motivated to stick it out, and that's what I tried to do at least, and I learned a lot in that. That was one really challenging time for me.

(00:16:21):
Then the second one was, man, during Uber. 2017, 2018 was crazy at Uber. Oh my God. There were just so much going on with leadership changes, with the brand issues we were getting. For me, there were times when I would commute up from my house to the office, and while I'm in the car I will be listening to some news or whatever and I'll hear about things that happened at Uber that day from the news before I got to hear it from within the company. It was that crazy during that time. So again, a lot of chaos, a lot of churn at the company as well. It was something where you just had to keep your head down and just keep staying focused on what the core is.

(00:17:03):
I think that is where, Lenny, the optimism in me in terms of, what am I really doing? Is this a service that really benefits millions of people around the world? Are we creating true change? Those are things that I just have to dig deep into to make sure that I stay grounded on why am I here and why I remain to be here and then at the same time motivate my team. But yeah, those were the two really challenging times that I have encountered, at least in my career.

Lenny (00:17:26):
Those are awesome examples. I imagine a lot of founders are going through a lot of challenging times right now with the market, and imagine these experiences for you were really important and impacted your ability to take on bigger roles and bigger challenges in the future. Is that how you see it? These are important experiences to have over time as a product leader and just leader in general?

Manik Gupta (00:17:46):
Oh, absolutely. Because like I said, you learn a lot about yourself when you go through a situation like this. You learn both things that bother you or bring you down, and things that give you energy. It's sometimes counterintuitive to think about this. When you're going through a bad time, often then people will say, "Well, during a bad time I only learned things which are bad." But you also learn things that are good. Which is, maybe during a bad time you did something and you suddenly felt relieved or energized, and then you look at that and say, "Wait, I should do more of that even during a good time, because can you imagine the compounding power that I would get? Because stuff is good and I'm doing this and I'll feel even better."

(00:18:26):
I learned a lot in terms of my own personal energy, things that get me going, things that really stop me in my tracks. And at the same time, how do you work with a team? How do you motivate them? How do you keep your head down and focus, versus getting distracted? What are some of the decisions you make around your product roadmap?

(00:18:47):
I'll give you an example. During my startup, when we were going through that, in order to motivate the team, one of the best tricks that I came up with, and I learned this from a bunch of other people also, is you just give a team a win. Winning really, really drives a lot of energy. We had a choice to make between launching something which will take six months, versus launching something that we can launch in a very small-ish kind of way, but launch it in a month. And we chose the latter, because when we did that, I remember people were giving high five to each other, people were saying, "Hey, you know what? This is great. We put something in front of customers." We had, I think, 10 customers who used it or something, because we were so soft-scaling that feature. But that didn't really matter. The point was that you get confidence from getting things out, putting it out there, and you feel good about being a builder and being someone who is actually creating a difference. That really grounds the team and focuses the team that there is some real value here.

(00:19:45):
Some of those things I picked up. Both going through that turbulent time, I picked up. And I have used that even in good times to make sure that we keep building good products.

Lenny (00:19:56):
That's such a good tactical tip. Find a win. Keep people motivated. Speaking of wins, coming back to Google Maps and Uber, they're probably two of the most widely used, successful consumer products in the world. I don't know if I can think of other products that are used by more people for this long. Then now at Microsoft you're helping Microsoft get more into consumer on the communications side. I imagine you know a thing or two about building successful consumer apps, and so I want to ask a couple questions along those lines. What are two or three surprising or counterintuitive things that you've learned about building consumer products?

Manik Gupta (00:20:32):
The good news is that there's just... Because of Twitter and a bunch of other channels, including your newsletter by the way, I feel like people are very well informed these days. And I love that.

(00:20:43):
Let me digress for a second and then I'll come back to your question. One thing that I'm observing a lot, Lenny, which I feel very, very happy about, is the quality of learning and insights and frameworks and best practices is so universal at this point. It used to be that you had to be in the Valley or being part of a small group of folks who are doing things at the cutting edge to have those crazy insights about how do you find product market fit and do all that kind of stuff. Today I talk to people from all over the world for various reasons, and it's incredible how fast people pick up all these insights and frameworks and then they apply them to their local setting and so on. I find that to be one of the most wonderful things ever.

(00:21:32):
I think folks like you have obviously played a big part, because you have global subscribers and you share some of the best practices. But just generally, that's actually a really good thing for the world, that people have so much access to clarity of thinking. And the best people are actually putting themselves out there, which is great.

(00:21:47):
In terms of the counterintuitive stuff, I think two things. One is building consumer products is very hard. I think people think it's easy, because each of us is a consumer. We think of ourselves as a good user, we think of our friends as users, we think of our family as users. And we say, "Well, if we just build it for ourselves and for our family and friends..." By the way, a lot of great consumer products started that way, so I'm not saying don't do that. But man, it's hard. It takes a long time to get things right. Because you're essentially trying to get so many things right when you're building a successful consumer product. You have to be able to reach out to a vast, heterogeneous set of users who have different needs, who have different perspectives. The go to market is always very interesting, because you can't force people to use your product. People have to choose you, you don't choose them. That's the part where... How do you drive virality? How do you drive that real love for a consumer product? And it has to create real value.

(00:22:52):
The other thing about time is that, in order for you to find product market fit and then scale from there, you just have to try a lot of different things. There are theoretical playbooks around it, but you got to just get into it. Going back to the point I was making earlier about wins, get some wins and see the results and then iterate from there. I think it's just hard and it takes a lot longer than what people imagine consumer products do. Versus, let's say, enterprise products or products of other nature. That's one counterintuitive thing that at least I've learned.

(00:23:21):
The second one is the global patterns that you see in consumer products in terms of the user interface; the core things that people do or expect. At this point along of that is pretty universal. There's always this debate where people would say, "Well, need to have one product for the U.S., another different type of product for Asia, another different type of product for Africa. I think we are past that point. That's again another counterintuitive thing, where people spend a little too much... I've seen this in many companies. People spend too much time debating that, "Oh, the users in market X are different." Well yes, they're different, but they use the product the same way.

(00:24:02):
That's the part which I think... And I'm not making an argument against localization. Of course you need localization around language, pricing. There are some legal requirements, all of that stuff. Obviously you have to do that, otherwise you don't even have a right to exist in that market. But by and large the patterns are very similar. You look at global products, even like Facebook or Google Search or Maps or Twitter or TikTok and so on, all of them have a similar pattern or similar app for the entire world, and they keep on innovating or localizing at the edges.

(00:24:33):
That's the other counterintuitive thing that people should know about consumer products. Build for the world from day one. Understand that there are going to be some nuances that you'll have to solve as you drive adoption in certain markets, but don't over index on building market specific solutions, because consumers have moved on from that kind of a model. Those are the two, in terms of product building, counterintuitive trends at least I have picked up over the years.

Lenny (00:25:02):

(00:26:04):
Before this chat, we were chatting about this idea of company product fit for bigger companies. How it's an approach to building new products within big companies. Can you just talk about that idea?

Manik Gupta (00:26:17):
Yeah, absolutely. I've been noodling a lot on this, especially since I took on my role at Microsoft as well. And prior to that, even at Google, this was always an interesting discussion. Let's say you are building a new product or leading a new project, if you will, at a larger company. In fact, this also applies to medium-sized companies. I wouldn't say for startups, but medium-sized companies. Usually the narrative in the room when you're discussing this with your team and with your leadership team would be, "Okay, we got to go find product market fit." Absolutely. Yeah. We have to do a bunch of stuff, as we just talked about. Consumer products take time. All of that stuff.

(00:26:57):
But I think there's a question before that question, which is how do you find company product fit? What I define as company product fit. Which is a company essentially is a portfolio of products, and every large company, medium-sized company also has a portfolio. They'll have 10, 20, in some cases hundreds of products in the portfolio. Every company has unique strengths and weaknesses. This is pretty tried, but it's obvious. And I would encourage a lot of folks, when they start embarking on this journey where they're trying to really build out products and so on, is to ask that question. How does that product, assuming it's successful... If it is not successful, it doesn't matter anyway. But assuming it's successful, does it actually serve the right place in a company's product portfolio? Or not? And if it doesn't, don't do it. Why waste time?

(00:27:57):
Oftentimes companies will be like, "I want to do this because some other company is doing it." That is not a good reason. You should only invest in products, or projects for that matter, because you can play to your strengths and you can create some unique consumer, customer value. And by the way, you can do it better than anybody else out there. That's what I mean by company product fit. Take that first step and understand does this even resonate and is it part of the portfolio? Does it make sense?

(00:28:26):
Because if you can answer that question with enough conviction, then your road to the next step on finding product market fit becomes much easier, because you don't have distractions then. Everybody gets it. Everybody gets this is a strategic effort. You have the right sponsorship at the right levels in the company, and you're executing towards it and you're finding it out. Let's say things don't go well. That's okay. People will step in to help. A lot of that will happen, because people innately get it. That this is the right product to go after from a company product fit perspective. That's something that I've been thinking a lot about and also executing as we move forward.

Lenny (00:29:00):
Is there an example of that gone wrong that you can share? Whether it's a company you've worked at or a company you've seen do it badly.

Manik Gupta (00:29:05):
I'll have to think through specific examples, but companies do this all the time, where they do these line extensions. Where they'll say, "Well, we have a lot of traction in a particular segment. Why don't we just go to an adjacent segment? If we just add two more features, suddenly this will be appealing to an adjacent segment." A classic example would be you're doing something for, I don't know, small and medium businesses and you say, "Well, now I just have to add two more features and now I'm going to go up market and I'll get to compete in the enterprise." Or it could be the other way around too, where you have something in the enterprise business and you want to suddenly go down market to SMB.

(00:29:44):
In my view, it's hard. Because again, the capabilities that you need, the thinking that you need, is something you have to really be clear about. This is not to say that it will not fit in the company's portfolio. It's just that when you're making a choice like that, make sure you set it up well to succeed. That's the other part of the equation as well.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Speaking of setting it up to succeed, you also have this idea of a consumer stack concept that I think you've been talking about at Microsoft. Can you talk about what that's all about?

Manik Gupta (00:30:11):
Yeah, sure. One of the things that I'm doing at Microsoft right now is, while I'm working on a lot of the consumer communication products, the other thing that I'm really helping the company think about is how do we get more at scale consumer products built at Microsoft. Part of this is just distilling some of the learnings that I've had over the years. I think there are like five things that I would talk about, which I call the consumer stack, which is essentially a set of capabilities that companies need to have a good chance of success at building a consumer product. Remember, nobody can give a playbook to build a successful consumer product. That does not exist. Because as we were discussing earlier, it's so fickle and so many things have to go right for you to build a successful consumer product. But at least you have a set of capabilities, so you set yourself up the best.

(00:31:01):
The first one I would say is around design-led thinking to delight users. Going back to your days at Airbnb, Lenny, I'm sure this is something that resonates with you. Design for consumer products is such a critical part of how you build the right pull from consumers these days. Poorly designed products have no chance at this point. Your craftsmanship and the design capabilities have to be A plus. And if you don't have that, then you should really invest in that. This is not just about having the best designers. Of course you should. It's just the thinking. It's a attention to detail. It's the attention to how things are pixel to pixel, moving from one screen to another screen and so on. You really have to sweat it out and really be clear in terms of how it's adding value to a consumer. That is, I think, a core capability in these days to build a consumer product. That's number one.

(00:31:54):
Number two is strong focus and prioritization. You can apply strong focus and prioritization to anything in life, but I think it's even more important for consumer products. Because oftentimes people, when they think about solving a problem, they think about coming up with 20 features at the same time, and it's not needed. You don't need 20 features to solve a problem. You just need one or two features which work really well. This whole concept of critical user journeys. How do you make sure that, if you're solving problem X, any feature that you build in the product... Firstly your product should have very few features in the beginning. But even if it has those features, it should be well designed and it should have the focus and prioritization so that you're only getting things for the critical journey so that the user can use it and not get confused. That's the second one.

(00:32:38):
Most PMs totally understand that. That's their job description, to focus and prioritize. But I feel like a lot of times the PMs do get very confused and distracted, because the number of ideas that people have is so large that they want to just throw everything into the product, and that doesn't work. You have to keep a very high bar for focus and prioritization. That's capability number two.

(00:33:00):
Number three is having the right metrics and instrumentation. This talks to the data aspect of the culture, which is, if you don't have the metric with regards to what you're optimizing for at the initial state of the product, middle state of the product, late stage of the product, you're just not going to choose the right things. How will you measure success? How will you convince yourself, your team, and broader stakeholders that this is actually working or not working? Having the right metrics is important, but it's incredible how many times people have the metrics but they don't instrument them. They'll have all these debates, because the product is not instrumented properly. And everybody will talk about the same metric, but they'll have different nuances in terms of, "Oh, what does it really mean? What is a daily active user? Okay, daily means... Okay, I understand it's on a daily basis. What is active?" And there'll be debates about what is active. Pick a definition, instrument it, codify it. No confusion. That's number three.

(00:33:59):
Number four is more on the engineering side, which is how do you get to a very high ship velocity, and the ability to experiment and learn fast. At a broader level, especially during the initial phases, if you're not learning, you are really not doing anything well. You've got to be learning. You've got to be learning good things, bad things, doesn't matter. You've got to be learning. Having the experimentation velocity, having a building culture where engineers are able to check in code, see the results, and then quickly come into another release and stuff like that, I think that's really important for a consumer product.

(00:34:29):
Finally, underpinning all of this is just having strong talent. Assess your talent; your product talent, your design talent, your data talent, your engineering talent, your marketing talent, all these functions. You just have to have a talented pool of people who like to build stuff, and they're the people who understand and have the empathy for consumers.

(00:34:50):
To me, I think these five capabilities... And as a leader, or product leader, or an engineering leader, or anyone who's basically responsible for running products in small company, big company, medium-sized company, it doesn't matter; if you're in the consumer space, my thinking here is that if you look at these five categories and five capabilities, you should really have a report card and say, "Okay. How do I rate these?" If I were to look at my own team, what do I think about design thinking? What do I think about strong focus and prioritization? Are we doing an A job? Are we doing a B job? Are doing a C job or D job? I would argue that if you get to an A job over time, because not everybody will be at A on day one, but if you get that over time, I think you will start seeing results which are very meaningful. That's how I've been thinking about the consumer stack.

Lenny (00:35:34):
Awesome. I was going to ask how you operationalize this. It sounds like it's going to turn into Manik's consumer stack scorecard, and bigger companies can leverage this at their own company and show their manager, "Hey, we're moving really slowly. Maybe this is an area we should focus before we bet big on consumer."

Manik Gupta (00:35:50):
Yeah. I'm trying to operationalize this myself right now in my current job, and I have used some version of this. I mean, this is not something I just came up with. It's something that has been in my mind for a while. I've used it in some shape or form. But during my break, especially before I joined Microsoft, I think this came together for me as something a little bit more tangible that I can use. Then I started applying it, so I think it's been pretty interesting to see.

Lenny (00:36:15):
Awesome. I'm hoping that this proliferates through larger companies and becomes a thing that we can root back to this chat.

(00:36:23):
Shifting a little bit to the CPO role and the VP of product role that you've had at a few companies, in theory this is kind of an end state for a product leader. Every PM, if they stay down the PM career track, they'll become a CPO or VP of product or head of product somewhere. A couple of questions here. One is, do you have a sense of how many PMs actually stay on this track and end up in one of these roles, versus move on to some other role or place?

Manik Gupta (00:36:47):
Yeah. That's a great question. I would say that the percentage for CPO in particular, you having a C title and being a CPO, I think that percentage is still relatively small. This is just my sense. I haven't done the numbers to give you a more accurate picture here, but I think my sense is relatively smaller. Because I think a large part of it depends on how companies are organized. Companies can be organized functionally, companies can be organized through business units, and oftentimes these days it's a mix of both. If you look at any company, they'll have some C level functional executives, but underneath them they'll have GMs. The organization design is just such an evolving field always. And as they say, companies will go one... they'll swing the pendulum one way and they'll say, "Oh, over time it's not working," and then they'll swing the pendulum the other way and then they keep going back and forth. I think the percentage for CPO in particularly in my mind is probably not as big as what people think it is. Like I said, because of the way that companies are organized.

(00:37:50):
I think the interesting thing here is I am just seeing personally, having been a CPO myself and also talking to a lot of people in my network and just observing a bunch of different companies, I think the CPO role is evolving. Or the head of product role is also evolving. I think a lot of it is morphing more into the GM model where you're running not just product management but also perhaps PM and engineering, and design to a certain extent and data science too. You're essentially becoming the overall technical product leader at the company.

(00:38:27):
The reason why I feel that is happening is because it's all about accountability. It's about who has the single threaded leadership model where this person can make all the decisions when it comes to trade offs and running the roadmaps and all of that kind of stuff. It's not ideal, by the way, in all cases. Because what that means is, for somebody to be doing that, that person has to be really, really good at all those other functions too so that everyone who is in their organization respects that. Otherwise people feel like I'm the second class citizen in this model where this person doesn't know anything about, whatever; my function and so on. So it's harder, but I do feel that for optimization around decision making, around having a single threaded leadership and accountability, I feel like that's the direction where the product leadership role itself is going more and more. At least based on my experience.

Lenny (00:39:19):
Is your sense that maybe CPO might fade away as a title and GMs become the common path across companies?

Manik Gupta (00:39:26):
If you were to push me on this, I would say that's probably the direction we will go. I think it's interesting to also think about CTO. If you look at the CTO roles versus SVP of engineering or a VP of engineering, I think it's an interesting debate too, what's happening with CTO roles. If a company is organized purely functionally, I think that's absolutely the right call. But as companies are changing and thinking about how they drive more accountability and more business units and so on, I just feel it probably will become more GM oriented. That does not mean that the VP product is going to go away or the VP engineering is going to go away. I think those roles will still stay. But the C-level title, reporting into the CEO but you're just running that one function; if I look at over time, maybe that role is lot less prevalent than what we have right now.

Lenny (00:40:15):
Do you think that's partly because there's this weird overlap between CPO and CEO, and there's often tension of who's leading the product? Is that something you've seen?

Manik Gupta (00:40:24):
Yeah. I think that's definitely an interesting one as well. I mean, if you think about it, just based on my experience, what does the CPO really do? What is their job description? I think it's useful to think through that. Generally speaking, and again, we can always talk in generalizations because that's how you should think. And every company is unique. But generally you would say the CPO is responsible for driving the product vision for the company, and that product vision cannot be divorced from the company vision. Oftentimes this is actually what also creates conflict within the leadership team, where the product vision is... people are coming up with these grandiose plans. Like, "Oh, we'll do this, we'll do that," but then it's not really grounded in the reality of where the company is. Anyways, it's around product vision and making sure it's coherent with the company vision.

(00:41:09):
Then the second big part of a CPO job is execution of the roadmap on the priorities. People sometimes think that, hey, I get to a C-level position. I don't have to worry about execution. Absolutely not. If you're a CPO in particular, even the CTO and the head of engineering, execution matters a lot. The operational excellence. Because things are so complex. I mean, we are in a situation where a lot of people are working remotely, there are all these different tool sets, there are all these different technologies that are coming up, you have different competitors. Execution is super important. And if people don't understand that that's a big part of their job when they get to the senior level, I think they're mistaken. The execution is another one.

(00:41:50):
The third is, for a CPO, especially for a tech company, because you are really driving the product roadmap, it's a very leveraged job. Meaning you have to really work with all your other peers, whether the marketing person, or the sales person, or the business unit person and so on, and just make sure that you are really even deeply connected in terms of what is really needed, so that your product roadmap is how things are going to actually come to life. It's a very cross-functional, on steroids kind of job in that sense.

(00:42:19):
In terms of the CEO, CPO, I think the important thing again is... And this is actually advice I've given to CEOs of some companies as well, when they first start looking for a VP of product or a CPO. This is almost like a questionnaire that I give them. The first question I ask the CEO is, what do you want to do? That's the most important question. Because a lot of times the CEO has either been the technical founder, or they have been the product founder. They can be a sales founder too. All that is fine. But what do you want to spend your time on? Because if you are going to get a CPO or a VP of product and then still want to own the product roadmap and own the execution, then don't do that. Because what is that person going to do? That's the first question that I tend to clarify between a CEO who's looking for a CPO or VP of product.

(00:43:10):
Then the other thing is really about, are you trying to optimize for process? Are you optimizing for strategy? Are you optimizing for team building and attraction? I think that's a really big one. Sometimes you have to get the right level of leader to attract more talent to the team. Because people say, "Oh, this person is working there. Now I want to go work in their organization." How do you think about engineering and data science and design? How do you think about GM and operations? There are a bunch of all these things in terms of the design that you need to do before you decide whether VP of product, CPO is somebody you want to get and what kind of person you want to get.

(00:43:43):
I think that's where the intersection of the work between this... especially for a tech company, the CEO, CPO have to be... And even the CTO I would throw in the mix. That has to be very clearly articulated, otherwise it creates a lot of confusion. Those are some of the things, at least that I observe from different patterns and different companies that I've worked with and also guided and advised, those are things that always come up.

Lenny (00:44:06):
It's interesting how much similarity there is to that experience as there is to the first PM at a company. It feels like they have to have the same conversations with the founder. What do you want to work on? What am I going to take on? How do we avoid stepping on each other's toes the whole time?

Manik Gupta (00:44:21):
That's actually a... I never thought about it that way, Lenny. I think that's a really good point. You're totally right. Obviously, if you're at a bigger company, then you're looking for a VP of product. Or if you're a super big company, then you're looking for a CPO. But you're right. The first product hire that you make as a founder, you'll pretty much have the same conversations to ensure that there are clear swim lanes and accountability for that group.

Lenny (00:44:39):
Interesting. I want to make sure to ask you, as kind of a big deal leader of product at larger companies, I'm curious, what do you look for in PMs that are looking to get promoted, or just deciding somebody's ready for promotion or ready for more responsibility? What do you look for and what should people focus on if they want to come across as promotion material?

Manik Gupta (00:45:01):
I'm a big fan of looking at both the what and the how. So what did they accomplish and how did they accomplish. Because they're a package. And if you just look at one versus the other, then I think you end up making a mistake. Usually. On the what, I think the what is usually more objective. What I look for... And again, it depends on the level of the person. Don't try to calibrate someone based early in their career. You have to think through that. That they're in learning phase. If they're more senior than you have to of course calibrate them differently. But ultimately, if I were to boil it down on the what, it's really about real demonstrated impact. An ideal example is someone who had a strong product hypothesis, they rallied a bunch of people around them. They may not have come up with the hypothesis. That's fine. Somebody else could have come up with it, it doesn't matter. But they believed in it, they rallied the team behind it, they drove towards it and created impact.

(00:45:58):
The impact not necessarily always has to be positive. It could also be a lot of stuff that we learned, but we learned from it and then we moved on and we did the next rev. By the time we did the next rev, we were smarter about it. Clear demonstrated impact from an end to end product cycle to me is probably one of the better indicators of readiness for someone to take on more. And you basically want to give them more, because now they have a pattern of doing things properly. That's one.

(00:46:23):
On the how, I just love people who are able to create both energy and create clarity. Think of the flip side. PMs who don't create clarity is such a time sink and the teams struggle so much. I'm sure all of us, when we think about back in the day, maybe we were in that position at some point. But we also worked with folks who were always confused and didn't really summarize, or didn't really follow up, or didn't really create that level of clarity in terms of what we need to do and so on, and how broken that felt. People who can create the clarity and then have the energy around them to get things done, I think that's the how in my opinion. Which is really important for determining somebody's career trajectory.

(00:47:11):
Then the last thing I would say is followership. Really important for PMs. Do people want to work with them? Do people at some point, as they go up and become more senior, do people want to work for them? Ultimately people make choices. And if you have a bunch of smart people and they're making smart choices and they're choosing this person to follow or to be with and work with them and reach out to them, and you keep hearing things about, hey, so and so wants to work with this person because this person is amazing; there is a ton of value in that.

(00:47:45):
Those are the three things that, if I were to really boil it down, not looking at a certain level, I think I always look for those attributes.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Those are awesome. So simple and clear and succinct. I like the way that you framed it as followership versus leadership. There's a lot of PM attributes leadership, and there's something really nice about just a way to understand that as how many people are following you and excited to work on the things that you're trying to get them to work on. That's very cool.

(00:48:11):
Along the same lines, when you think about PMs that had an inflection point in their career, do you find that there's anything correlated with something that leads to a large inflection in the progress of someone's career where they all of a sudden started doing incredibly better?

Manik Gupta (00:48:24):
I've gone through a few inflection points myself, and almost always they've happened because something in the organization changed, so I got a shot. There's always that luck factor, going back to the first question that we discussed.

(00:48:37):
But generally speaking, I think the inflection points happen in two places. One is when someone has really successfully changed the dynamic, or the trajectory rather, of a particular product. That's a huge inflection point. That doesn't happen very often, to be fair. But when it happens, you know it. You know, as a leader, this person worked on this and they actually led this change and now we are playing a different game. We are playing a bigger game, we are playing a different game, all of that kind of stuff.

(00:49:16):
In other words, what I'm saying is the inflection point for a career is correlated strongly with the inflection point in the product. If you can connect those, the cause and effect... If there's causality and not just correlation, if there's causality in that, I think that absolutely means that you've got a winner. And you really want to bet on them and you have to give them a lot more to do, because they have the ability to do it. That's one.

(00:49:38):
The second is, oftentimes as people go up in their career, they start managing teams. They become a manager, and then you become a manager of managers, and then you become more senior. I mean, that's the organizational trajectory that happens. One inflection point that I've seen is, when you go from being a manager, a first line manager, to becoming a manager of managers, and if you're able to navigate that with very strong effectiveness, then you know. If you're their manager or if you're their leader you know this person has got their act together. Because managing ICs is so different from managing managers, because then you now need to create a structure. You need to be able to determine how much you delegate. How do you coach? How do coach your managers to do the right thing? If you see somebody making that transition effectively... And you have to give them some time, but if you see that and you know that they're actually doing it, and again, a lot of followership, a lot of other things are happening, good things are happening, then you know they're at that inflection point where they're ready to take on more.

(00:50:41):
Both product inflection in terms of real output and this management prowess inflection in terms of being able to effectively lead going from one step to another, a manager to becoming a manager of managers; I think those are the two places where I feel like, if I see somebody doing well, I know they're ready to put more onto them.

Lenny (00:51:00):
Do you find that second piece is this filter for PMs that do well in this manager manager role and go on to do better and better and then a lot just fall away because they can't handle that?

Manik Gupta (00:51:12):
Yeah, I think so. Maybe I'm a little bit more traditionist on this point. I know there are other schools of thought on this, which I respect. Which is there are a lot of times where people are like, "Well, oftentimes the best PMs are PMs who are IC PMs. They have this crazy, incredible, unbounded energy and they don't want to waste their time on management and whatnot and do that. Because a large part of a PM's job, by the way, is managing by influence. PMs typically don't have large organizations. In fact, one of the most leveraged teams in almost every company... Because you talk about PM manage ratios, PM design ratios, they're never one-ish to one, or one-ish to five, or one-ish to six. Sometimes it' going to be one-ish to 10. At Google it used to be one-ish to eight to one-ish to 10.

(00:51:52):
I personally see that transition... If somebody's making that transition successfully and they're getting good scores out of it and delivering the product and the output of the team is significant, I definitely see that as a good filter criteria for someone whom we can bet on.

Lenny (00:52:06):
Do you find there's common habits or pitfalls PMs make to shoot themselves in the foot in their career, especially early on?

Manik Gupta (00:52:14):
Oh, I see that all the time. There's a few of the things that I have picked up. And by the way, I was doing this too early on and I learned the hard way. The first one I would talk about is you are early in your career and everyone expects you to just manage things and manage the process and all of that. Make sure that trains are running on time and all of that. Which, by the way, is really important for an early in career PM to understand. That that's actually a big part of your job. Let's not over glamorize a PM. A large part of being a PM initially is just basically doing whatever the team needs you to do. But I think one of the pitfalls of that is, if you start putting process over progress, that's a problem.

(00:52:58):
What I mean by that is, you want to introduce process into almost everything that the team does and not be flexible on shipping things out there and all the things that can come in the way of progress. If process is helping progress, great. But if process is hurting progress, you should not be the person saying, "No, no, no, no. We can't do it, because I'm just so married to the process. Because as a PM, that's what I own." I mean, as a PM you don't write code typically, you don't write design specs, you write product specs. Sometimes you feel like, what is the set of attributes that I own? Especially early in career PMs. And you're like, "I own this process. I own this weekly standup meeting, or I own this sprint planning, or whatever." And then you get so married to it that you forget the fact that that's just a means to an end and the end is what you're going to be actually measured on. That's one mistake that I see people making early on.

(00:53:48):
The second one is becoming really too self-centered. It's all about me, not the team. I'm the PM. There's this myth that keeps going around. The PM is the CEO of the product. That's one of the most incorrect things in the world. The PM is an enabler. I said earlier, it's a leverage job. Your job is to really make the team successful. Of course you have to have the product thinking and the roadmap and all of that, but sometimes this can go to their head. Then people become too self-centered and that's a red flag.

(00:54:21):
Then the third one would be just not admitting your mistakes or learning from them. Early in career, the only thing you should optimize for is learning. Sure, you'll make a lot of mistakes. You don't know much yet. You're just coming into this journey and you should be humble and you should be learning and you should be saying, "Oops, I screwed up over here." And that's okay. That's fine. And by the way, if you work in a company where that is not accepted, you should not work in that company. What's the point? You should really be optimizing for learning and learning from other people. And people should be saying, "Yeah, don't worry. It's okay. You made the mistake. Learn from it. Don't make the mistake again. That's fine." But that's the kind of culture you want to choose for yourself.

(00:55:01):
Those are the three pitfalls that I see people get into, especially early on in their career.

Lenny (00:55:05):
You touched on how different companies work in different ways and look for different things in different PMs. And something I wanted to ask you is just to chat a bit about the difference between working at Google versus Uber versus Microsoft as a PM, and also just generally how product is built differently at these companies. It's something I'm trying to do with this podcast as much as possible. Just give an overview of what product is like at different companies. You've worked at three of the biggest, and so I'm curious to hear what you can share around that.

Manik Gupta (00:55:32):
Yeah. It's actually really interesting. I mean, all the three companies are so different. Google, the core DNA of the company was very much engineering. In fact, there used to be a framework which was around technology insights drive innovation. It was always about what is the best tech we can come up with, which is going to indeed drive innovation, and have a longish view so that the market will get there. That was the Google philosophy always. As a PM, your job at Google... It might have changed in the last six, seven years that I've not been there, but at least when I was there from 2008 to 2015, especially working on Google Maps, it was all about how do you take good long-term bets grounded in strong technical insights, and then use the power of Google Search distribution to really get your product out there. That was it.

(00:56:33):
On the Maps team, our innovation was pretty much around crowdsourcing everyone's location signals for traffic. Huge, huge accomplishment. We had the best traffic models in the world. And then being able to do this crazy route optimization for driving directions. Then on top of that, we had the search stack, which came from Google Search anyway. So that you can search for any address, any business and so on.

(00:56:55):
Anyway, as a PM it was partnering very closely with engineers and really amplifying the engineer's ideas and so on. I think at that point also a lot of Google PMs were very technical. Very, very technical. Because that was just part for the course. It was expected that you will be able to at least have engineering discussions. A large part of what I did as a PM at Google, especially initially, was getting into the technical details with my engineers and really geeking out on what we can do. That was the Google model.

(00:57:25):
By the way, one thing I should say about Google before I go to... At Google as a PM, at least all the way up to the time even when I became a director, I never had to think about business models, man. Never. It was fascinating. You were in this weird state where you could just build and have the consumer traction and all of that, but you never thought about P&L, never thought about revenue and so on.

(00:57:48):
Then I landed at Uber, which was very different. Uber was very operations, very business driven, very P&L. In fact, one of the most incredible things that Uber did was they had a dashboard which every employee in the company could look at, and it had last week's revenue, last week's number of trips that we did, and you could slice and dice it and all of that. I think that changed over time as we became a public company and so on. But the point was that it was really in your face all the time. When there were weekly newsletters sent out, it was all about growth, it was all about business, all of that kind of stuff. It was very operational and business, so as a PM over there it was a lot about managing a bunch more stakeholders. The operations teams, the marketing teams, the policy teams and so on. And how do you work with them to deploy your product into each of these markets. Of course then a large chunk of your work was still working with the engineering team. It was different in that sense.

(00:58:47):
I think at Uber the other thing was it was also much more of a real time business. I mean, Google was also real time. Google Maps was real time. Billions of users were using it. But Uber was... every day there was something going on in the market and you had to keep on that hustle in terms of how do you make sure that your staying competitive, your product is working well, there are no outages. All of that kind of stuff was really important.

(00:59:09):
Then finally, on Microsoft... I mean, Microsoft has been around for quite a while. The company went through so many different things and then over the last several years, especially under Satya's leadership, it has done so well. Incredibly well in terms of how the company has changed the culture, the kind of products that they have in the market, the traction they have in the market.

(00:59:29):
I think I would describe Microsoft as both... first and foremost, it's a very strong tech company. The engineers here are incredible. Oh my God. I am so privileged to work with some of the best engineers that I've worked with in my career. At the same time there's a lot of legacy. There are a lot of products that have been around for a really long time, which is good and bad. The good part is that they have seen pretty much every pattern there is to see. In fact, they came up with a lot of those patterns themselves. The bad part sometimes can be that change is hard. How do you convince people that we're going to go down a different path? As a PM, a lot of it is around bringing outside in perspective, bringing clarity of like, "Hey, this is how it has actually worked somewhere else." Bring a specific example. Let's try it out and see how that works.

(01:00:13):
The final thing I would say about it is the company is so grounded in trust. If there's one word that I would say about Microsoft is trust. They really care a lot about customers. Customers trust Microsoft a lot. I've been in some of the customer meetings myself and I can totally hear what customers say. It's all about trust. They expect resilience, they expect the products to work, and they expect that when they have a problem on the surface, that Microsoft will take care of it. They built that over time. A lot of that goes into your mind as a PM when you're working in that company, that a lot of the stuff that we are doing here is to really help our customers.

Lenny (01:00:48):
Going back to your point about company-product fit, these cultures and the way they work just fits perfectly with the thing they end up building. I wonder which one comes first.

Manik Gupta (01:00:57):
It's true. That's a whole nother conversation we can have at some point. I have a lot of thoughts on that. But I'll just echo what you just said, which is that's the reason why it's so important for companies, when they embark on new initiatives, to be really, really thoughtful. Is this the right area for us to get into? Or rather, what are the conditions and the reasons why we are getting into something? We have to be super clear on that. Because if the starting conditions are not right, then you will just trash the team. The team will keep working on something and people will never find the right internal fit. So that's super important.

Lenny (01:01:35):
You worked on Google Maps and Uber, which I imagine you still use often and maybe billions of people use every day. Is there a feature that you wish that you built back when you were on the team, or that you think should be killed, that annoys you about either of those products?

Manik Gupta (01:01:50):
Wow. Okay. This is a super interesting one. I don't know if that's something that I could have built at Google Maps, but one of the things that's interesting is the self-driving technology has just not gotten there fast enough. I feel like the best and brightest actually worked on it and are still working on it and it will get there. I'm a big believer. But of course the timelines have shifted for various reasons, because it is a really hard problem. It's actually really interesting to see what Cruise is doing right now in SF. They have started the pilots and so on, so I'm really happy to see some progress happening. I know Waymo's been doing a bunch of this already.

(01:02:29):
But it would've been amazing. One of the things that we used to talk about all the time at Google on Maps was how would we design a navigation product when people are in self-driving cars? We had some really interesting ideas at that point, but we never got to it. Not because we didn't prioritize it, but the technology isn't there. I still keep a close watch on that and see at what point are we going to get there. It's going to take years, but it is just such a different paradigm. It's like computers talking to computers, algorithms talking to other algorithms. Then there's a human in the mix in terms of serving the human at the end, but it's like the human is not initiating that much. It's just, stuff is happening around it.

(01:03:08):
Anyway, that's one thing that is unfinished business, if you will, in my mind. And hopefully, as the technology comes together, that will happen.

Lenny (01:03:16):
Amazing. Manik, you've been extremely generous with your time. Just two last quick questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out maybe, or learn more about what you're doing? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Manik Gupta (01:03:28):
Yeah. You can find me on Twitter, you can find me on LinkedIn. Those are the two places. I have not been very active on both those recently. I've not been active as a contributor, but I'm very active on those two platforms as a consumer. If you have any questions, if you have any thoughts, would love to hear from you, so please send me a note.

(01:03:47):
In terms of how listeners can be helpful, I just want to learn what's new and what's out there. I've had the privilege of being in these incredible companies. The reason why I'm still doing what I'm doing is because I still want to learn. If there are better patterns out there that you're seeing, particularly around how to build products, would love to know if there are other ways people think about finding product market fit. Because that's such an elusive thing that I just keep thinking a lot about. If you have some techniques, some tips, some best practices that you have learned and it has worked for you, please, please, please reach out to me. I would love to learn that, because it's so important for us to keep having that conversation.

Lenny (01:04:24):
Awesome. It's always such a pleasure chatting. I always learn a ton. And this did not disappoint, so thank you again for being here.

Manik Gupta (01:04:30):
Lenny, thank you so much for asking all these questions and giving me the opportunity to share my learnings over the years. Thank you.

Lenny (01:04:36):
Absolutely my pleasure. That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):
I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce. One of the most legendary launch events in startup history. Just looking back at that, any lessons from what you did right to get people to pay attention?

Marc Benioff (00:09):
I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17):
Your stock is at an all-time high. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow.

Marc Benioff (00:24):
I actually never look at the stock. I find the stock to be very distracting. The stock isn't the goal. That's not why we're doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30):
AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime. When was the moment for you where you started to realize this?

Marc Benioff (00:38):
I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44):
As a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (00:50):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01):
Today, my guest is Marc Benioff. He's co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, which is the second largest B2B SaaS company in the world worth around $350 billion at the time of this recording, making $35 billion a year in revenue, and 25 years later, is still growing like crazy and dominating the market. In our conversation, we talk about leadership, AI, domain names, beginner's mind, marketing, product, sales, the hardest moment in Marc's journey of building Salesforce. Also, what exactly is an agent and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Marc, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Marc Benioff (04:00):
Excited to finally get connected with you and excited to do this podcast with you too.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:04):
I'm even more excited, and I actually want to start with something that I think most people don't know about you, but to me, it's almost like a microcosm of how far ahead you look and almost how... basically, how visionary you are, and that's that you've owned a number of epic domain names. For example, bill.com, you.com-

Marc Benioff (04:26):
You.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:26):
... code.com, appstore.com. First of all, are there others I don't know about?

Marc Benioff (04:28):
There's a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Marc Benioff (04:32):
That all came from... I'll tell you. It's a good story actually because what happened was I was working at Oracle for 10 years from 1986, and 1996 rolled around like it was a snap of the fingers. All of a sudden, I realized, "Whoa, what has just happened to the last decade?" The decade just flew by. It was crazy. It was a big moment for me in my career, and I had a... It was a huge acceleration. I went from being a kid right out of college to working for Larry Ellison. But after 10 years, I was pretty trashed, and so I said to Larry, "Hey, I need to go and take some time off."

(05:13):
So I went to Hawaii and rented a little house on the beach. I had done some angel investing, and it was a cool moment where some of my companies started to go public, including Siebel Systems and others, and Saba Software, and people I had met at Oracle like Tom Siebel and Bobby Yazdani. Then, I was just fascinated at that point with the internet. I had been working on it at Oracle for a couple years, so I started buying a bunch of domain names of companies that I thought companies. They weren't companies yet. Now, they are companies. But ideas that I thought the names would be great companies one day and reflected where I thought things were going. Yeah. It's a long time ago now. It's a really long, long time ago. I think almost 30 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:00):
So one of the domain names you owned was appstore.com, which I know you gifted to Steve Jobs, I read in your book. Is there a story there that you could share because that's an epic domain just to gift?

Marc Benioff (06:09):
It's a great story, but it's really a story about my relationship with Steve Jobs. When I was in college in 1984, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Apple. I wrote the first native assembly language on the Macintosh. It's a crazy thing to be able to say, but it's true that I was writing these example programs for this Macintosh 68000 Development System on these Apple headquarter buildings in Bandley, Bandley Road in Cupertino and started to have a relationship with Steve Jobs in that... Not that I was actually talking to him. I was like this snot-nosed 19-year-old kid, but he's running around the building. We have this refrigerator over here with all these fruit juices. There's a masseuse over here doing shots and massages. There's a motorcycle in the lobby. There's a pirate flag on the roof, and there's Steve Jobs running around, yelling at everybody, and it was freaking cool.

(07:10):
Okay. So you can just imagine like you're like, "Whoa, this is like I'm in a movie." There's a lot of other cool parts of a movie too that were going on, and it started my relationship with him, and then I actually got to know him then as I eventually got to Oracle. Then, eventually, I started Salesforce, and I had this moment at Salesforce. It was, I think, 2000, 2001. I cannot remember exactly what it was, and we were at the opening of one of his movies for Pixar, and we're having dinner. There's a lot of details around the dinner. It'll be a hugely long story if I go forever.

(07:56):
He says to me, "Well, Marc, now, listen to me. You're doing so great. You've got your company, Salesforce. If you need any help, you make sure you call me, okay?" I'm like, "Yes, sir. I will do that." He took out his... He had just introduced the iPod, and he's like, "I got a thousand songs in my pocket here. Look at this, and that, and all that." It's this cool device. I'm like, "That's such a cool screen. Steve." He goes, "Oh, thanks so much." I go, "Steve, you could do movies on there too, not just... or photos. You didn't have to do songs." "No, Marc. I will never do a device like that. Absolutely not."

(08:34):
That's a little insight into his personality that he would never ever exactly say, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to do the movie device that have the photo, the phone, the this." So, anyway. Things were moving along at Salesforce, and so I was like, "I'm stuck, and I need to get through my block, writer's block, entrepreneur's block. I'm going to reach out to him." He's like, "Come down here right away."

(09:03):
So, literally, I got in my car, brought a few of my team with me, and we go down, and he's like, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're blocked. There's three things you need to do right now." I'm like, "Okay. What are they?" He go, "Your company, it better get 10 times larger than it is now in 24 months or it's over." "Oh, okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir." "Number two, you better sign a huge customer for this Salesforce automation product like Avon. They're a great salesforce." The CEO of Avon was on his board at the time, so that was on his mind. "And one last thing I'm going to tell you you must do." I'm like, "Yes, sir. What is it?" "You better go build an application economy." "An application economy?" "Yes." "What does that mean?" "I don't know, but you're going to go figure it out."

(09:55):
It was like meeting with your guru and getting a Zencon or something where you're... Now, you have a puzzle I have to solve. I literally went away, and I had all the notes from the meeting. I went through it over and over again. Then, finally, I'm like, "I think he wants me to build an app store." At that moment, I went to the domain registry, and I bought appstore.com. Then, I started working on it at Salesforce so that we would have the ability with our platform to build apps, and then sell them, and that you could do all these things.

(10:34):
So I did all that and launched AppExchange in 2005 or 2006. We didn't call it App Store because when we tested the App Store name in focus groups, customers are like, "This is not an app store. This is an app exchange. We're all going to exchange apps and capabilities with each other." Anyway, it rolled out, iPhone rolled out, and then he basically said to me one day, "Hey, come down and see me." This is maybe a year after iPhone. I'm like, "I'll be right down."

(11:08):
I get down there, and I have some team members with me. They'd heard this story before, et cetera, and then we're sitting there like this in the Apple Auditorium. It's not like in a hotel or anything. I remember it very clearly like it was yesterday. He said, "I brought you all down here today." It's very good theatrical performance. I could never do what he does. It's incredible. He's got the thing, and then he says, "And I'm here to reveal to you the App Store." All of our people go, "Huh." They're doing break breath, and they're all like... go white because they're like, "Oh, Marc has been talking about App Store for years. How could Steve even..."

(11:51):
Then, at the end of it... It's all over. Everyone leaves the auditorium. They're all going out to play with the App Store and all these things. I walked down. He's sitting down there by himself working on something. He's in the corner of the stage. I go, "Hey, Steve. Can I talk to you for a second?" He goes, "Of course." Very generous with me. Very kind with me. I go, "Steve, I'm going to give you a gift." "Wow, but Marc, what are you are going to give me?" "Steve, I'm going to give you something you don't have, but maybe you'll need, which is the appstore.com URL, appstore.com, and the trademark for App Store because after that meeting we had six years ago, I ended up trademarking these things and buying this URL." He's like, "Oh, it's very nice, but you know this App Store thing isn't going to be very big. Whatever, but thank you very much." That was the story of App Store. It's amazing. It was a very amazing relationship that I had with him. Very grateful to have that relationship and dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.

Lenny Rachitsky (12:59):
There's one thread that I love about everything you shared. Here is how generosity was at the center of so much of this, him helping you, you helping him, just wanting to help each other.

Marc Benioff (13:08):
He is a very generous person, and I'll tell you that he never turned down anything that I asked him to do. I have so many stories, but one story was I was thinking about buying this house, and I wasn't sure should I buy this house, Should I not buy this house, whatever, and so he went... He said, "I'll go look at it for you." So he went, he is looking at this house, and then he calls me, and he goes, "Well, I don't know if you should do this or that, but this might be good. Maybe it is good. Maybe it is a good idea."

(13:41):
Then, I'm emailing with him after that, and he's very sick, and it's all very sad. Then, he sends me an email, and the last email he sent to me was he said... I said, "Wow. Well, this has worked out better than I thought." He goes, "Marc, everything has worked out so much better than we could have ever imagined." It was just a beautiful thought and incredibly sad all at the same moment, and that was my last correspondence with him.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:14):
I feel like we could do Steve Jobs stories all day.

Marc Benioff (14:16):
Yeah. Oh, no, I have hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:19):
Yes, you can.

Marc Benioff (14:20):
I have a lot of Steve Jobs stories, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (14:21):
Oh, man.

Marc Benioff (14:22):
Yeah. Anyway, those are a couple of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:24):
By the way, I also love that he had B2B SaaS advice here like, "You need a big customer. You need to hire ACVs, build the marketplace."

Marc Benioff (14:30):
Oh, he hated those. He hated SaaS, and he hated that I was doing enterprise software.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:31):
Yeah, he did.

Marc Benioff (14:35):
He's trying to talk me out of being an enterprise software executive. He's like, "Now, Marc, what are you going to do? You're going to go home and tell your kids that you're working on enterprise software? Who do you sell to, CIOs? Have you had met them? How can you be doing this? I can't imagine a more horrible career." I'm like, "I love it, Steve." "No, Marc, you cannot love this. This is not great." It was really a funny thing. He really disliked that, but yet, he was incredibly supportive of me. He would call me all the time. It was really amazing, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:06):
Yeah. It feels like a place he was wrong in the end here, which is cool, cool to know. I want to go in a different direction.

Marc Benioff (15:12):
He was rarely wrong, by the way, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:14):
He was rarely wrong with B2B SaaS. $350 billion of value. Who would've known it existed? Speaking of that, so I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce and when you launched Salesforce. It's crazy to think back to that when basically, you were trying to convince people the future of software was not desktop software, it was going to be in the cloud, it was SaaS. You had all these end of software logos. You had mascots walking around with this no software thing. You hired fake protesters at... I think it was Siebel's conference. It was very hard.

Marc Benioff (15:44):
I think you read one of my books, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:46):
I know the history of a lot of these things.

Marc Benioff (15:48):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:49):
It's one of the most legendary launch events in startup history, so I've heard of it many times at this point.

Marc Benioff (15:54):
It was a crazy moment. I mean, Siebel, who was really the enterprise software company doing CRM, was doing a user conference. I was looking for an opportunity to launch our product, so we hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco, and San Francisco is very woke, so people expect a good protest. So we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, "The end of software is near," and all kinds of other... "No software," and all these things. We had a lot of funny things on signs. We were running a protest outside of Siebel that they were in the software business, but we were like, "Oh, no, we've got to get out of software. We've got to create the end of software." So we have picketers outside of the streets.

(16:50):
Anyway, he comes out himself out of the building and really gets super upset. Right then, we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters. So now he thinks that it's a media thing. He calls the police. He got very upset. He's a great guy. By the way, I love Tom Siebel. I think he's also one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. He's just fuming, and he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't exactly know it's us, and we're just having the best time. That night, we had our huge launch event at one of the top theaters in San Francisco. We hired a great band, and it was really... We just had so much fun. It was just a really great time. That was all happened. I remember very well. It was February 22nd of 2001 or 2000, 2000, February 22nd, 2000.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:06):
I love this. I haven't heard that interview, the reporter part of that story before.

Marc Benioff (18:10):
It was crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:12):
I love it, and it sounds frivolous potentially, but I think the genius of this that I want to touch on is-

Marc Benioff (18:18):
"Frivolous" is a good word. It probably was frivolous.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:21):
So what I imagine is you're trying to get people to even know Salesforce exists, to differentiate, to get the name out, and I feel like that's something a lot of founders struggle with. They don't really know how to get their name out, how to get people to pay attention. Just looking back at that success, I guess, just any lessons from what you did right to get the word "Salesforce" out to get people to pay attention at all to what you were doing?

Marc Benioff (18:42):
Well, it's a noisy world, Lenny, and you can see that. You can get on Twitter. It's like... I mean, there's a lot of noise, and how do you break through? We have that challenge today. We're introducing a huge new product called Agentforce. I've only been working on it for a couple months now. I introduced it at our Dreamforce Conference, and that was one way to break through, which was I took our conference and said, "It's just going to be about Agentforce." I'm trying to think about, "What are all the things I need to do to get my company 100% on Agentforce, my customers, everyone?" because I know I have a window of opportunity here.

(19:25):
We're first, we're ahead. We have hundreds of customers on this now. We're on it, which is amazing. We've moved our whole help infrastructure to Agentforce. We're seeing incredible results. We've cut our human escalation from our support infrastructure down by 50%. We're resolving 83% of all of our inquiries robotically. It's incredible. So, now, how do I get that message out? How do I do it globally? How do I find my KNMS moment where I can come up with something that's viral and exciting?

(20:04):
I'm trying lots of different things. I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, "We'll cut ads for you." They have not been together in an ad ever, and they haven't done anything together since True Detective. They're friends of mine. Again, very generous people to agree to do this. We've shot three ads so far. I put them out on Twitter to get feedback from folks. Is this a good idea?

(20:35):
I am running this help.salesforce.com to show what we can do with it. Is that a good idea? I'm training all my salespeople in how to sell it. Is that a good idea? I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against. Is that a good idea? Should I be marketing and positioning against them?

(20:58):
I'm trying lots of things, and what I'm trying to do, Lenny, is what I recommend to all entrepreneurs. The message is really in the medium here, which is that I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy. I don't know actually which one of those things is going to be the most important thing in launching this product, so I'm trying a lot of things with that old expression. I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. Then, once I find that thing, I will then grow that as my strategy, and that is what I'm trying to do.

(21:33):
I'm even expanding my distribution organization. I'm trying to hire an additional one to 2,000 account executives just to focus on Agentforce. So I'm trying to do everything I can to get that light switch to go on where I can show customers this is an incredible opportunity to lower your cost, to make things better, and to show that for the first time, we can have digital labor, that Salesforce isn't just managing your data, but we're a digital labor provider. So this is that moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (22:03):
There's so much there that I love, this idea of trying a bunch of things, looking for the tactic that becomes your strategy. It feels like also there's this focus of just go all in and focus on this one thing, and then try a bunch of different ways for this one thing that you're focused on to win. There's also an element of... I just had Seth Godin on the podcast, and one of his big lessons is be remarkable. Create something people remark about. So this celeb-oriented ad that you're working on, I think, is a really good example of that.

Marc Benioff (22:31):
Well, that is a key thought though that he's saying, which is you got to find it, but finding that is the hard part, so you got to be like... One of my friends is Chris Rock, the comedian. So what he'll do is he just doesn't go out and do a Netflix special with all of his jokes. He's out there testing his jokes in clubs and doing all kinds of crazy things. I won't go through all the crazy stuff he does to test his jokes, but by the time it gets to the big Netflix special, he knows what works and what doesn't work. So that is something that we all have to do as entrepreneurs. We need to be testing lots of things. We need a lot of experimentation, and we can't be too arrogant.

(23:15):
I think another thing that's extremely important is... I have a pretty deep meditation practice for three, four decades which is we have to be cultivating our beginner's mind. We have to use our mindfulness in a way to clear everything out and then get back to, "What is my beginner's mind?" In the beginner's mind, I have every possibility, but in the expert's mind, I have few, and in some cases, maybe none. So I've been doing this a long time. I've been writing software since I'm 15. I'm now 60. That's 45 years. I don't want to have an expert's mind. I want to have a beginner's mind, and how do I have that beginner's mind? Because those ideas will come at me if I can go, "What could work?" rather than saying, "Oh, I know what is going to work," or, "This is the one thing that is going to definitely work," or, "We have to do this."

(24:10):
As soon as you start using words like that, you know that you're going to completely implode and fail. You have to say, "Here, we have to do all these things." Like in my company right now, we just did this all-hands call. I was like, "There's six things I really want to get done," but one thing is I didn't get everybody focused on Agentforce and really watch the energy. Number two is I need to find more fuel in the company to fuel this idea because this is clearly a breakthrough product, so how do I get everyone focused on it? Number three, where I think it's really important, we need more distribution capability. We don't sell through franchises. We're not selling through dealers, resellers. We sell direct, so I know I need more account executives.

(24:56):
Number four is I need to be telling lots of customer stories. So, number one, customer zero, me, and number two is I need to tell you all the stories. Like, you can see the story of Disney. I'm doing a huge amount of AI work for them and Agentforce work. Let me tell you the story about Disney. I need to tell you that story, and then we have this whole ecosystem of people around the company called Trailblazers, millions of them, who know our platform. They all have to become agentblazers.

(25:23):
The last thing is I just shipped the product into all 135,000 Salesforce customers. So it's their nascent, and they need to flick it on. I need to motivate them to turn it on. These are the six things I'm thinking about all the time. So it's not just one thing. I'm trying to figure out what it is, and I need a beginner's mind to assess how do I move forward, how do I evolve, how do I inspire, how do I motivate, how do I energize.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:51):

(26:57):
I love this idea of beginner's mind. I imagine it's very difficult to operationalize, especially for a company at 25 years old at this point. Obviously, you meditate. You put a lot of effort and focus into building this. It's hard to do that within a company. Is there anything you do with meetings, with leadership, with the way you operate that spreads this way of thinking within the org?

Marc Benioff (27:18):
Well, Salesforce is now the second largest software company in the world, but also the second largest software company in Japan, and that's a country where I put a lot of time and energy into. I love going there. I love going to Kyoto. When I go to Kyoto, I like to go to some of these amazing Zen temples. By the way, that's one of the things that Steve Jobs love to do, and he used to go to these great sushi restaurants. There's a great one in Kyoto named Sushiiwa. If you go in there, you'll see he's signed something for them. It says, "All good things. Steve Jobs." I said, "What did he do over here?" He would go to this great sushi restaurant, and then he would go to Ryōan-ji, the Rock Garden Temple. Incredible metaphysical temple.

(28:04):
I've gone there. I've gone there for decades. I've brought a lot of friends of mine there. Yeah. You got to clear your mind and let it come in. You got to receive it. You need to listen. I remember I even brought Neil Young there, the musician. He's one of my favorite people in the world, and obviously, I love his music. His soundtrack is the soundtrack of my entire life. We were sitting there, and he was so deep in meditation, and then he started walking around. The temple was closing, and then he was in the zone, and I didn't want to bother him, but I'm like, "You know, I think we got to go."

(28:38):
Anyway, it turned out he had written a whole album while we were there in his head, and he was basically transcribing it all. This incredible creative process. Look, we're all writing an album in our head. What album are you writing? What music are you writing? How are you getting into that zone yourself? You want to be a great entrepreneur. You want to be a great CEO. You got to clear your mind, and you got to be ready to write that music.

(29:06):
That music could be your business plan, your product plan, your product launch plan like we're talking about for my Agentforce product. That's what we're all trying to do, and I use a place like Kyoto as a place to do that also because geography is important. Where you are matters. I know you're in Marin, so Marin County. Maybe you can go out to the top of Mount Tam. Maybe you go to Spirit Rock with Jack Kornfield and go clear your mind there, but you got to find the place to do that and create the location. It may not be in the office. It may be somewhere else.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:41):
By the way, you have the most amazing friends list. All these folks you mentioned, I've met.

Marc Benioff (29:41):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:49):
I don't know how long this goes. [inaudible 00:29:49].

Marc Benioff (29:48):
They are cool. I am lucky that I've met a lot of cool people. Yeah. I don't know how I got so lucky to meet some of these people.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:53):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about... Every month or so, I hear about a startup, I do a bunch of angel investing, that's trying to basically disrupt Salesforce, come after Salesforce. They bash your... don't kill me for saying this, your user experience. They're like, "Oh, so complicated. It's been around three to five years."

Marc Benioff (30:11):
We are too complicated. I agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:12):
Okay. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow. We're recording this today, and your stock is at an all-time high basically even now.

Marc Benioff (30:25):
Wow, I didn't even know that.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:27):
Roughly.

Marc Benioff (30:29):
I actually never look at the stock.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (30:31):
I find the stock to be very distracting, and I encourage my employees also don't look at the stock because the stock is just a reflection. Money isn't the goal, right? The stock isn't the goal. It's coming at the end of the journey. It's like that's not why we're doing this. The journey is the reward. That's also something Steve Jobs would say all the time. Another bow to Steve Jobs here. I think that this is really important, and I look at myself as a startup.

(31:05):
I am a startup CEO. I'm a startup entrepreneur. I'm still at the beginning of Salesforce. No matter what I'm doing at Salesforce, whether I'm the CEO, I'm sometimes the chair of the board. Like, last week, we had a board meeting. Sometimes I'm a product manager. This is a startup, and we're a 25-year-old, 75,000-person, $38 billion, $300 something billion market cap startup, but we're a startup nonetheless. We have some great products, but we are just starting. As an example, Lenny, we are just starting the digital labor industry, and we have a product called Agentforce, and we are just starting. We are just at the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:47):
I want to bounce around a little bit, but let's talk about Agentforce. I know this is, as you've said, the thing you're most focused on right now. It's a big bet you all are taking. When people hear this word "agent," I think a lot of people are embarrassed to even ask like, "What does that even look like? What is an agent beyond what LLMs are today?" Is there an example you could give of something you've seen that maybe blew your mind of what an agent can do?

Marc Benioff (32:09):
Yeah. I saw it in the movies. I saw it in Minority Report, which was a movie that was co-written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz. Tom Cruise runs into the Gap store, and all of a sudden, it says, "Hey. Hey, Tom. Have you thought about this new shirt? Look at these jeans. You bought this last time. Now, you could try this. You could try that. What about this? What about that?" It knew his history. It understood him. It knew what was going on. This is 20 years ago. This whole store changes digitally to reflect his interest, his ideas, and it's starting to talk to him and work with him.

(32:51):
That is an agent. It isn't just the agent that we saw in the Matrix, Mr. Smith, or whatever it is. It's someone that's working with you, someone. That's an interesting, for you, slip. It's something that is working with you. It could be your piece of software in your phone. It could be a robot that's going to be in your home. It could be your car that knows you, understands your preferences, has an institutional memory of you, and now is helping to advise you.

(33:22):
I'll give you an example that I'm going to... I go into UCSF all the time. I'm actually just getting through an Achilles rupture right now, so I've had a lot of interactions, and the hospital... or you're getting your healthcare, getting your labs done, getting your physical done, getting your scans done, whatever it is. There's always these pre-operative and post-operative or pre-procedure and post-procedure things, and you're getting these phone calls. Every time I get a phone call, I'm like, "Ugh, that probably just cost them a hundred bucks, and we probably could do that a lot cheaper and a lot easier with an agent."

(33:58):
Then, when I talk to my doctors and nurses at UCSF, they're all burnt out post-pandemic because they're scheduling pajama time to go through all their digital messages at night. It's like a lot of this could be done a lot easier with agents and AI, and we're going to make their lives a lot better, a lot easier, simpler. Some of those things that they're doing, they don't need to talk to me about what my cholesterol number is because I got my labs, and the cholesterol number is this number or that number. A lot of this can be done with technology, and then save the parts that are important for them like when I come to see them or I want to have a real, deeper, more empathetic conversation face-to-face with a deeply experienced doctor. That's a whole another opportunity for me.

(34:45):
That is an agent or the agent is like... Here's an example. I had a CT scan, and you have to drink this contrast, and then all of a sudden, the... drink it, but they give it to you through an IV, and then they're taking better pictures. But then, you have to drink water to flush the contrast out of your body. Do you think anyone called me and said, "Hey, did you drink the water?" No, nobody calls me to drink the water. You have to remember. You're on your own in healthcare in the US. So the agent is going to call you and say, "Hey, did you drink the water? Did you take your meds? Do you need to have a repeat lab? Do you need to go see your doctor again?" So the agent is going to be there by your side. So that's an healthcare example. There's a lot of examples that we can probably have.

Lenny Rachitsky (35:25):
There's just a story in The New York Times which isn't about agents specifically. It was about comparing ChatGPT to a doctor where they tested a doctor's ability to diagnose versus a ChatGPT directly or a doctor plus ChatGPT. By far, the best was just ChatGPT, removing the doctor from the equation.

Marc Benioff (35:43):
Yeah. They wrote up a clinical study where they actually did look at, in a semi-peer-reviewed way, that ChatGPT, in many cases, was giving more accurate diagnoses than a doctor because the doctor had a more bias coming in working with the patient. So that's super interesting and I think something that we should probably all look at that study and think about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (36:09):
Speaking of The New York Times, there's actually this quote I found. You did this op-ed talking about AI. So the quote is, "Throughout my career in Silicon Valley, I've witnessed numerous waves of innovation, but none compared to the profound impact of AI. AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime." When was the moment for you where you started to realize this where it's like, "Oh shit, this is not just another cool toy?"

Marc Benioff (36:33):
Well, I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI, and it's happened over a series of decades. But for those of us who grew up with these movies like WarGames and Minority Report or Her or... across the board or read some of these books. One of my favorite books on AI is Ghost Fleet. You think about, "Where are we going with AI? Where are we going with AI?" With Salesforce, I think about our journey, and I've been waiting for this to happen and trying to bring us along, especially in the last decade with the development of our Einstein platform, and now the development of our Agentforce platform.

(37:18):
This week, at Salesforce, we'll probably do about 2 trillion AI transactions. With our total now, Einstein and Agentforce platforms, we're definitely the largest provider of enterprise AI transactions in the world as far as I could tell, and I keep thinking, "Wow, this is going to get more and more intense." One step was we had to automate all these customer touch points. So like wearing my Disney fanboy shirt here, we run the Disney Store and the Disney Guides, and there's Disney Real Estate, and there's the DisneyQuest call center, and there's... Every aspect of Disney. When you're a customer, you're interfacing with Salesforce.

(38:00):
So that's what we've loved doing, automating all these customer touch points: sales, service, marketing, analytics, Slack, integrating it all with MuleSoft. That's what we do, and then aggregating it all into a big database where we call it data cloud, and then federating that data cloud to other data sources. So that's the two steps we've been doing, automate the customer touch points, aggregate the data, and then step three is the agentic platform on top of that.

(38:29):
When you think about what's happening now that you can go to help.salesforce.com and have your issues resolved with that on the agentic layer, that's amazing. Then, the fourth layer that will come will be the robotic drone layer where those robots and drones will then feed off of the platform and all of these capabilities. That vision of the future is something that we've all had in the industry for years. It's not my magic vision. This is a vision that's been around. It's been the fundamentals of computer science that we would move from having... We'd go from data to automation, and that is what we're all driving, and we're driving that industry. We're going lower cost, easier to use, and more automated constantly. That's powerful. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:21):
You mentioned Einstein briefly. I'll also mention my dog is named Einstein, and I got Einstein swag once with the socks, and I love them, so. Also, that's also an example of you bought einstein.com very early.

Marc Benioff (39:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:34):
That was another domain name that you owned.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Well, I just thought Einstein would be a great name to talk about artificial intelligence, and it really has been. There. You can see him behind me right on my shelf, on my bookshelf. I keep him back there. You see Einstein? I think they were [inaudible 00:39:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (39:36):
My view is blocked.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Oh, I'll go grab him.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:52):
Totally. Okay. Let's check it out.

Marc Benioff (39:54):
There he is. Ugh.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:55):
Show and tell Segment in the podcast.

Marc Benioff (39:55):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:59):
Oh, cute.

Marc Benioff (40:00):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:00):
That's a big old Einstein.

Marc Benioff (40:02):
That's a key part of our vision for Salesforce, our Einstein platform was everything we're doing. We wouldn't get to Agentforce without getting to good old Einstein here.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:12):
Very cute. As you talk about all this, I imagine many people are thinking, "Oh shit, we're not going to have as many people working. What are we going to do with our jobs? AI as agents." I know anything you say could be taken way out of context and just like, "Marc Benioff says everyone is not working," but I guess just... I know you've said you're not going to be hiring as many engineers next year. I guess anything there to help people understand how the workforce will change in the future?

Marc Benioff (40:35):
Well, I can tell you about my own company and what I'm telling my own employees, which is that, yeah, we're going to have to rebalance some of our workforce because you can see it in the numbers I just gave you which is we need less support engineers because we have a robotic support layer with Agentforce. So that is very real, and we all need to adapt. At the same time, I'm hiring a lot more account executives and folks to grow the company. So I just encouraged everybody on the all-hands call to think about that.

(41:06):
Then, I just gave you the idea of healthcare. The interesting thing about healthcare though is that a lot of the jobs that I think that are going to get created just... we don't have people for, and I think there's a lot of things that we need help with in the world that we don't have people for. So I think a lot of these jobs will not necessarily get replaced, and I think that... I have a home in a small town, and in this small town... It's very much a blue-collar town. Folks are still working in the restaurants, driving trucks, working in the supermarket, and working on their homes, building, construction, gardening.

(41:56):
Look, it's going to be a long time before, I think, jobs in the small town where I have a home will ever get impacted. But in the large town where I have a home, San Francisco, well, then I just gave you an example where I think that jobs will get impacted. So it'll be a tale of two cities, literally, and I think you will see different impacts in different places.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:21):
So what I'm hearing there is support people trending down, account executive sales trending up?

Marc Benioff (42:27):
Right now, that is Salesforce in a nutshell.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:31):
That touches on something I wanted to touch on also which is that you're... A lot of founders today are very product-minded, very product-oriented founders, and they want to build product-first companies, grow product-led, all these things. Salesforce, I think, very publicly, is very sales-led, very marketing-led, not product-led. Obviously, product is a core part of it, and it all works together, and all these things. But I guess just any advice for founders that are very product-oriented and maybe are hesitant to lean into sales, into cust-

Marc Benioff (42:57):
Yeah. I would say we're not sales-led. Well, I think let's just use Agentforce as an example, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (43:01):
Mm.

Marc Benioff (43:01):
So we're running the year, we're running this year. This is our fiscal year 25. Okay? It ends in the end of January next year. Lenny, this is the year of data cloud. This was not supposed to be the year of Agentforce. So it's the year of data cloud. I just gave you the pitch. We've automated all the customer touch points. Now, we're adding the data cloud to all of our customer implementations. We have 135,000 customers. We've implemented data cloud into all of them. They all need to turn it on. Our teams need to show our customers how to build data cloud and how it's going to help our customers have a better data structure. I almost combined "beta" and "data" together. So they need a better data structure, data architectures, data cultures.

(43:51):
Then, we had our breakthrough, and I can tell you the story where all of a sudden, I'm like, "Wow, this agent technology is happening much faster than I thought it was going to, and we are going to market now." By the time we get to Dreamforce, we are going to take this incredible technology. We accelerated it radically because we bought this company called Airkit, which is one of our Ohana... It's a great story.

(44:18):
Great entrepreneur have this company, fantastic company called RelateIQ that we bought many years ago, about 10 years ago, stayed with us for many years, like six or seven years, wanted to leave, and we said, "Great." We gave them the investment to leave, invested in the company through Salesforce Ventures, built this amazing platform, and then we said, "Now, we want to buy it back." Then, he came back about a year ago, and then it just accelerated the agent vision, and then we delivered Agentforce production code at the end of October. So, all of a sudden, now, we are releasing this product.

(44:56):
I think it's very important, if you're an entrepreneur, to realize it's not just about the product. It's not just about sales. It's not just about marketing. It's not just about accounting. It's not just about your investors. It's not just about your employees. It's not just about your stakeholders. It's about everything, so you better be ready to be an orchestra leader. You can't just be playing the clarinet.

(45:20):
I think that's what you're getting to, which is that there's entrepreneurs who are like, "I'm just going to play the clarinet." For those, I don't think they're going to go as far as they could go. You want to be playing the whole symphony, and you want to get everyone running. That symphony is sales, service, marketing, product. Every part of your shareholders, your stakeholders, your customers. You have to be constantly playing the whole symphony, and you have to have a big mind to think about, "Whoa, I have a lot of stakeholders in my company, not just one stakeholder." It's not just about product and technology. If you're going to narrowcast yourself, you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everybody else as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (46:02):
Speaking of big mind and beginner's mind, we have a recurring segment on this podcast that I call Fail Corner. Where it comes from is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of, "Everything is going great. We're killing it. I've had all these successes," and people get discouraged because they hear just people only succeeding when they often fail. So I try to ask guests to share a story, and let me ask you this. Is there a story you could share when it was a big struggle for you when you're struggling when something went super wrong that you worked through and learned something from?

Marc Benioff (46:35):
Sure. Well, I'll just give this example. About two years ago, we went through this huge transformation in our company, and there were a lot of crazy things that were happening, but it was a little bit like we're all on this Airplane, and everything is going really well. Then, something seems to be going really wrong, and we look up front, and the two pilots seemed to be missing. Then, the one guy with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and then we're all like, "Whoa, what are we going to do?" We had to do some really crazy and somewhat destructive things at the moment to basically get the regeneration of the company.

(47:12):
One of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company, and I didn't want to do it. I mean, it's the last thing I want to do as an entrepreneur, which is to adjust our headcount, but we were coming out of the pandemic, and we had just hired too many people.

(47:33):
Now, it turned out that a lot of companies in Silicon Valley all did that same maneuver during the pandemic. Things were so robust in the pandemic that we were overhiring. By the time the pandemic was over, we had too many people. I mean, what did I know? It was my first pandemic. All of a sudden, my next pandemic, I'll know that there's an economic cycle associated with it and an inflation cycle too.

(47:58):
So I learned a lot in the pandemic, and now, we're here. Now, all of a sudden, we're architecting two years ago this layoff. Then, when we did the layoff, then I'm trying to overcommunicate. I'm having all employee meetings. It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me. It's like, "Oh, boy." If I had a thick skin, it got a lot thicker during that moment because it's never going to go well no matter what, and it didn't go well but we got through it to the point where you're giving me these accolades, wonderful, on this podcast about where we are today financially and from a structural standpoint or now from product innovation standpoint, but that's not where we were two years ago.

(48:51):
It was clear we had to go through a financial transformation, which included an adjustment of our head count, and we had to go through a technology, and a product, and an innovation transformation. Those two things were going to require us to do a number of things, and they were going to be painful. So we all had to go through some of that pain to get the gain that we have now, and that was not easy.

(49:17):
I was in shock that I was going through this two years ago because I had already been running the company for 23 years. Things were going pretty well. Yes, there were a lot of failures during that period. I just didn't expect another massive issue to hit me. But guess what? There're constantly massive issues coming at you, and there's more coming, and that's the nature.

(49:39):
My friend, Michael Bell, is probably the best entrepreneur I know. He says, "There is no linear success." So what that means is that stock chart that you just referred to, there's no up-and-to-the-right perfect chart where it's just one line. I don't care who you are. Apple doesn't have one. No one has one. Okay? There's going to be changes. It could be economic changes. It could be societal changes. It could be the pandemic. There's no up-and-to-the-right. If you think it's only going to be about up and to the right, you're in the wrong business or you have the wrong life. Right? Hey, the monastic life is maybe more for you where you're just out living in that more of that steady state. Right? But if you want more variation where it's not steady state, the entrepreneurial life is a rock-and-roll roller coaster, and you get ready because it's going to be pounding you all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (50:33):
One of these people that you described that jumped out of the airplane speaking on the roller coaster ride is your co-CEO, Bret Taylor. What's interesting to me is he's also all-in on agents, and what it makes me think about is there's this meme of what did Ilya see when he left and tried to kick out Sam Altman. I'm curious just like what did you guys see about agents being the future that you're both so committed to this? So interesting.

Marc Benioff (50:54):
Well, I just think that this idea that agents are one of the most important things that we're all going to work on, and I think everyone is going to go to agents. Look, I just heard about Google today has Agentspace. At first, I was like, "Well, I guess they like the Agentforce name." I love Sundar. He's one of my favorite people in the world. We heard Microsoft now has agents. I read Oracle has agents now. SAP has agents. Everybody's got agents, and good. That's what we want. We don't want to be the only one.

(51:30):
If you're the only one and no one else is working on it, you've got a problem, actually. So you don't want to be the only one. You want to be in a market. You don't want to be one company offering a solution and the only one. You want to be in a competitive market where people are competing with you, and you're selling against somebody else, and you're getting better, and you're moving forward. It's like the automobile industry. One of my favorite people is Akio Toyoda. Toyoda-san was now the Chairman of Toyota, was the CEO of Toyota. His grandfather started Toyota. He says, "Better, better, better. Never best." It's the Japanese motto of Kaizen.

(52:10):
So we talked about Japanese Shoshin, which means beginner's mind. Now, we're learning another Japanese word here, Kaizen. Kaizen is continuous improvement, and you need to be doing continuous improvement. With where we are right now with agents, every software industry is going to move to agents. We have to just like every software industry... Well, at least in CRM or automating customer touchpoints, data and managing data, and building that data infrastructure, agents. It's all related. We're all moving in the same direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (52:47):
I'm just thinking as a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (52:54):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. That is the mindset you want. You want that mindset. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing." In some ways, you have to be saying, "I can't wait for the next failure. I can't wait for the next success. I can't wait for the next innovation." Oh, well, that's innovation overall, right?

(53:18):
See, we're in an industry where technology is constantly getting lower cost, easier to use, and more automated. So if you're doing for two and a half decades, or four decades, or four and a half decades now that I've been doing it... When I started in this industry, I started on a computer called the TRS-80 Model I with 4K of RAM. I was doing a podcast recently, and they're like, "Well, who did you sell your first piece of software to?" I said, "Well, I sold it to CLOAD Magazine in Goleta, California and-

Lenny Rachitsky (53:54):
For $75.

Marc Benioff (53:54):
For $75, and they said, "Thank you for..." and then they said, "Oh, that's great, and did you send them the disk?" I'm like, "No, no. There was no disk. CLOAD standard for Cassette Load in BASIC. That was the command in BASIC, C-L-O-A-D, Cassette Load, CLOAD. That was the command. So that was the name of their magazine, and then you would get the cassette every month with five or six things that they had bought from people like me." I mean, they didn't know they were buying it from a 15-year-old kid in high school in Burlingame High School California. But I had written the How to Juggle thing, and they bought it for $75. They sent me the one-page agreement, and I signed it. Then, I told my parents, and they're like, "What? Huh? You're doing what? Oh, okay. That's nice, honey. Great job."

(54:45):
So they didn't understand. Nobody knew. It was crazy. It was like 1979 or 1978, so nobody knew I was selling software. I was in high school. It was just a moment in time, but I need to have that mindset all the way along which is, "What is the next great thing? What is the next great success? What is the next great failure?" You're growing. You're evolving. You're learning from that. That's what you want. You want to have that growth mindset. Right? You want to embrace that. Does it make sense what I said?

Lenny Rachitsky (55:21):
Absolutely.

Marc Benioff (55:22):
I jumped on that one little thought. "Oh, gee, yeah. I've got this now under control, but now I've got agents, so now, what am I going to..." It's like, "No, that's what you want." By the way, I want what's after that too, and what's after that, and what's after that. That's what's really exciting about the future. It's coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (55:43):
Why?

Marc Benioff (55:43):
I want to be... One of our customers said this, and people think I said it. It wasn't me. I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there. That's what I think is... By the way, that's what I think Elon Musk does so well. He is like... I don't know all the crazy things he's doing to see the future. He's clearly doing some unusual things, but then he's like, "Yeah, we're going to have robots in the future, and brain machine interfaces, and driving electric cars. All of these things are going to be happening in the future, and I'm going to have 10 companies that are going to do all of them." Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:23):
He's not only thinking about it, he's doing them each.

Marc Benioff (56:26):
Amazing,

Lenny Rachitsky (56:27):
Amazing.

Marc Benioff (56:27):
No one like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:29):
Yeah.

Marc Benioff (56:29):
Never seen anything like it. I don't understand how it is even possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:34):
Same. Marc, I know you have to run. This was incredible. I think this is a beautiful place to end it.

Marc Benioff (56:40):
Oh, Lenny, you're so much fun. I've been looking forward to being on your podcast and talk about entrepreneurship, and thanks for everything you're doing for the industry and for entrepreneurs everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:49):
Same, Marc Benioff.

Marc Benioff (56:50):
We're all so grateful to you. Goodbye now, and welcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:53):
I feel the same. Thank you. Bye. Bye, everyone.

# AI and product management | Marily Nika (Meta, Google)

## Transcript

Marily Nika (00:00):
There is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI." Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high-level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it.

Lenny (00:28):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Marily Nika. Marily teaches the most popular course on Maven on AI and product management. She's currently product lead at Meta focusing on Metaverse, avatars and identity. Prior to Meta, she was at Google for over eight years working on Google Glass, computer vision and machine learning around speech recognition. In our conversation, we touch on what PMs should be paying attention to when it comes to what's happening in AI. We talk about a bunch of resources that'll help you get started in the world of AI. How AI tools available today can already help you do your job better as a PM.

(01:12):
We also get relatively technical into what exactly is a model, how are models trained, all kinds of fun stuff like that. Enjoy this conversation with Marily Nika after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Lenny (01:53):
This episode is brought to you by EPPO. EPPO is a next-generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on EPPO to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth in stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPPO does all that and more, delivering results quickly and avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(02:41):
EPO lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPPO supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out EPPO at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(03:06):
Marilee, welcome to the podcast.

Marily Nika (03:08):
Thank you. Hello, thank you for having me.

Lenny (03:10):
It's very much my pleasure. We've interacted a little bit on Twitter. We've never actually talked before just right now. I've seen your course just all over the place, your course on AI and PM. And so I just thought it'd be really fun to have you on and help us all understand what the hell is happening in AI and especially AI and product. So thanks again for being here.

Marily Nika (03:33):
Yes, thank you. I'm really excited.

Lenny (03:36):
I would love your help as a former full-time PM/everyone listening that is a current PM, to help us understand what is going on with AI and product tech in general and tools in general. Move really fast, if you're trying to pay attention to what's happening, it's really hard to stay up to date on where things are going and it feels especially hard in AI.

(03:57):
It feels like there's just something coming out every day. And so I have a bunch of questions along these lines. The first is just like what media do you pay attention to stay on top of what's happening and what's new and what's interesting in the world of AI and machine learning?

Marily Nika (04:11):
As you know very well, subscribing to newsletters is something that's really impactful. And of course, I subscribe to your newsletter, but I am a big, big, big fan of the download by MIT Ecology Review or Atelier. And they're not necessarily AI-centric, but what I'm advocating for and what I'm telling people is that in the future everything will be AI by default. So even if you have something that's technology focused, you'll see a lot of AI starting to get sprinkled in there.

Lenny (04:40):
I want to follow up on what you just said there, but maybe we'll save it a little bit. Maybe going in a different direction first, what do you think is overhyped in the space of AI right now? What do you think is under hyped and undervalued?

Marily Nika (04:52):
I would like to discuss strategy between, which is both under hyped and over hyped at the same time. I was reading this article this morning where there are writers complaining and they're very, very fearful and they think, "Oh, writing online is going to die. Everything we've studying for is going to be replaced. They're going to take our jobs and so on." And I'm just like, "No, no, no. Charging PT and technology is enhancing our work. It's enhancing us. It does not steal from us." So that's what comes across right now. And there are other things that are under hype, but obviously ChatGPT is amazing. I'm using it day to day, but there are other things AI can do in an amazing manner.

(05:34):
I was reading a research article the other day that said that AI can now detect place. So lie detection, whether I is for security reasons or at work or anything like that is now possible. So I encourage people to go to these newsletters and go to these online blogs, 10 prints and so on, and just read what's happening. It's not all about chat reading, there's more, there's more about AI, but you should read a lot.

Lenny (05:58):
You mentioned that you use ChatGPT in your work life. Talk about that. What are you actually using it for?

Marily Nika (06:04):
Even when I'm at work and I am trying to come up with a nice mission statement, when we're PMs will come up with mission statements, it's just crucial part and it's where the core begins. You want to get people excited, you want to get people inspired. There is nothing I can write that's going to be as good as what ChatGPT looks like. So what I do is I literally go to ChatGPT and I say rewrite this mission statement from me and even the first try produces something which is fantastic, so that.

(06:34):
Number two, it helps me create user segments in a fantastic way. It will think of user segments that your mind wouldn't even go there, it just wouldn't go there. And it will provide the motivations, it will provide the pinpoints and you just come up with ideas as you read it. And then the last thing that it does is it provides ideas for you whether AI enhanced. So I just use a day-to-day, even [inaudible 00:07:00] day-to-day workflow, but I'm not making it do my job for me, I'm asking it after I have already had a mission in my head and what it is I want to do.

Lenny (07:10):
So is the way you're approaching it is you just put in, come up with a better mission statement then and then you give it your version of the mission statement?

Marily Nika (07:18):
Exactly.

Lenny (07:19):
Interesting. And you're saying that that comes up with a better mission statement than the one you had?

Marily Nika (07:25):
It's better because the mission statement is going to be read by all disciplines. It's not just going to be read by PMs that already have a lot of context and understand. It's going to be read by leadership, by junior people, by stakeholders, by other departments, by competitors. And you needed to be on Orient ending the words that are meant to be understood by everyone. Even a kid could understand and they would get inspired by you as well.

Lenny (07:49):
And then you also said he use it for personas. How do you actually frame that prompt with ChatGPT?

Marily Nika (07:55):
Let's say you're working for a specific product area and you know want to create some fitness band, so you would say something like, who would be interested in the fitness band that doesn't have a screen? And it will provide a bulleted list all of people like, hey, young professionals are that they're interested but don't have enough time. People that do not want to charge their wearables every day. Then the list goes on. It's just fantastic.

Lenny (08:24):
You were talking about how you think the future of AI is, it's the default and is what you mean there that it's basically baked into every product we use and it helps the user do better things, it helps the product work better. Is that what you mean or is it something else?

Marily Nika (08:39):
I believe that ballpark managers will be AI product managers in the future. And this is because we see all products needing to have a personalized experience, a recommender system that is actually good. I mean you cannot watch to Netflix, you cannot even watch a movie without needing that. After you watch White Lotus or Stranger Things, you will want something similar to watch. You're not going to want a romantic thing to be suggested or recommended to you.

(09:06):
Also, automation is another thing. We need to keep improving on society. We need to keep making technological advancements. You're not going to be able to do that if you don't have an AI centric view in every sector that you're working on.

Lenny (09:20):
When you say that every PM will be an AI PM is your thinking that you'll be using AI tools in your job as a PM or that you'll be building AI into everything you're building with? How do you think about that?

Marily Nika (09:35):
I think it's that you will need to get comfortable with having a partner that's a research scientist and you will need to understand that these people can produce a smart model. They'll be able to do some automation, some personalization, some recommendations on. In a lot of people, truly uncomfortable, a lot of people don't know how to approach the researchers. A lot of people don't like the uncertainty that research has. A lot of PMs are very, very used to, "Okay, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch." Whereas when you're working with research, it's more like we're going to try this and then in a year if it doesn't work out we're going to shut the written down and repeated completing [inaudible 00:10:17]. So I feel that if people get more used to uncertainty and research, things are going to be good in the end for them.

Lenny (10:28):
I thought you were comparing ChatGPT as a researcher you're working with, but you're actually saying people will have PhD researchers on their teams helping them build models into their product to make their product better. Is that what you're saying?

Marily Nika (10:43):
Correct. This is exactly what I'm-

Lenny (10:45):
Interesting.

Marily Nika (10:47):
And from a product perspective I can imagine like three bubbles in my head. So you want to find the intersection both something that's desirable by users, something that is going to be a viable business and something that is going to be feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective. And then when you have that, it's just going to be a capacity product for desktop launch that you can run with. So yeah, whenever I say researcher, research scientist that can produce an AI machine learning model.

Lenny (11:15):
Wow. Didn't think about how every cross-functional team might end up with a research scientist. Interesting, interesting. For PMs who are curious about learning how to do this stuff, what are a couple things that PMs today who have no experience with AI, what can they do to start learning how to build AI tooling into their products, understand what the hell's happening in the space of AI?

Marily Nika (11:40):
This is a good question and I guess the message I want to pass is you shouldn't be overwhelmed by these technologies if you don't have a technical background because you can learn these things and as a PM you'll never need to actually train or code. Also, even if you want to train, there are no code approaches for training models. But to answer the question, if you're working on any product, you can always sprinkle in a smarter feature. So you can make it more secure, you can personalize it, you can enhance it with fraud detection, you can make it more ethical. If it's healthcare, you can make it faster, you can make it more accurate. If it's shopping, you can create better accommodations. Basically anything where you can get data behind the behavior with users can be improved with AI.

(12:30):
So I guess it's all about changing the mindset of PMs. Taking a step back and just thinking about, okay, I have all this data that's just lying and sitting around what is it that I can do with it? I've been meeting PMs that said, "Oh, we're not collecting any data, we're [inaudible 00:12:46] dashboard." So even that is a huge first step towards AI. And then just start thinking about it, where you could deal, get a data science intern and just see what they are going to do. There's just so much people can do.

Lenny (13:00):
So say you want to start investing in some sort of model, some sort of AI within your team, you're saying maybe hire data scientists who can help you start to build something that you can start integrating. Is that your advice on the first step of once you start, you want to start getting serious about building some sort of AI component.

Marily Nika (13:19):
There is something called the shiny object trap and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI". Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it. And there's a definition I like giving. I usually say that the generalist PM helps their team and their company build and ship the right product. But the AI PM helps their team or company solve the right problem. So if you want to get into AI PM figure out what the problem is that you will get a data scientist to create a model for solving, but there needs to be a problem, there needs to be audience, there needs to be a user and a pin going for it.

Lenny (14:11):
What are signs that AI may not be a good approach to solving a problem? You said that, and this happened on a lot of my teams, oh we're going to build a really cool model, it's going to do something really smart in this case and it often ended up being a very low ROI investment and took six months to a year before you even knew what the hell what was happening. Do you have any thoughts on signs that maybe this isn't a place you should be putting a lot of time into AI versus this is definitely an opportunity. Yes, we should do this, invest a lot of time into this.

Marily Nika (14:42):
Don't do it for your MVP. It makes zero sense. Do not waste time of data scientists that can train models with using powerful machines that are going take weeks to train. This is because if you have an MVP and you just want to get buy-in for an idea or feature that may use AI in the future, take it, create a little figma prototype and just show it some users, just fake what the AI is going to be doing. So a lot of young early stage entrepreneurs reach out to me and they say, "Oh, should train this model to do this and that because we want to prove that there is a market." "No, do not use AI. You should use AI where you think you already have some data or data from an adjacent product that you feel you can leverage for your own product to create something that's meaningful, recommendation automation, what we talking about. But not for an MVP. Please people, this is my advice.

Lenny (15:46):
How much data do you think you need for AI ML to have a chance to contribute? You have a heuristic of if you have anything less than this, it's not going to work at all.

Marily Nika (15:59):
This is a good question and it honestly depends on what I'm what I'm trying to do. If you're trying to classify, if the photo is a category dog, obviously even if you have, I don't know like 15, 20 labeled photos, what's going to work. But if you want to create voice recognizers or complicated NLP applications, you're going to need thousands of [inaudible 00:16:19] of data. And this what's making this not be easy? AI systems are not easy to develop. There is a life cycle of a machine learning project and after scoping you need to figure out, "Oh god, how much data do we need? Where do I find this data as well, how much data?" Sometimes I've seen people synthesizing their own fake data just so that they can have something to train with and test their models. But the exact amount is hard to be defined, especially from a [inaudible 00:16:50]. I'm sure data scientists have a different opinion.

Lenny (16:53):
Yeah, my guess is most startups are going to have nowhere near enough data to build their own model and make it something really interesting. So do you have a thought on when it makes sense to try to build your own model, try to train your own GPT type thing versus use something that's already out there like say GPT or aJourney or all those guys.

Marily Nika (17:17):
If you are a big tech company and you're offering a service that is going to do speech or permission or then it's going to have their own tragedy, you want to use more data and more diverse data to train and retain and train because if you don't then your quality is going to be the same as every other companies. There are agencies that are selling data, packages of data, that are ready so you can get them and train your models. But the question is if everyone takes that exact dataset, then the quality that every single company is producing is going to be the exact same. So you do want to diversify, you do want to collect your own data. And I guess a good question from my prem perspective is when is the quality of your product good enough to lunch?

(18:08):
And that is a really interesting point because it's totally your responsibility as a PM to decide, "Okay, the recognition of whether this folder is a category dog is good enough for the users, it's like 70% accurate, 80% accurate, where is the bar, where do we launch?" And that's why I'm like the AI PM role is so cool because you have problems like that to solve that no one else was tackled before. So it's all on you.

Lenny (18:34):
We've thrown out these words model and we talk about training models. Do you have a good succinct explanation for what a model is for folks that aren't that technical and then just the general idea of training a model. What is a simple way to think of, here is what a model is.

Marily Nika (18:52):
So I have a three-year-old girl and I'm teaching hear about life and everything. So I was recently teaching her about the animals and you explain things to her once or twice, what the mammals is or rhino and so on. But you will end up training your kids brain by repeating the same information again. So you will say, "Hey, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like." And once you've done this enough times, then your kid will see an animal on the street and they'll be able to recognize and say, "Oh yeah, that's like rhino what we're talking about." This is exactly what a model is. The model is like a kid's brain. It has the ability to take an input, which means it has the ability to take an image and say, "Oh I recognize what this is. That looks like a rhino. But I'm 70% sure about this." So you will output the probability as well of the certainty.

Lenny (19:51):
And you said image, but it could be text for say in ChatGPT. In the future I imagine video there's also voice like whisper. That's an awesome explanation. Basically it's like trying to recreate the human brain is a nice way of thinking about it. And then training a model, can you talk about what that means?

Marily Nika (20:08):
The problems of training the model for example is providing a lot of images that are legal and say, "Hey, here's what card looks like, here's what it all looks like," and we're talking about thousands and thousands of data sets for this. And once you do this, there's a process where the model is just processing this information and it's learning, it's finding patterns through it and the patterns are not in the form of, oh if this is gray then this means this. No, it just learns in the smart brain how to identify specific things that we don't even understand. And then it's able to output the probability of whether photo is going to contain the cutter and top.

Lenny (20:49):
Just conceptually what is the output of the training? Is it code that is auto-generated with these decision trees and weights and things like that? Is it a database of weight? Just conceptually what is the output of a training that becomes a model? What's the simplest way to think about that?

Marily Nika (21:05):
So it's what it speaks. Speech is a great example. For example, I'm talking to a device which is like a home system and I say, "Hey, what is the weather like today?" This is going to take my folies and audio and it's going to process it and the output is going to be a transcription. So it's literally going to be text that corresponds to what I sent to it.

Lenny (21:24):
Thinking about the stuff you've worked on at Google, at Meta, anywhere else you've worked on, side projects even, what are some of the cooler applications of AI machine learning that you've worked on, contributed to, or even seen that you can talk about? I imagine there's a lot of sensitive stuff too going on.

Marily Nika (21:40):
One thing I want to talk about is the team I used to work for, Google, which was then the RVR team and they were working on an air glass and actually they had a video on last year's Google IO. They were able to have the Google glass on someone that spoke one language and then this other person was sat in front of them that spoke a different language and the glass will take as an input that audio that came from that other person and it will transcribe it, it will translate it and show it on the screen for that person in their language. So we're talking about the ability for this devices to unlock the borders of communication and that is not science fiction. This is what amazing and mind-blowing, there's no science fiction anymore. These things are real, the technology is here, it's just a matter of connecting the pieces to the puzzle in order to see them coming to life. So I think that one was one of the most impactful things I've ever seen.

Lenny (22:46):
I remember that demo and it was pretty incredible. Okay, so thinking a little more broadly, do you think ChatGPT or just say GPT four or GPT five, GPT six, do you think at some point this will replace product managers? Something I see on Twitter a lot. People are like, "Oh my god, product managements done. This thing made my product requirements document for me." Or you talked about how it makes your mission statement better. Do you think there's a place where PMs aren't necessary anymore?

Marily Nika (23:13):
Oh, absolutely not. As I said, it makes everything better. If anything it's going to free out time for me to do other things that are less tedious. For example, I am running so many projects and they only their peer [inaudible 00:23:27] and the peer [inaudible 00:23:28] have all these areas that are common across all of them. If I had a system that can actually write the continuous stuff for me so that I can focus on more strategic side of things, that would be incredible. It will make us smarter. If [inaudible 00:23:42], you will unlock new areas of product management that we haven't realized that, but are there.

Lenny (23:48):
Are there areas, do you think with your kind of vision of all PMs will be AI PMs, are there areas that you think PMs should invest more skill-wise or areas they should less focus on invest because say some machine learning model is going to do that for them.

Marily Nika (24:04):
I'd like to see people being less overwhelmed, less intimidated, less afraid to start learning how to code, how to train a little model on their own. This is because even if ChatGPT or this no code applications may be able to do this for us, it gives you a different approach, a different mindset, a different if you want confidence to know how things work. And here's a silly example, I was learning how to play the piano when I was young and when my teacher came in I was like, "Oh, I want to learn how to play this cool song." There were some songs that I really liked. And she said, "No, you need to start with a classical music," and I just hated it all the time. And I said, "Why do I have to do this?" Because she said, "If you learn the fundamentals and how you know where things started and the beginning of music, it's going to help you along the way to create music on your own if you want to." And she was right. I just loved it.

(25:00):
So it's the same with coding. I encourage people to just take an online course, understand more, get your hands dirty, pair up with someone else that's in the same boat as you because this is going to give you the skillset to understand how that tool that's going to help you in your day-to-day was even created in the first place instead of blindfoldedly distrusted to do your job.

Lenny (25:23):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, bias and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management including a continuous employee-centric approach. So employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

(26:21):
For someone that actually wants to do that and learn to code, which I love that advice, do you have any resources, places that you point people to for learning to code, getting started down that path?

Marily Nika (26:31):
It depends on what type of learner you are. There are some people that learn offline, so just go to Coursera, there are so many courses. There is an amazing one actually introduction to AI by Stanford that they're going to encourage people to take a look at. But I know that a lot of people don't like, don't have the time, don't have the discipline to actually take time off or after work, after they put their kids to sleep to just do it. So if you enjoy learning with others, if you enjoying being part of a team, if you enjoy going through a journey together, then I recommend these resources. So there is something called Career Foundry, which is a fantastic on coding school, General Assembly and then Coding Dojo.

(27:13):
I was actually give a talk, Ages of God Coding Dojo [inaudible 00:27:17] by Python, and all it takes is just a few weeks of your time and passion and just for you to roll up your sleeves and just realize that this is not intimidating and realize the benefits you can get by learning.

Lenny (27:31):
Awesome, thanks for sharing those. We'll include links in the show notes. Going back to a PM trying to become better in AI. If you think about a PM that's early in their career and wants to become a very strong AI PM. I know you have a whole course about this, which we can talk about now or later, whatever is easier, what should that PM be doing? We talked a bit about learn to code, maybe start playing with tools. What else do you suggest PMs that want to become really strong AI PMs do now and invest in?

Marily Nika (28:02):
So I do have a course that's coming up on February 6th on [inaudible 00:28:06], which is for current and aspiring product managers that want to build AI products. But I also have offline recordings. I have the same course on an offline basis on my website. I'd be happy to talk to you here, you already chat to me about this. What I feel people should understand is what it takes to manage an AI product. Of course people are very familiar with the stages of product development in general, but AI product development is different. As I mentioned before, sometimes you're actually managing the problem and not the product and you're trying to secure out if there is a problem that makes sense to be answered by a smart solution.

(28:45):
So it's a very interesting and more complicated process than regular product management. So number one, figure out how it differs from general product management. Number two, if you're already at the company that is actually having AR researchers and AI research scientists, I encourage people to just maybe talk to them and shadow them and spend an hour of their week just talking to them and experiencing what they're doing. This is going to open your mind, this is going to give you so much context as to what it is and the endless potential that you can identify there.

Lenny (29:22):
Awesome. And is there anything else you want to share from your course that you think might be interesting to folks?

Marily Nika (29:30):
So we talked about why it's awesome to be an AI PM, but I do want to call out that there are a few challenges that people need to be aware of. Number one, and I kind of mentioned it before, is the uncertainty. You may have been working on all of these incredible research and ideas in hypothesis, but then when you actually train the model, the results you may be getting may not be optimal, may not be answering the questions or the hypothesis that you actually had in mind. So that's number one. You need to be able to encourage the teams throughout this process because you're like the captain of the ship, you need to be the one that's cheerleading the team, making sure everyone keeps going.

(30:10):
Number two, you are going to have to [inaudible 00:30:15]. You are going to have to change the action in managing this from a leadership perspective can be tricky and it can be challenging.

(30:22):
Number three, we talked about data, but getting good data is hard. You may need to be creative, figure out ways for data collection that you never thought you'll do. You may get on the street and ask for people to actually contribute data for what it is you're doing. You need to be able to and willing to do everything. And the last thing is from a career trajectory, usually product managers get ahead the more they launch. But if you're in a research or if you're not going to launch as often, so you need to make sure to clarify with the hiring managers early on, "Hey, what does progress mean? How am I going to get a sense in a research work which is different than what I've been doing so far." So it's challenging but I always encourage people to flex different muscles and this is the zero to one muscle. The other thing is this crucial when it comes to product management.

Lenny (31:15):
This actually is a great segue to a question I definitely wanted to ask, which is around getting buy-in for investment at a company for ML. So there's sometimes all this energy for a zero to one, let's just try something, sometimes not, so maybe there's a two part question here. Do you have any advice on just getting buy-in for we want to try something with ML. It's going to take us six months to figure out if it's worth the effort, but we think there's something here. And then sometimes there's a lot of energy initially and then you get some win, like your search ranking's smarter and it's great.

(31:48):
But then maintaining that, having all these really expensive people working and just tweaking this model and continuing to make it smarter and a little more efficient, often it's hard to continue to get buy-in for that sort of team. Do you have any advice on initial buy-in, let's try something here, and then down the road just keeping a team going, trying to make this thing smarter and smarter.

Marily Nika (32:09):
People should know that there is an excellent source of inspiration and something that could kind of de-risk things, which is adjacent products. Maybe the company has already launched the product that has been successful, those AI firsts. And whenever I try to convince leadership about something that I want to do that's a big bet, I always use examples and I'm like, "Hey, this seemed crazy at the time, here's how they work. What I'm proposing is very similar to this crazy thing. And then I propose a little contingency plan, like hey, if that doesn't work out, here's the rollback plan, here's the maximum impact it will have done in a negative way, which is not going to be too much. And you kind of take it all on [inaudible 00:32:55].

(32:55):
And it's interesting because the more you work on this specific company, the more trust you get. And if the culture is such, then failing is going to be welcome. So a lot companies that welcome pain because you can just go ahead and do this sort of thing.

Lenny (33:09):
Do tell me if I'm wrong, but I feel like most investments in ML are not successes and often not great uses of time. I'm curious if that changes with more tooling and more public models that people can plug into without having to build their own. I wonder if it becomes like, "Oh okay look we're put in three weeks, we'll get something really useful."

Marily Nika (33:27):
Exactly. And also the other thing, and I wanted to add on the question you asked before about hey how do you keep updated about new niche tech? We shouldn't underestimate academia and research blogs and there's a website called Archive where you can see new papers come up, because this is where... ChatGPT and [inaudible 00:33:49] used to be there for a long time, there was a lot of information on this sort thing. But it's now recent where we see that research scientists and research orgs are not as siloed as they used to be. So the more companies invest on staffing, this layer between productionizing and research, academic research, the more PMs you're going to add there, then the more you're going to see this bridge creating goods, products, [inaudible 00:34:20]. So sometimes you have amazing ideas by research scientists but you need a PM to take it and actually figure out ways to also monetize it.

(34:28):
That's the other thing, if you're a PM you need to come up with ways to actually be able to monetize and ChatGPT is now free for everyone. But I don't know if you saw, there was a signup forum that was coming around saying, "Hey, would you pay for this? What would be the minimum you pay? What would the maximum you pay? What would you like to see if you paid?" So having PMs breached the tap is crucial for companies to be able to take the research and actually come up with meaningful use cases for users.

Lenny (34:56):
I think they actually started charging the other day. I think it's like $40, $42 a month to start using it. I think people have been talking about on Twitter, I don't know if that's live yet. And then you talked about research papers, when I think that, I always think of Tyler Cohen, he has this awesome blog marginal revolution and he is really good at sharing insights from research papers that he's reading. So that's another place for folks to check out. He's just this really smart dude. He's really excited about AI and GPT in general and so he shares a lot of really interesting insights about it all. Segueing a little bit to your course, I have a couple questions about it. One is can you just talk about the broad framework of your course? How long is it, what do you learn, what are the workshops broadly? And then I have a couple follow up questions.

Marily Nika (35:39):
My course is three week long. It's meant for people that are either aspiring or current PMs that want to understand how to sprinkle in AI solutions or they wanted a full-time AI course. Week one is more about introduction, what the product development lifecycle is for regular products and how it differs for AIPN specifically. And then we talk about idea creation. How on earth do you come up with ideas? And I love what Steve Job said where he used to say, "Well, users don't know what they want until you show it to them." And that's exactly the mindset I want to invite two people and say, "Hey, people don't know how on earth you use AI." People will never have imagined ChatGPT can be what it is.

(36:26):
And then we take that and we dive deep and we talk about how on the earth do you productionize something like this? What are the different partners you're working with? What is a research scientist and how on the earth do you collaborate and how do you partner with them? How do you convince them what you have in mind for their precious research to be converted into a product? How on earth do you convince them to trust you and how do you influence them? And then at the end we're talking about how you actually will be able to pave your pathway PM all the way from interviewing for this role, from what resumes look like, and doing some mock interviews because the more you practice the better it is.

Lenny (37:03):
How many workshops are there through the course?

Marily Nika (37:05):
Nine workshops.

Lenny (37:06):
Nine workshops. Of the nine workshops, which of them are you finding is the most exciting, game-changing for someone, most interesting?

Marily Nika (37:15):
So throughout the duration of all these workshops, people have homework and they actually take home an exercise where they need to create and develop their own AI product end to end, and they can pair up with each other. By the way, there was this two students pair up and actually where I would raise funding, which is mind blowing to me, which is really great.

Lenny (37:15):
That's awesome.

Marily Nika (37:35):
But to continue, the most exciting part is when everyone at the great end are actually presenting their work and they're actually asking questions and getting feedback and they're just really excited and proud for what they created.

Lenny (37:48):
That's a good reminder of a lot of the learning that you do is just doing it, not just reading about it and following Twitter. Can you share any examples of stuff people built after the course?

Marily Nika (37:57):
Someone was able to actually, and I kid you not, create a little model that was able to take us an input x-rays that they found online and was able to tell us what was wrong if something was wrong with that patient. And it's just crazy to think that you can do that within three weeks. Obviously it was just by photos we were able to crawl online for x-rays. But the concept is there that you can build something like that, you can create it. And to take it a bit further, they wanted to create a lower recommender system and say, "Hey, we think this is what's wrong with you, here are the steps you should follow." Obviously we're not trying to play doctors or to pretend that or medical in any way, but being able to see that actually functioning is just, it's very impactful.

Lenny (38:48):
That's amazing. Do they already know how to code, do this team that built this thing?

Marily Nika (38:51):
They did not, but part of the course is to teach people the basics that you are going to need, prove it PM lens. And there are some no click tools as I mentioned that are going to allow you to drive and drop and train these models and input photos in it and be able to do it.

Lenny (39:07):
Can you mention those tools again because that is really interesting and it's just like a peek at your course, but if someone wanted to start building something like this, what are some of these tools they could check out?

Marily Nika (39:16):
One of the tools I would like to recommend to people is actually Auto ML. This is offered by World of Cloud and essentially it allows you to train high quality custom machine learning models, which minimal effort, you don't need to be able to code anything like that. You need to have a lot of photos and images that you have already corrected but it's not going to do the collection for you. And a great application I had to seen, there is actually a YouTube video about this. There was this company that actually had a lot of winter banks and what they did is in order to maintain these, they will actually have people manually have huge ladders and go take a look and see if everything was okay. So eventually they just [inaudible 00:39:59] drones and they had these drones fly on all of these machines and take photos of everything. And then they downloaded all these photos and they uploaded on Auto ML and they were able to see which ones needed maintenance and which did not.

(40:12):
And I think they reduced time from three weeks of work to a few hours of knowing which needed maintenance and just be able to send people there. So it's this type of thing that you can do on your own by applying this sort of tools.

Lenny (40:25):
Saying that tool is called Auto ML?

Marily Nika (40:28):
Yes, Auto ML.

Lenny (40:28):
Amazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Coming back to your course and maybe just a couple more questions. Can you just talk about what it takes to build a course like the course you built, how much time did it take you? How much work did it take? Anything that you want to share.

Marily Nika (40:43):
It treated creating like course like a product. This is what I did is, I came up with some hypothesis as to who the audience was and as to what they were looking to get out of it. And I started reaching out to people and I started saying, "Hey, first of all, would you like to learn from me? Second of all, what would you like to learn? What are the specific questions that you would need answered?" Because these are people that are working, people [inaudible 00:41:09] that have families. In order to take a break from all that you need to provide something to them that is meaningful. And there were quite a few activations. In the beginning I was focusing the course more for software engineers that wanted to become AI product managers. But then I realized, no, there are a lot of PMs that want to become AI product managers.

(41:31):
So I did a little online shift there. So what it takes is make sure you find the right audience, make sure to figure out what that audience wants, make sure to have the right duration. One week I find it too short. Two weeks, it'll still be rushed. Three weeks is excellent because you give the opportunity to everyone to present and to keep to know each other on an offline discord community, which is another important part. And then the last thing, you need to have a personal relationship with everyone. So I've messaged everyone, I've seen everyone's application. I met with some people as well just to make sure to answer any questions and concerns because I wanted to make sure that people were comfortable just trusting a stranger like me and paying them to provide knowledge for their course. So it took quite a few iterations, but I was able to get there and now I'm very, very happy about it and I recorded it offline as well for people.

Lenny (42:27):
Has anything had to change in this course? Maybe it's just as the last question, things are moving so fast. Is there anything you've had to rethink, redo since you first built it?

Marily Nika (42:35):
I actually added bonus sections and one bonus section was [inaudible 00:42:38] and how it was trained. This is because I started this new cohort in December and on day one the question I got is, what is this? How did it start? What is going on? How did they train it? So I added the dedicated section for it and I point people to it.

Lenny (42:52):
Amazing. Anything else that you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Marily Nika (42:58):
It was someone that recommended, I actually did a course and in the beginning I laughed and I said, "Wait, people would want to learn from me. Really?" And of course they did. And I'm teaching so many people. So what I want to tell people is don't underestimate this. Try creating your own courses as well. People may want to learn what you take for granted. For them it may be game changing, it can be life changing. So building courses is an amazing thing and we're living in the full [inaudible 00:43:30]. So the course is content, so go try this.

Lenny (43:33):
I find that teaching and at least crystallizing thoughts is one of the best ways to learn it yourself. I imagine you learned a lot about AI much more than even came into it with just putting it together into a course.

Marily Nika (43:44):
Absolutely. And I got some uncomfortable questions that I had no idea how to tackle. People on day one were like, how do I assess the tradeoffs between these two different months? And I had to figure out how to answer these things and how to incorporate them in my course. So learning from the students, learning from the course, learning from explaining is just so viable. So skills that we can get.

Lenny (44:07):
Well with that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, share. We'll see how it all goes. Sound good?

Marily Nika (44:18):
Sounds good.

Lenny (44:19):
Two or three books that you recommend most to other people.

Marily Nika (44:22):
Inspired. It's all about how to create tech products people love.

Lenny (44:28):
Marty Kagan, right?

Marily Nika (44:29):
Yes, that's the one. Great.

Lenny (44:34):
Cool. Anything else? Or that's the one that comes to mind.

Marily Nika (44:35):
You Look Like a Thing and I Love You and I have it right here. It's a great thing, super, super cool. It's about how AI works and why it's making the world a weirder place. It's actually a very fun book. And there's one more, which is a book, a workbook I originally launched with Alana Karen and it's a workbook for women in tech trying to navigate working in tech. It's called Adventures of Women in Tech Workbook. So that's another thing that they want to shamelessly plug in.

Lenny (45:02):
Ah, that's a great choice to plug. Where can folks find that? Is that on Amazon?

Marily Nika (45:06):
Yeah, Amazon.

Lenny (45:07):
Amazing. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to?

Marily Nika (45:11):
I like Boz's podcast. I don't know if you're aware of it. Boz is the CEO of Facebook. He has a great podcast.

Lenny (45:19):
I have not heard it. I do know of Boz. I'll check that out. I didn't know he had a podcast. He had some great writing over the years. Maybe that's why he doesn't write it anymore. He has his podcast. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've loved?

Marily Nika (45:30):
Oh my God, The White Lotus. People were talking about this thing. I ended up just trying it out and me and my husband, we just binge watched the whole thing. Is just so different, so mind blowing, get you excited about going to Hawaii again. It's just really good.

Lenny (45:45):
Have you seen the second season?

Marily Nika (45:46):
I've seen it and it's so much better than the first, which is rare.

Lenny (45:50):
I agree. Awesome. Love that show. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask, and bonus point if it's AI related.

Marily Nika (45:57):
I love to ask people, how would you explain a database to a three year old? And I know it's kind of an AI, not everyone say ai, but I love asking it because people are thinking the [inaudible 00:46:11], like what did you just ask me? But it's so important to be able to explain things in a simple ring and have the storytelling to convince a kid and really explain technical terms to non-technical people.

Lenny (46:23):
Favorite AI based tool that you think people should check out.

Marily Nika (46:27):
Talk about ChatGPT, now I have this on ChatGPT, this is what comes to mind. Well, the Lensa app was pretty cool too, right? We all plugged in our [inaudible 00:46:36] and we're able to see what they would look like as fantastic heroes. I have to say, I tried being the mail version because it was so much cooler than the KingL version, so that's when I recommend to people, try the mail version.

Lenny (46:48):
That's fun. And they actually have pets now. That's what got me the download and pay for it. You can take pictures of your pets and they look so fun. That's like a killer feature right there. Good job Lensa. And the app is Lensa, right?

Marily Nika (47:01):
Yeah. [inaudible 00:47:02]

Lenny (47:02):
Amazing. Marily, thank you so much for spending time with me, sharing your wisdom. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Marily Nika (47:12):
Thank you so much. People can find me on Instagram. I also have a product channel on YouTube that you can check out. I just started it. I'm getting used to the whole process. I'm also kicking off a newsletter, just any social reach out and you'll see all my links.

Lenny (47:28):
How do they find the YouTube channel? How do they find the newsletter?

Marily Nika (47:31):
Typing Marily Nika.

Lenny (47:32):

# Product management theater | Marty Cagan (Silicon Valley Product Group)

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams. They're the only platform with product level AI, meaning it analyzes data across all of your studies to centralize the most important product opportunities, trends, and correlations in one real time feed. Visit sprig.com/lenny to learn more and get 10% off. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's getE-P-P-O.com/lenny. Marty Cagan, welcome back to the podcast.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Who would you say this is most suited for? Is it leaders at companies? Is it ICPMs, everybody? Who do you think would get the most out of this?

Marty Cagan (01:00:36):
We wrote it intentionally, again, unlike the other books. The other books are written for people like us and your audience and my audience. They're product people. These are written for non-product people too. And so the idea is a CEO, a CFO, a head of sale. Anybody who cares about their company changing how they build and wants to help is written for them. So that was one of the hardest parts really, including those kinds of reviewers and making sure all this stuff made sense to them.

Lenny (01:01:08):
So basically if you're listening to this and you're like, I'm working on these teams Marty's describing, I don't think this is optimal. We can do a lot better. We can get a lot more on out feature team, hand this book to your CEO essentially?

Marty Cagan (01:01:22):
And I'd suggest they read it themselves so they know. Because I know I'm going to be talking more about this going forward because I know I need to. Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company. They're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. But really they have a family, they're not going to quit. So I think that's not true. I think there is so much they can do and hopefully they can see that in the book. It's like they can see what they individually can do to push their company in this direction, and at a minimum it'll help their career.

Lenny (01:02:05):
I always love just the message of empowerment and giving people motivation to you can actually make change. You're not stuck in this way of working, and I know you do that a lot. The official title of the book, so it's TRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model. What do you mean when you... There it is. I don't have my copy yet 'cause that hasn't come out in the US yet, otherwise, I'd have it here on my side as well. There it is. It's a beautiful green color by the way. It goes nicely with the other colors. Amazing. Beautiful design, whoever did that. Okay, so the part of the title is Moving to the Product Operating Model. What does that mean?

Marty Cagan (01:02:40):
That was the biggest pain for the book was... 'Cause honestly, I had dodged that question for 20 years. If you look at any of my writing before starting on this book, I just said, "Look, do you want to work like the best or do you want to work like the rest?" That's how we referred to it, the best versus the rest because there is no word, there is no name that talks about the common principles with all the best companies. So we would just say, do you want to work like the best or not? But when I started to write the book, I'm like, okay, I can't just say work like the best. We have to have some name for this, but I don't know if you've come across this Lenny, but you don't want to coin a new term if you can avoid it.

(01:03:27):
It is really painful to try to develop a new term. Some of the companies we worked with use the term product operating model and don't get me wrong, that's not the only term. Some people use the term product led company or product driven company, but those two we just don't like because it gives all the wrong message and the rest of the company thinks it's a power grab. So we wanted to avoid those words. We like product operating model for a couple reasons. One is it's a model, it's a conceptual model. It's not a process. It's not really a thing, it's more of a set of principles and also it's non-threatening to a lot of people. It's just saying, "Look, this is how these companies operate. You can look at it and decide if you think it's good for you too." So we adopted that term, we call it product model for short. And all it really is it boils down to a set of 20 principles and those 20 principles are what we find.

(01:04:36):
Remember we started with this. I was explaining, when I listen to your guests, I'm listening for what's special about each of their companies, but what I'm looking for is the commonality. 'Cause most of the time when I see a successful company, they are living these principles. Principles like you have to experiment. You have to embrace experimentation. If you don't do that, most of this is not possible. Or you have to make sure that everything you release is instrumented so that we can prove the outcome. Stuff like that, that there's a million different methodologies and frameworks and tools and processes, but matters is those principles. And so that's what we mean by that product operating model. There's at a high level we talk about it, is how you decide what you're going to work on? How you decide which problems to solve?

(01:05:33):
That's what most companies do in annual planning, but it's basically the product strategy. That's what your Meta friend was describing that the leaders do. That's their job. The second is how do they solve problems? Do they have the skills to do product discovery like we're talking about? How to actually come up with good solutions that work for the customer and work for the business. That's the second big dimension of the product model. And the third big dimension is how do they actually build, test and deploy product to their customers? Do they do it in a way that is reliable, that is demonstrable where you can show that this generates the outcomes that you need? Those are the three big areas. And then there's a number of competencies. There's four new competencies that most companies don't have, but what makes it tricky is they have people with those titles, but they don't have people with those jobs. The one we've been talking about is product manager.

Lenny (01:06:40):
What would be most interesting to share? You said there's 20 attributes of a power product team.

Marty Cagan (01:06:46):
20 principles.

Lenny (01:06:48):
20 principles. I'm so curious what these are, but I know we don't have time to go through them all. Can you either share a few of those? You shared experimentation as one, or these four what you just mentioned. I'm just curious what these [inaudible 01:06:58]

Marty Cagan (01:06:58):
Well, I could share as much as you want, but the four competencies are product manager. Again, we're talking a serious product manager here, not a product owner, not a feature team product manager. Product manager, real product designer, service design, interaction design, visual design, user research, real product designer, a real tech lead, and then a real product leader, a manager of product design engineering that knows how to coach their people and knows how to do a real product strategy, which is what we were talking about. So those are the four new competencies. For most companies, those are new, meaning they might have people with those names, but they don't have those roles institutionalized.

Lenny (01:07:43):
It's interesting, you're building on the classic triad with this leader above. It's like the stool with something on the stool or something or filling up the stool.

Marty Cagan (01:07:51):
And that is the triad. That's where it came from. The word triad came from those three. We didn't invent that.

Lenny (01:07:58):
Right. But I think the product leader is a really interesting addition there. You can't just have this team off to the side without a product leader overseeing that work.

Marty Cagan (01:08:04):
That's so true because one of the things I really learned with INSPIRED was that it wasn't enough to have the teams do their job. They needed leadership to do their job. So it is both. And that's why I was saying we don't frame it as top-down, bottom-up for that. We frame it as each group doing their job. And when that happens, it's actually a beautiful thing.

Lenny (01:08:28):
We're going to link to a post that you wrote, Product Leadership Theater, which talks about how people do this actually badly and what it looks like when it's just pretend versus actually doing it right.

Marty Cagan (01:08:37):
Good.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Okay. And then what are some of these principles, just to touch on a couple and a few-

Marty Cagan (01:08:42):
Just stop me, but there's a set of principles around the more cultural things, like innovation is more important than predictability. That's a principle. That learning is more important than failure. The principles are more important than process. Some examples of that. In terms of teams, empowered with problems to solve. That's one of your foundational principles. We talked about that, this idea of real ownership, real sense of ownership so that it's theirs. Well, of course in discovery you'd recognize all the principles, but it's about addressing product risks. It's about embracing quick experimentation. It's about testing ideas responsibly. These are principles. And then I did mention a couple of the delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything. These are delivery principles. So none of these should surprise you 'cause they are what's consistent in the good companies that we know, but these are the things that we think matter.

Lenny (01:09:58):
That's awesome. And I imagine people listening to this, if they're in that 10% or 20% of companies that you describe as doing this well are just like, of course. And then the rest are just like, no, there's no way we're going to be able to do that.

Marty Cagan (01:10:09):
You have to realize in most of the rest of the world, they release monthly or mostly quarterly. Think about that. Quarterly releases. Think about it. You cannot take care of your customers. You cannot learn at the pace you need to. By the way, quality is going to be terrible in that model.

Lenny (01:10:30):
I don't want to go on this tangent necessarily, but I know in some cases, like a quarterly release, like Shopify as an example, they have seasonal releases like the winter launch and the summer launch.

Marty Cagan (01:10:40):
And salesforce.com has a big... But don't confuse the actual releasing by the teams with the marketing releases. So it's very normal and I think wise to batch. Because look, most product teams are releasing on the order of 20 times per day. You're going to do a marketing release 20 times a day? That would be useless. So it makes sense to have messaging on a periodic basis, but good companies, by the time they message it, it's live. It's been coming out. We may have released some things dark as you know, but we've got it in production solid. We've proven each thing probably with an AB test.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Airbnb is actually in that same model. Most of the stuff they announced every couple times a year is already out or an experiment to most people. One thing I wanted to clarify, so you call this the product operating model. There's also this role product ops, which you touched on a little bit. Any thoughts on product ops? We've had a few guests here talk about it.

Marty Cagan (01:11:43):
It's tricky. First of all, some people have asked me, is product ops the same as product operating model? No. That was just a very unfortunate name conflict, but product ops is more analogous to DevOps and design ops, that's all. Now, can you use product ops in the product operating model? Absolutely, if you're using one of the definitions that are part of the model. So for example, the heart of product ops in the good companies I know is user research and data analysts. And the only difference is they're now brought together under one product ops leader. That's all. That that is the same. How long has that been with us, Lenny? More than 20 years. Companies have had user research teams and have had data analyst teams to help you make decisions qualitatively and help you make teams quantitatively. So that's not new at all, but it is good. And I think there is some amount of value about bringing that in.

(01:12:52):
Some companies, of course, they interpret and define product ops very differently. A lot of them unfortunately think of it, they focus on the whole phrase of process in governance. That's a huge red flag and I try to tell people, if that's what you see, run. Don't walk away from that. The other thing that's going on in a lot of companies, it is amazing to me how creative companies can be to try to find a way to justify giving product managers assistance because the product manager says too much work, which is really ironic to me 'cause they're usually feature teams that are saying this and I'm like, "It's not even enough for your job." But anyway, they're like, "Too much work." And so they're like, "Well, we need help." And so for a while, they would all have these little associate product managers. And then a lot of companies they have, oh, we also have product owners.

(01:13:51):
Product manager and product owner makes no sense. Huge anti-pattern. Today a lot of companies use the same excuse, but its product manager has product ops people to do the dirty work. No. And honestly, I would not want to be one of those people because I think they're very vulnerable right now.

Lenny (01:14:12):
I've changed my mind on product ops. One reason is because I also was like, "I don't need another person in the loop on everything I'm doing. I just want to have..." I don't know why I would do that even though I have endless work and I have working crazy hours. But I think one of the great things about product ops people that I talk to is there's not many of them. You need one often to do a ton and to help a lot of different teams, so it's not like a team that just grows like crazy.

Marty Cagan (01:14:37):
That's what I like. Same with user research, by the way, and you had a very good guest on that I think tried to make that point as well, a small high leverage group. So it works for data analysts and it works for user research where they are helping the teams do the work they need to do, but that's where it really depends what they're doing. I will tell you I've seen too many companies where the product leaders are not doing their job, so what they do is they hire product ops to try to do their job. They're the ones now responsible for educating the product managers. That's just not good.

Lenny (01:15:13):
I have just a few more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Actually, maybe just one more question. We'll see where this goes. So I've mentioned this earlier that a lot of startup founders are just like, "I do not need product managers. I'm not going to hire them ever. Or maybe I'll wait until I have hundreds of engineers." But then I find many of them change their mind, bring in a PM and they're like, "Oh wow, this is amazing. Why didn't I do this earlier? This person, it's exactly what I needed." And these are guests I've had on the podcast that were like, "We don't need PMs." And then they get one and they're like, "Okay, I see. This is great." Do you have any advice for founders that are in this boat of just like, I don't want product managers, they're going to screw us up, they're going to slow us down? Any advice for this?

Marty Cagan (01:15:53):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm one of the people that tries to discourage them from hiring product managers too soon because a lot of them make the mistake of hiring them too soon. Now, realize what we're talking about here, again, the whole discussion we've had, this is other layer to, I'm talking about a real product manager. If they're using them as project manager, which a lot of times they are, well, I would tell them they're overpaying, but okay, you can get some help for project management. That's not a good use of the CEO's time. But if they're a real product manager and they're worried about value and viability, that is the founder's job. So the founder should be doing that and needs to be doing that, and it usually causes conflict if they bring in a real product manager too soon. It's too many cooks in the kitchen.

(01:16:45):
You need to reach a certain scale before it helps you to have other people responsible for value and viability. That all assumes that they understand real product management, otherwise it's going to lead to very different symptoms.

Lenny (01:17:01):
So I think one piece of advice here is after product-market fit is a better time to hire a product manager. Otherwise, they're just between you and the product and it slows everything down, right?

Marty Cagan (01:17:10):
Yeah. Remember, usually as soon as you get product-market fit, you're working on it for other products and other markets, and so it's an ongoing thing, but while it's small, it usually is most useful just to look at the number of engineers. At a certain number of engineers, usually 20 to 25, it's a lot better if the co-founder is the product person for that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. I was going to ask you if you have a heuristic for engineers and so thank you for preempting that. That's essentially all I had to chat about, Marty. Do you have anything else that you think would be interesting to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Marty Cagan (01:17:51):
Honestly, Lenny, we talked about so many big topics. I'm worried that may have overwhelmed people, I hope not. Because you asked all the hardest topics.

Lenny (01:18:03):
Well, good job me. Good job you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Marty Cagan (01:18:09):
Sure.

Lenny (01:18:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Marty Cagan (01:18:15):
I love the new book from Tony Fadell called Build. It's a wonderful book and he's describing the product model, but for hardware devices and his perspective was fabulous. He had a front row seat to some of the most iconic products in the world, the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest devices. Love it. So I loved his book and I've been recommending it to all kinds of people. Another one I really liked is, do you know Tim Urban, the guy behind Wait But Why?

Lenny (01:18:45):
Absolutely.

Marty Cagan (01:18:46):
I just love the way this guy thinks. And he wrote a book called What's Our Problem? that I found really provocative. Challenged me in a hundred different ways, so love that.

Lenny (01:18:56):
I've been reading about his book writing process as he was writing it over the many years and it was just quite a journey he went on to make that book happen. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Marty Cagan (01:19:09):
Lenny, you couldn't ask that to a worst person 'cause I watch almost nothing, so not a good one for that.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Great. I think that's often for the best. Do you have a favorite interview question that you either use yourself or find useful when interviewing folks, product managers especially?

Marty Cagan (01:19:26):
Well, given how much interviewing I do, I stopped giving out my real favorite questions because they became online. But I do have a go-to question that I pretty much start with everybody and I want to know if they can even define the job of a product manager.

Lenny (01:19:41):
What do you find in the answer and what do you look for? Is it just how close they are to your version of a product manager?

Marty Cagan (01:19:49):
I can tell where they learned from their answer, that's all. They don't have to give my answer. They just shouldn't give the old feature team answer, that's all.

Lenny (01:20:00):
Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love, whether it's software or something physical, something around the house?

Marty Cagan (01:20:06):
I recently got a Rivian, which is amazing that they did an absolutely beautiful job. They're the Airbnb of car companies because the founder's a designer and imagine if a designer designed the next generation car. It's a phenomenally good job.

Lenny (01:20:27):
Wow. I was imagining you could rent people's cars and that sounds pretty cool, but you mean it in a different way. Interestingly, both you and [inaudible 01:20:38] from Meta both had cars as your favorite recent product discovery. He had a Mercedes-Benz. And I made the joke that I hope to give away these products someday and the budget is blowing up with all these cars in the mix.

Marty Cagan (01:20:52):
Well, my favorite thing to do is ride motorcycles and there is a new generation of product that who knows, might save my life one day, but these are literally wireless airbag vests that you wear and it uses AI technology and sensors to decide if it should deploy. Luckily, mine has never had to go off, but I know for a lot of people it saved their lives. That's an example of technology where without the technology, it's a very vulnerable... Even with it, it's vulnerable.

Lenny (01:21:28):
Wait, do you ride motorcycles?

Marty Cagan (01:21:29):
I do.

Lenny (01:21:30):
I had no idea. What bike do you ride?

Marty Cagan (01:21:33):
I have two and they're both BMWs.

Lenny (01:21:36):
Wow. We need to see a picture of this somewhere. That's amazing. I had no idea. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family and find useful either in work or in life?

Marty Cagan (01:21:49):
I don't really have a life motto, but I do have one I share a lot with people because as you might imagine, I think writing really helps me think and I encourage other people to develop their thinking skills and there's a great quote from Leslie Lamport, the guy who... You're not old enough to know this, but he invented one of the first word processors called LaTeX, which I used to use back in the day. But if you're thinking without writing, you just think you're thinking.

Lenny (01:22:21):
There's a version of this that I love and it's the same idea that I don't know what I think until I've written it down. I think Joan Didion said that.

Marty Cagan (01:22:29):
Same idea.

Lenny (01:22:30):
And I so agree. That's why I started writing. I just want to figure this out that I have in my head. Crystallizing something that makes sense. Last question. You've been doing this work for many, many years now. How many years have you been at this?

Marty Cagan (01:22:43):
43.

Lenny (01:22:45):
43 years. What else would you have been doing right now if not having gone down this track?

Marty Cagan (01:22:53):
Oh, well, honestly, I would've been really happy just staying in engineering. I've always loved design too. I think I would've been really happy as a designer. I think no matter what though, I would have been still building something, whether if it was houses or cars or whatever. I like building things.

Lenny (01:23:13):
I love that. You're essentially a one man triad team in this dream. Marty, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. We covered so much stuff. I think we're going to help a lot of people transform. Two final questions, where can folks find your book? When is it available? Where can they reach out if they want to follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:23:34):
The book should be available worldwide in electronic Kindle audio and hardback on March 12th. We'll see, but that's what the publishers promise. And you can find about all of the things I talk about and all our stuff is for free on the website, svpg.com, Silicon Valley Product Group. And if you don't know at least one of the partners, you should try to meet one. We all love meeting the community and I think you'll enjoy it. So hopefully that's useful.

Lenny (01:24:12):
We've had two partners so far. We'll work our way through the rest over time. And I want to make sure you answer the last question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:24:20):
To be honest, a lot of the inspiration for what we write comes from questions from people, and so we love it when people read something and if it works, great, and they tell us, we love that too. But if they have follow-up questions, one of the nice things about the online archive is we'll just go update the article to address the question. So we love that.

Lenny (01:24:40):
You do the same thing.

Marty Cagan (01:24:41):
So feel free.

Lenny (01:24:42):
All right. Amazing. Marty, thank you so much for making time to do this and for being here.

## Transcript

Marty Cagan (00:00:00):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have, agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts.

Lenny (00:00:13):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, people that aren't real product managers.

Marty Cagan (00:00:18):
They're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Because it's a project management role. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes.

Lenny (00:00:27):
What made you decide to write another book and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:00:31):
Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company, like they're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. I think that's not true. There is so much they can do.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Marty Cagan. Marty has been helping product teams and product managers improve their craft, processes and careers for over 20 years. He's worked with more product teams and more product managers than any human alive. He's also written two of the most popular books in the field of product management, INSPIRED and EMPOWERED, and this week he's releasing his newest book, TRANSFORMED. In our conversation, we cover some spicy and important topics. Where the product management field is going, the over hiring of product managers and adjacent functions, a trend he's noticed called product management theater. Also, why most product management advice you find online is giving you the wrong advice and why that's the case. Why many product managers are simply project managers and how to avoid becoming that person. Also, how to avoid hiring that person. What skills you need to work on and build to be an incredible product manager, especially with AI.

(00:01:43):
How to shift your team and company to be more empowered. Signs that you're working on a feature team and why you probably don't want to be there and so much more. If you care about the field of product management and where it's going, you'll absolutely love this episode. With that, I bring you Marty Cagan after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Let me tell you about a product called Sprig. Next gen product teams like Figma and Notion rely on sprig to build products that people love. Sprig is an AI powered platform that enables you to collect relevant product experience insights from the right users so you can make product decisions quickly and confidently.

(00:02:34):
Here's how it works. It all starts with Sprig's precise targeting, which allows you to trigger in-app studies based on user's characteristics and actions taken in product. Then Sprigs AI is layered on top of all studies to instantly surface your product's biggest learnings. Sprig Surveys enables you to target specific users to get relevant and timely feedback. Sprig Replays enables you to capture targeted session clips to see your product experience firsthand. Sprig's AI is a game changer for product teams. They're the only platform with product level AI, meaning it analyzes data across all of your studies to centralize the most important product opportunities, trends, and correlations in one real time feed. Visit sprig.com/lenny to learn more and get 10% off. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:03:36):
Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.

(00:04:19):
Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the AB testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's getE-P-P-O.com/lenny. Marty Cagan, welcome back to the podcast.

Marty Cagan (00:04:49):
Thanks very much Lenny. Thanks for inviting me back.

Lenny (00:04:52):
Thank you for coming back. So our first episode together is still one of the top five most popular episodes of my entire podcast, which is wild because the podcast was much smaller back then. You've also got a book coming out. We're going to talk about that. You've also been getting a lot more spicy in your writing as of late. You've been writing about product management theater and product leadership theater and all these sorts of things. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of these things. I thought I'd start with just asking what is driving this recent spiciness in your writing?

Marty Cagan (00:05:23):
It's conscious. I find myself, I'm aware of myself dialing up the rhetoric around this stuff. I've actually been saying these things for a long time, honestly, and it's on the record. You can read the blog articles from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, but things are changing. And first of all, I should acknowledge, I don't know if you're this way Lenny, but most product people I know like me are paranoid. So we're always worried that things are going to come and just take our customers away and disrupt our products. And so I know that there's a degree of that. I'm always looking at what are the things that could really shake things up in a good way but also in a bad way? And there's been a number of things I've been very worried about for a long time and I think that there's a convergence of factors that are going on and one of the challenges is it's simultaneous.

(00:06:22):
So there are a number of things happening in parallel, which is a recipe for some chaos and a lot of fear. And in the product community, in the design community, in the engineering community, it's there. You can see it. And like you, I talk to people pretty much every day. So I do have a lot of theories about why this is going on and what people can do to best protect themselves, their career, their companies. And so I'm happy to share that, but it's not small. It's not a small set. Maybe before I get into it though, I realize that people should understand where I'm coming from and how it's different than where you're coming from because this perspective... Just to be clear, I think we're both trying to help the product community, but we're trying to do it in very different ways.

(00:07:18):
And I want to be clear, I love the way you do it. In fact, if people don't know, I'm a paid subscriber to yours because I find it incredibly useful for what I want to do. So let's talk about that. You obviously could describe what you do better than anyone, but my take is that you are, and this is what I find valuable, you're sharing a broad range, increasingly broad range of perspectives, people, ways of working, ways of doing products, experiments with the product model, experiments in leadership. I love that. It actually helps me a lot. That's why I subscribe. And I'll be honest, the main reason I took some prodding for me to... I know there's something about actually paying for a subscription when there's a hundred different product related newsletters and stuff, but what happened was you have a lot of subscribers and people that I know would see something and they'd email me and they'd say, "Did you see what Lenny was talking about with Lenny or with whoever? And how do you explain that? What do you think is going on?"

(00:08:29):
And it made me want to watch a lot of these. Some of companies I know, but other ones you've introduced me to that I don't know anybody at. So to me that's incredibly valuable. It's a whole lot easier than the way it used to be, which is a whole lot of traveling to a lot of companies. So I love that. You are helping so many people to get a broader understanding of product. My goal is different, the SVPG. We are also trying to help the product community, but it's interesting when I watch your interviews, you're trying to pry out of people what's special about what they do, which is what I want to hear. But interestingly, what I'm looking for is not what's different, it's what's the same. What we are all about is sharing the principles and the practices that are used consistently by the best product companies. In fact, we have a heuristic, we've never made a secret of this.

(00:09:27):
We are always asked about new techniques and new methods, new processes and we're like, "Look, we need to see it being used by at least several of the companies that have proven they can consistently innovate." If those companies can use it productively, we're all about evangelizing that. We make this clear in every one of the books. We don't invent any of these things. We just, if they work, we like to talk about them. So we are looking for the commonality and mostly we're looking to help a company, whether it's a startup or a large company to have the best possible chance of success. That's the goal for us. It's a different goal. You can see that. So all these data points become interesting as data points, but we're looking for those things that last and you never know. You have to see.

(00:10:25):
For one, I love working with startups, but as you know, a lot of startups are dominated by the founder and the early people and it almost doesn't matter what techniques they use. If they're good, it's amazing what they do. That's just amazing. And so that's probably important to get out of the way.

Lenny (00:10:44):
Yeah, I love this.

Marty Cagan (00:10:45):
Bringing that perspective.

Lenny (00:10:46):
I agree with everything you said. I think we are very different in what we're providing to the product community. And it's interesting being on this side of the microphone is I built a lot of empathy for journalists. I know the Brian Chesky episode is a good example where there's a lot of things there that might sound problematic and you disagreed with. And as me interviewing him, the challenge I have is I have an hour with him and I have to always decide, do I go and push back and try to, hey, is this actually working the way you're describing? Is this actually the right way to approach stuff? Here's why maybe you would not. Versus there's so many things I want to get to and ask him about this stuff. I'm like, oh, which way do I go? And then if I'm pushing back too hard, people are like, "I'm not going to go on this podcast where he is just questioning everything I think." So it's a really interesting role.

Marty Cagan (00:11:27):
I think that's totally fair. And also, I don't think you want to scare off your guests. This is really the platform they have to share what they think is important. I do always find it entertaining because a number of the companies you profile I already know, and it's always fun to hear them describe it versus what I see at their company because of course they're not always same, but that's just human nature. We all do that. And so anyway, I hope you continue doing what you're doing, Lenny, and I'll keep following.

Lenny (00:12:05):
Amazing. I appreciate it. And same to you.

Marty Cagan (00:12:07):
All right.

Lenny (00:12:08):
So with the writing, I think an implication with the way you're describing is basically you're telling people things they don't want to hear but they need to hear. That's the way you think about it, right?

Marty Cagan (00:12:18):
I do. In fact, I've got some very uncomfortable things to talk about, which I know the more intelligent part of me is like, "Don't bring that up." But also the other side of me is like, "But people need to hear it."

Lenny (00:12:36):
So let's talk about it if people need to hear it, which I agree. So you've been talking about this concept of product management theater and product leadership theater. Let's get into it. What does that look like? What is the sign that you're in this theater versus doing it the way you should be doing it?

Marty Cagan (00:12:48):
There is no question that a lot of companies overhired during the pandemic. That was easy to see even while it was going on. And it's not just that they overhired, a lot of them lowered the bar. But at the same time, of course we have a change in the financial world that has really increased the cost of funds. And that's another thing going on simultaneously. And probably one of the biggest things of all, and this is the hardest because it's not happened yet, is the predicted impact of generative AI, right? I don't know if you saw, literally the CEO of NVIDIA the other day was saying don't learn programming.

(00:13:34):
First of all, I'm not even sure that's good advice, but the fact that the CEO of one of the most amazing companies in the world is saying don't learn programming, that's disruptive. And so at a minimum it creates uncertainty among the leaders in the companies, at a minimum. But honestly, I think there's very real impact. I'm convinced of that. I just don't know the real time horizon. I've got a long history of being overly optimistic. I think things are going to happen sooner than they really do. So I don't know when they'll really happen, but that's a big one. Here's another one that I think is not talked nearly enough about, and that is in a lot of companies, especially outside of Silicon Valley, team size has just gotten out of hand. I go into some companies and honestly I can't believe all the ridiculous roles that they have. And I'll go into that more if you want later, but no question that people realize that smaller teams can often produce more and better results.

(00:14:44):
How many of your guests have said as much? I've heard it from many of them. It's reducing the size of the organization ironically can get you a lot more in terms of results. So there's this general appreciation that maybe we overdid it here with all of these roles. And of course I'm talking about agile coaches and product owners and product ops and business analysts and all these assistant product manager types. So we'll go into that if you want, but it's gotten out of hand at a lot of companies. And then the one that I really probably shouldn't bring up just because it's become a religious topic almost. I know it's a super sensitive topic for people, but the reality is with remote employees, both velocity and innovation have taken a real hit. Now we can talk about, don't get me wrong, I don't think we're ever going to go back to the days of big companies having almost all co-located teams.

(00:15:49):
But there is no question, I work with a lot of them, they are all struggling with innovation and velocity. Things go slower and they don't really do that level of innovation that they used to do. And these are big factors, these are macro factors that are going on. And then on top of that, if you get outside of the Silicon Valley bubble, it's even worse because they have been investing at these companies, especially the big companies in all these extra roles. I mentioned agile coaches, but scrum masters and every flavor of project manager you could dream up, they're everywhere and every kind of assistant to product people. I think it's gotten crazy. In fact, I wrote an article a long time ago, something like a decade ago that was very popular at the time called Epic Waste, and I was pointing this out and saying this is crazy. The ironic thing is that the better companies do way more with a lot less.

(00:16:55):
So anyway, the roles. And then what about all the years that have been going on where they think these big companies think the answer lies in processes, especially things like safe, which outside of the Silicon Valley world is depressingly popular? And even though scrum, a lot of people don't even understand simple processes like scrum and they miss the point. So what's going on in so much of the world is they have so little in the way of outcomes to show for all this cost. And we talked about the sheer number of people becomes a problem and the amount of that cost can be shocking and the amount of waste is basically embarrassing. So it is not a surprise to me that companies are reacting to that. The bigger surprise honestly is it's taken so long for so many companies to realize what is going on.

(00:17:51):
And bottom line is today I think everybody, especially outside in those big process and role heavy companies, they need to take a hard look at how they build products and how they serve their customers. And they need to look harder at how the best companies do this with so much less proportional spend and so much more real return and really take a fresh look at how to best meet the needs of their customers. That's what transformation is about, is moving to work like that. And the ones that do that well I think are the ones with the best chance to survive.

Lenny (00:18:33):
I think there's just this broader trend of people just really dislike PMs in a lot of places. There's this just trend of I don't want PMs at my company, I don't want PMs at my startup. For a long time, we're going to have no PMs. It's like this general idea, and I think you're saying a lot of this comes from many people who were hired as product managers that are not good at the job and people's experience with PMs is those sorts of people.

Marty Cagan (00:18:56):
I think it's a different really answer. And I haven't gone into this, but you probably. Those examples, with very few exceptions, and I hear it all the time, almost every day, what you're describing, they're feature teams. And the truth is, and I've been saying this for a long time, the truth is they don't need PMs in a feature team. They don't because it's a project management role, Lenny, and they already have plenty of people who can cover that. And furthermore, a lot of times the engineers or the designers say, "We'd rather do it ourselves than deal with this person that's got this complex and trying to be the boss of everybody and they really don't contribute anything." So that's what's really going on in my view. They are either a delivery team or a feature team, usually a feature team in this model.

(00:19:49):
And I don't blame those people for not finding value in the product manager. They are just not bringing that value. They do bring a little value, in fairness, but, and this is very brutal, but they're dramatically overpaid for the value they provide. Now on the other hand, in a real product team, that's a very different job and I don't see that. In fact, I consider that complaint you're raising as the biggest clue that they're probably our feature team. And then I'll go ask them how they're working and what that person... And then of course the first thing I ask the product manager is how do you define your job? And I bet you've heard a hundred variations of the mealy mouth, squishy, I facilitate this and I do some communication and I herd the cats and I'm listening to that going, man, I would not want to try to defend that job to the CEO.

Lenny (00:20:46):
I know you talk about teams and product teams a lot. I imagine people still aren't 100% sure of exactly what you mean when you say that. So let's spend a little time on just what does it look like when you're on a feature team, feature factory versus an empowered product team?

Marty Cagan (00:21:01):
Well, there's a lot of clues for sure. Some of the easiest is on a feature team, you're basically given a roadmap of output. That's the key, is output. In other words, their features are projects that usually it could have come from an executive, could have come from a big pocket customer, could have come from wherever. But it's a bunch of features and literally you're being asked to design, build, test, deploy that feature. You're usually given dates and timeframes as well, but that's a feature team. You deliver. And don't get me wrong, that's still work, but that's output. It is a lot easier to deliver output than it is to deliver outcomes. And a product team, an empowered product team, instead of being given that roadmap of features, they're given problems to solve. Now they're customer problems or they're business problems or both, but they're given a problem to solve.

(00:21:57):
Usually one or two a quarter on top of of course the keep the lights on kind of work that everybody does, but they're given hard problems to solve and the measure is not ship the thing. The measure is it solves the problem. And that's why really the biggest difference between a strong product company and the rest is strong product companies understand it's all about outcomes. You just don't get points for shipping, you get points for delivering the value. A lot of the CEOs and CFOs I talk to, they resonate best when I frame it as it's about time to money more than time to market. We know how to do time to market. If you insist on time to market, we know how to do that. The techniques are well-known. The harder part is time to money and I know that's what they care about and that's harder and that's what a product team really does.

(00:22:51):
It's only when you sign up for an outcome that you have the needs for a product manager. I would say in the Silicon Valley sense, that's when you need a product manager. Because if you've been asked to solve these problems, that means you have to come up with a solution that's not only usable and feasible, which is what a feature team does, but is also valuable and viable. And that means you need a different set of skills that your engineers and your designers almost never have. That's not a knock on them. Those are very different skillsets. So now you need this person who understands the customers and understands the business deeply. That's where the product manager role came from. That's what they still at a good product company are responsible for. So that's a very different job. It's also if you have a person playing that kind of product manager, it is very unlikely they've got time on their hands to get in the face of the designer and start wire framing for them or start irritating the developers. They've got their own work to do.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And this is essentially the theater you're describing, that people that aren't real product managers doing product management activities, can you just talk about what that looks like?

Marty Cagan (00:24:09):
The biggest example of that is that they carry this title product manager because the whole world largely, thanks to you, knows it's cool, but they're not doing any of the role and they don't have any of the skills. Now of course, what really bothers me is it's not that hard if they are motivated. It's not that hard for them to develop the skills, and that's what I talk to people about. You can raise your game so that you actually can contribute at this level. That's what you should do for your own career, but by the way, and not accidentally, that's what your company needs you to do.

Lenny (00:24:48):
And for people that are listening to this wondering, what are these skills that I need to build to be a real product manager? I think you often say it's mostly focused on value and viability, and that's where a lot of this-

Marty Cagan (00:24:58):
Value and viability is what you are responsible for as a product manager, just like an engineer is responsible for feasibility, it has to be a solution that can be built and delivered. But a product manager is responsible for value and viability. Another way I like to frame this is on a real empowered product team, product manager is a creator, not a facilitator. I always cringe when somebody tells me, oh, my job is to say why? And I'm like, "Well, what do you do for the rest of the week besides the 10 minutes it takes you to say why?" It's ridiculous. People think that. But you know what? On a feature team, when you're scrounging around for some justification of your job, it's not that big a surprise. But no, the why actually comes from the product strategy anyway. You don't even do the why.

(00:25:45):
A product manager is a creator and so there's this side-by-side creation with design and engineering to come up with these solutions. Now, in order to do your job and represent value and viability, there are some real skills that are involved. First of all, you have to really become an expert on your users and customers. I know that I was not allowed to take the product manager role until I had visited 30 customers in person, 15 in the US, 15 in Europe. That was just the person who was coaching me. That was their rule. And all I know is those 30 customers changed my life because I thought I knew our customers and I really didn't. Another is you're supposed to be the expert on the data. How is our product being used? How is that usage changing over time? How is it being purchased? So that's big. Another big one is you are the person on the team that represents the compliance issues, the sales issues, the marketing issues, the financial cost issues, the monetization issues, go to market in general.

(00:26:51):
This is all legal constraints. This is all the product manager. Just think if you don't have this person on the team and you want to empower this team to make decisions, what are you going to do? You're just going to make it up? Or what they usually do is they call meetings with 20 stakeholders all in a room to try to decide these things, and now you've reverted to design by committee. So no, the product manager needs to bring this knowledge. They also need to bring deep understanding of the market. So when I describe these things to a typical product owner, they're like, "We're on different planets." What they learned in a CSPO or a PSPO class was how to manage a backlog in Jira, which to me is very analogous to learning how to operate Google Docs. Of course, that's not the job. That's something we do every day, but it's not the job just any more than...

(00:27:50):
Developers are in Jira every day. Does that mean that's their job? Of course not. Their job is to build. So this is what a product manager contributes. And really the distinction, if you want to think about it on a spectrum, a product owner is one extreme. And honestly, that is a role in a delivery process. That has no business being a dedicated person, really doesn't. And most teams I know, the senior engineer could do it better anyway. Second on the other side of the spectrum is what we're talking about, an empowered product manager. And then a feature team product manager is somewhere in between there. They do more than administer the backlog. They do a lot of project management. And don't get me wrong, project management is important, but it is not product management. And furthermore, in almost every company I see with feature team product managers, they have a boatload of project managers anyway.

(00:28:51):
So you could hear there's some exasperation in my voice because I feel like this has been quite clear for a long time, but most companies are deaf to this. They don't care. And I have theories about why, but that's kind of depressing. But for whatever reason, I feel like now I'm raising the volume because people are now seeing this the hard way because a lot of companies are cutting and these are easily among the most vulnerable people in a company.

Lenny (00:29:27):
Let me actually read a quote from you where you talk about this exact point. You wrote, "I have been warning for several years that delivery team, product owners and feature team product managers are likely to be facing a reckoning as companies realize that these roles are not what they thought they were. From what I can tell, that reckoning has begun and I'm expecting GenAI will only compound this."

Marty Cagan (00:29:48):
That's the pessimistic version of the world. Either I might be overreacting. Might be. I'm not really known for being alarmist, but maybe. It's possible. I hope so, but I doubt it. I think these trends are real. Now, does that mean people are... It's hopeless? They should all start retraining to be, I don't know what, housing construction, something that GenAI won't replace maybe? No. I think what really this does is you need to raise your skills. Enough with the silly facades of delivery teams and feature teams. You should raise your skills. And a lot of product managers, they reach out and they're like, "I know I'm in a feature team and I don't like it." I often use the phrase they're trapped in a feature team and they're like, "This isn't what I signed up for. The New York Times article about product management wasn't this. This was different." And they're like, "What should I do? Should I just leave my company and go to one of these other companies?"

(00:31:01):
And I try to explain that they actually have a lot more agency than they realize. There is a lot an individual contributor... Of course, there's way more than a product leader could do. And that's the biggest shame in all this, is they're not doing this. Most product leaders are not doing this 'cause they of course have a lot of agency, a lot of ability to change a company. But an individual can do it as well. They can raise their game. They can literally do a self-assessment and raise the skills from a product owner or a feature team product manager to a real product manager. At a minimum, I tell people, and I've seen this countless times, at a minimum, your company will appreciate it and probably promote you because you will be one of the few that actually understands these things. Hopefully even more than that, they'll say, hey, why don't we try running a set of teams this way and see how we do? So it can happen from the ground up too.

Lenny (00:32:05):
I imagine many people are wondering, how do I do this? I know you've written books, I guess there's courses, there's all kinds of things. If you could give people a couple tips of how to get better at this and what skills to focus on, what's a quick piece of advice you could share there?

Marty Cagan (00:32:19):
Well, this is maybe the most frustrating thing to me of all. And in fact, I should have answered when you asked me what motivated me to get spicy, what pushed me over the edge. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, I don't know. But it was this article that made the rounds online by probably the biggest certification institution for product managers. And they had this big article saying, "This is what a product manager does." And it was a big graphic, and I'm looking at it and I was thinking, I cannot believe they said this out loud. This is 100% project manager, 100%. They didn't even pretend to put a little of the product, which most people of course are more creative than that. They bend over a little bit to make it look like a product manager, but not even close.

(00:33:11):
And what I realized is what's so frustrating here is you have all these people that realize things aren't good yet most places they turn are just propagating that same model. So these certifications, which in my opinion are bogus, but most people don't know. And just imagine you're a brand new product manager. You look online probably what, 90% of the content out there is from the feature team world or worst. And so unless they get really lucky or they happen to be really lucky and have a manager that is guiding them in a good direction, it just propagates. And you see this all over, articles, books, conference speakers, and a lot of times I can't even bear to watch. And it's not like there aren't great people out there who can speak. It's just that proportionally they're in the minority. So it's not as easy as it should be. Like you're saying, why can't people just go and learn?

(00:34:14):
They can if they're lucky enough to know where to go. Obviously I'm biased. You're biased too. We're biased on this, but people need to take more control of their career and really use their judgment, try to figure out what do you want to be if you want to be in the product world? What do you want to be? What kind of a product manager do you want to be? And if you want to stay, fine, but if you want to do this, then there are good resources for sure. There are good resources out there. And of course, I'm hoping more and more people do that.

Lenny (00:34:59):
I think that's such a powerful insight you just shared, that most of the content you find online about product management is, I think you called it 90%, or it's just from companies that are not doing it the right way, feature teams is the way you described it. Can you talk a bit more about that? Why is that the case? Why don't we hear more from great companies?

Marty Cagan (00:35:18):
In fact, one of the most frustrating things for me is community. One of the things that's great about community... You have one of the biggest communities today, but there's a lot of these communities out there in the product world, product sub communities. And the one I love about them is pretty much everybody you meet genuinely wants to help. Really everybody. The problem is somebody posts a question, happens many times every day, and the majority of the well-meaning people jump in with what they learn at their crappy company. And I'm looking at that and the person is, oh, thank you very much, now I know what to do. And I'm going, "Oh no, there goes another one." It becomes self-propagating. And what are you going to do? Is somebody going to try to police these boards, thousands and thousands of them, like a Lenny endorsed person or a Marty endorsed person? I don't want to do that. You probably don't want to do that.

Lenny (00:35:18):
No.

Marty Cagan (00:36:21):
It's a recipe for disaster. So there are so many reasons it propagates. Most of the books I see, I'm asked to review a lot of the books. I love it when it's an exception and it's like, wow, that's a good book. Teresa Torres's book, Continuous Discovery Habits, good book. Try to get everybody to read that. But that's the exception. And most of the time people are earnestly describing what they learn, not really what good companies do. So it's very difficult because these are not bad people. They're well-meaning.

Lenny (00:37:03):
Do you have any advice for somebody asking questions, getting answers, and having a sense of, should I listen to these people?

Marty Cagan (00:37:10):
It's very much this exists in the whole world, right? Buyer beware. You have to use your judgment. You have to think. Probably the most important skill for product people, and I know this sounds awful, but is really learning how to think critically. And that involves literally evaluating. I know I talk to people all the time when I help them for their interviewing. I say, "Look, the most important thing, you need to do some research on the manager that will be your direct manager. Do some background research. Go look at where they worked. It's all on LinkedIn. Check out those companies, check out that product. Make sure you are prepared there because that's what really matters. Not so much the company, but who's going to coach you." So there's a lot that people can do to prepare themselves, arm themselves, take more ownership of their career.

Lenny (00:38:04):
What's interesting, I'm sure you'll run into this and I'll just share something that I thought of. So while I was at Airbnb, I was reading your stuff and I was like, "Who works like this? He's talking about all these companies that are working in this strange way of just being given a roadmap." I'm like, "No way. This is not a thing. What is he writing about?" And it's because I was working at a company that does things well, and I know you disagree with where things have gotten. But anyway, so I imagine many people listening to this are like, I don't believe this is how a lot of companies work. What are you talking about? And then I also imagine there's a large percentage of people that work at a feature factory and they're just like, no, it's fine. It's not actually the way you're describing. So I bet this is quite frustrating for you.

Marty Cagan (00:38:48):
Yeah, I've experienced that 'cause I spent most of my career in that same bubble, and I was so surprised to find that people didn't work the way we did. I remember when it was too, because I was a developer at the time for developer tools, and I was building tools assuming that people were building like we built. And then I was sent out, I remember because one of the most eye-opening visits was my very first visit to Walmart's headquarters. And they were doing things so differently. They had just very different way of working, very different equipment, just everything. And it was a wake-up call. It was like, you know what? I'm living in a bubble. Silicon Valley is not like most of the world here. And of course I realized that why not? Why don't companies in Arkansas and India and everywhere else have the access to the same methods and tools and techniques? And so that became the inspiration for Silicon Valley Product Group, was to spread those things.

(00:39:56):
But I've had that exact conversation. I remember as you're saying it, the first time Shreyas Doshi told me the same thing. He was asking me, 'cause he had known me, and I'm like, "I know you write about this stuff, but I really can't believe people are doing this." And I'm like, "Shreyas, I wish it wasn't true." But he doesn't doubt it today.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah, 'cause he is doing a lot of that work now too. I'm curious if it's okay for people to be on a feature team and just stick with it and be happy. There's actually this LinkedIn post today by this PM, [inaudible 00:40:31] Ben Erez who talks about how if there's a B2B sales driven company, maybe it's okay for it to be feature factory where people know exactly what you need to build. You build these things, it's fine. We don't need you to inform our outcomes. Thoughts on that? Is it ever okay to just be like, it's fine?

Marty Cagan (00:40:48):
Well, my first answer is this is not an accident why most B2B software is such crap. It is horrible. And of course, the ones that really stand out, they usually are not this way. So sales driven product, don't get me wrong. There's companies like Oracle that are massively valuable, driven with sales driven product, but do you really want to be Oracle or do you want to be SAP? Does anybody like those products out there? I don't know. I'm not sure I've ever met anybody that didn't hate those products. So no, I'd say that's just bad product. Now, I would argue that some of my favorite examples... In fact, in the new book we highlighted a classic sales driven financial services company moving to the product model and how it dramatically improved things for the sales organization.

(00:41:48):
So there's a bigger reason I think so many sales driven companies exist, is that most of the time in those companies, the CEOs are not product people and that's why they run that way. And until and unless the CEO decides this is not very good, usually because some good product company comes along and takes away their customers, that's probably not going to change.

Lenny (00:42:13):
Got it. So your feedback there essentially is sure you can operate this way. You're not actually going to build a great product and long term you're going to run into competition [inaudible 00:42:21]?

Marty Cagan (00:42:20):
The other thing I'd argue, Lenny, is an empowered product team can do everything a feature team can do and more. And once in a while I do hear somebody say, why isn't it good enough to be a feature team? How do you answer that really? To me, it is like, why are you in this business? Do you really not care what your customers think about your product? Seriously? I know I would never hire you if I had any say because that's one of the first things we want. We want people to genuinely care about our customers and about our business and making lives better for them. So I don't have a lot of sympathy for those people. I do know that there's plenty of resources for them, so they're fine. It's the people that really want to do better than that.

Lenny (00:43:16):
Reminds me of something your colleague Christian said on our podcast episode of how lucky are we to get to solve people's problems and help them?

Marty Cagan (00:43:24):
Christian is a living example of what we're talking about. Absolutely. He lives for these opportunities.

(00:44:22):
I want to touch on something. So I interviewed the CTO of Meta, and you made this really interesting point. So when I think of Meta/Facebook, I always imagine them as a very bottom-up culture. People on teams build experiments, run things. There's not a lot of do this, do that, but the way that he framed it is it's actually very top-down at Meta. Zuck and the execs come up with here's what we're working on, here's our strategy, here's our big bets. And so he sees it actually as a much more top-down than a bottom-up team, but it seems it comes across as bottom-up, I guess. I know there's a difference between bottom-up versus top-down versus featured factory and empowered product team. But I guess thoughts on that?

Marty Cagan (00:45:03):
So first of all, I would argue what he described is exactly what I see in good product companies, exactly. But we don't frame it as top-down. Top-down is really means something very different. In fact, handing a team a roadmap of features, that's very top-down. Another very common misunderstanding, which comes, again, a lot of the agile coaches, they have misguided so many organizations, but product teams don't do product strategy. Product leaders do product strategy. They need to do the product strategy. And look, I'm not the biggest fan of Meta, but Zuck is very good at product, very good. That's the problem in the world. He's so good at it. But that is the job, is to make these strategic decisions, the focus decisions, the bets you're going to place. But then in a good organization, you give those bets to the teams and you really do give them latitude to figure it out.

(00:46:08):
And honestly, it's been a while since I worked with Facebook at the time, but they had very good teams, very good product teams, serious cross-functional, serious engineers, serious product managers and designers, and they could solve very hard problems and that is what made them good. So I don't frame that as top-down. I frame that as product leaders doing their job and product teams doing their job. It's a very common misunderstanding that many people have about what empowerment even means. Empowerment does not mean you set up this product team and they go decide what to work on. No, that would just be anarchy, right? You'd have 50 teams doing 50 things. Instead, empowerment means the leaders do their job, come up with the bets, and then the teams are able to figure out the best way to solve those problems.

Lenny (00:47:06):
Awesome. That's a great clarification. I think a lot of people don't totally get that. So this is actually really helpful, I think, for a lot of people. Speaking of Meta, there's another product leader at Meta. He was actually one of the former guests and actually also one of the most popular episodes, Nikhyl Singhal. And he works with a lot of CPOs and heads of product at companies. The way he described it, he's noticed there's this reboot in what the PM role has been over the past couple of years because of the end of the [inaudible 00:47:31] era. So the way he sees it is for the past decade, PMs are mostly responsible as growth people. They're growing existing products, they have product market fit or they think they do and they're just optimizing, scaling. And now that the money has gone away, there's a return to building, finding product-market fit validation and discovery. I'm curious if you see that. Do you see a shift in what PMs should be doing in the last couple of years post [inaudible 00:47:58]?

Marty Cagan (00:47:57):
So yes and no. I think he's right in general, but there's a really important nuance. Many teams that aren't very good yet, they do exactly what he described. He describes as a gross hacking, I describe it as optimization. All they're doing is these low risk simple experiments. They live behind the AB test of just doing like, we're going to change the call to action here and maybe more people will register, that kind of test. Should they do that? Absolutely. Is that product really? Not really. That's not discovery, that's optimization. Now, in many companies they do that because they're given a roadmap of all the features. So all they can really fit in are these little optimization tests. But in others, they're scared to do anything else. They literally don't want to break it. And so I find that situation that he described in many companies that need to transform.

(00:48:58):
So I would argue what he's probably seeing mostly is a team that's learning how to go from a feature team to a product team. Now, has that happened more in the last two years? I would like to believe so, but I don't know. Some days I feel like yes, he's right. Some days I feel like I don't know who he's talking to because these people are still stuck doing optimization work. And so there's probably a lot of nuance there. In general, I think yes, but I don't think it's tied to interest rates. I don't think it's tied to that. I think it's more tied to the quality of the leadership and the need of the business to do more than optimization.

Lenny (00:49:44):
I know people ask you this all the time, but I'm curious, is there anything big you're seeing change in the PM role broadly?

Marty Cagan (00:49:51):
We've talked about quite a few big dynamics that are changing. Interestingly, what we're really been talking about is the different definitions of the PM role. And so if we hold one of those definitions constant, let's say we are focused now on the empowered product manager, the one you and I grew up with, and those are the ones that are responsible for value and viability. In general, I think the principles are stable and I think they will remain stable. However, the techniques are undergoing some radical changes, especially with generative AI. Don't get me wrong, I've been living this every day as most of us have. I don't have it figured out. In fact, I recently changed my advice because I used to say, start with ChatGPT, go from there and I'll help you make that great. We'll go from there.

(00:50:48):
And what I kept seeing was people taking what they get too literally, too seriously, too much value, and they were heading off in a wrong direction and then they were optimizing that. There's a lot going on right now. It's a moving target. Depends which system you're using and the day of the week now on what you're at, but whatever. Now I've been recommending to people that they think through the answer first. Really get them to think, put something down, then use ChatGPT to see if you can't improve on that, to see if you can't challenge that, to see if you can't make your argument tighter. So I've reversed and I did that because people are trusting the results too much.

Lenny (00:51:43):
And when you talk about what they start with, is it like, here's a strategy I'm thinking for this product, or is it like a PRD [inaudible 00:51:48]

Marty Cagan (00:51:47):
Yeah, certainly you can use it for a spec, a PRD. You can certainly use it for strategy. You can certainly use it for even things like triaging bugs. It's hard to think of something you can't use it for. The harder question is what is it good for?

Lenny (00:52:07):
Something along those lines I wanted to chat about. Something I've been thinking about. I want to write a post about this, is which skills of a product manager will be most disrupted by AI? So I think short term, there's communication is getting improved. You can improve your writing strategy. Maybe like here's my strategy, give me some feedback. So I think things are being optimized a bit through ChatGPT and tools like that. But in the five or 10 years, are there any skills that will potentially go away or 95% of it will be done by AI? And if so, where do you see most of that change happening in the skillsets?

Marty Cagan (00:52:38):
Absolutely. And I think that is happening more on the engineering side right now and also on the design side, but I fully expect it will happen. Like I said at the beginning, I don't know when really because that timing is hard question, but this is another one of my arguments to people of why you need to uplevel your skills. If you are fundamentally a backlog administrator, good luck protecting that because already people are doing that. It's only a matter of time before that becomes pretty well-supported. That is not a good job prospect. Now, then we can talk about a feature team, project manager. There's very little that's going on in there that is truly value add. Most of these are administrative kinds of things that can be done at least significantly with help. So I wouldn't feel confident if I was a feature team product manager that I could keep doing this for any amount of years at least.

(00:53:45):
Now, for an empowered product manager, if your responsibility is value and viability, if you boil it down, that's the real challenge left with ChatGPT or GenAI, is viability becomes even more the important question. There's some very hard things left. So designers, I think the real product designers at the top of the chain, they're going to be incredibly important and of course tech leads are going to be incredibly important more than ever. But for a product manager, especially with viability, I've been on so many of these calls where we've been talking about the implications of probabilistic software versus deterministic software and what is okay? The lawyers are weighing in already with the legal perspective, but also ethical perspective and just if this is mission critical, is this something that we could be okay with having a probabilistic answer?

(00:54:49):
We don't know, trying to figure that out. So what is that really? That's a viability and a value question. So a lot more is landing squarely on the product manager than I think in general in the past.

Lenny (00:55:04):
Can you talk about viability, just so people know what you mean when you say that? What's the one sentence definition of what viability means?

Marty Cagan (00:55:09):
So value means for the customer, viability means for your business. So that means it works for your business. You can sell it, market it. It's legal, you can service it. It's compliance. All of these constraints. Remember Airbnb, it wasn't so hard to get people to sign up. It was hard to make listings legal in San Francisco. That's the hard part, is the compliance side.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I want to talk about your book. Is there anything else along these lines before we get into your book that you thought would be interesting to touch on or share?

Marty Cagan (00:55:45):
I think that's good. We covered a lot. We covered a lot.

Lenny (00:55:48):
We did. I imagine we covered some of the elements of your book, but let's talk about the book. So this is your third book, is that right?

Marty Cagan (00:55:55):
Yes.

Lenny (00:55:56):
Okay. What made you decide to write another book and add an addition to the Marty Cagan cannon and what is it about?

Marty Cagan (00:56:05):
This is a different one though. It's different kind because INSPIRED, hopefully you know, is for product teams and product managers. It's really a book about product discovery. And then EMPOWER is really about product leadership, vision strategy, team topology, coaching. It's all about that. And that was the original idea. We would share those techniques 'cause that's what we share. But the single most common question we got honestly from the first edition of INSPIRED was that people would read the book and they would say, I love this, I want to do this. But have you ever seen our company? We are so far away from that. We are like night and day. And in fact, a lot of people would tell me point blank, there's no way their company's going to go along with this. And so what they were asking was, how in the world do you transform to work like this?

(00:57:01):
And we've been getting that question for years now. That's really what my partners, Christian, Jonathan, Christopher, Leah, that's what they do is they help companies to transform. That's what we've been doing. But we do that on a one-off basis. There's only five of us. How many companies could we possibly work with? So we realized that this question was a global question. And if we've written books that explain, maybe you want to work this way, but we don't address how to change to work this way, that's leaving people without that hard part. So the goal of TRANSFORMED, unlike the other books, was to share how to actually change. There are techniques in TRANSFORMED as well, but there are transformation techniques. There are change techniques like the use of pilot teams or spreading things out to divide and conquer on some of the transformation work.

(00:58:01):
So the other thing we wanted to do, in fact, we made a rule for ourselves. We knew we needed lots of examples, case studies, but we said it's too easy to include Silicon Valley companies because Airbnb was born in this model. They were designers, but still they were a Silicon Valley company. It was a big advantage for Airbnb over say your favorite bank or whatever that was not born in this way of working. So we said all our examples are going to be from outside Silicon Valley world. They're all companies, most of them pre-internet, that had to change dramatically to work this way. And not only were we going to show how they changed, but we were going to show what they were able to do when they changed, which to me is the coolest part, seeing the innovation. Some of these innovations, honestly, Lenny, are as impressive as anything I've seen Amazon do and that's saying a lot.

(00:58:59):
Amazon in my opinion is the top of the pack and so that's impressive, what Trainline in the UK was able to do. A company I had never known before a few years ago in Saudi Arabia called Almosafer, a travel agency. They own, I forget what it is, 80 plus percent of the market over Expedia, over the big guys in the US because they actually learned this stuff and were able to do it. And we have a dozen examples from all over the world, Brazil, Virginia, everywhere, not Silicon Valley. In healthcare and car sales and fitness, all over the place. Honestly there was a few reasons. One is we wanted them to understand what it really means to move to this way of working. No fluff, just what does it really mean? Otherwise, how are they going to get there if they don't even know where there is? Then we wanted them to believe it's possible to transform. We're the first ones to say it's not easy, but we wanted them to believe it's possible.

(01:00:10):
And the third thing is we wanted to get them excited about what they'd be able to do after they transformed. And those were the three things we were trying to do in the book. And so that's different than our other books, but hopefully it makes the other books more accessible. They'll be able to apply more of them.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Who would you say this is most suited for? Is it leaders at companies? Is it ICPMs, everybody? Who do you think would get the most out of this?

Marty Cagan (01:00:36):
We wrote it intentionally, again, unlike the other books. The other books are written for people like us and your audience and my audience. They're product people. These are written for non-product people too. And so the idea is a CEO, a CFO, a head of sale. Anybody who cares about their company changing how they build and wants to help is written for them. So that was one of the hardest parts really, including those kinds of reviewers and making sure all this stuff made sense to them.

Lenny (01:01:08):
So basically if you're listening to this and you're like, I'm working on these teams Marty's describing, I don't think this is optimal. We can do a lot better. We can get a lot more on out feature team, hand this book to your CEO essentially?

Marty Cagan (01:01:22):
And I'd suggest they read it themselves so they know. Because I know I'm going to be talking more about this going forward because I know I need to. Too many people in our industry view themselves as a victim of their company. They're stuck in a feature team and there's nothing they can do about it other than quit. But really they have a family, they're not going to quit. So I think that's not true. I think there is so much they can do and hopefully they can see that in the book. It's like they can see what they individually can do to push their company in this direction, and at a minimum it'll help their career.

Lenny (01:02:05):
I always love just the message of empowerment and giving people motivation to you can actually make change. You're not stuck in this way of working, and I know you do that a lot. The official title of the book, so it's TRANSFORMED: Moving to the Product Operating Model. What do you mean when you... There it is. I don't have my copy yet 'cause that hasn't come out in the US yet, otherwise, I'd have it here on my side as well. There it is. It's a beautiful green color by the way. It goes nicely with the other colors. Amazing. Beautiful design, whoever did that. Okay, so the part of the title is Moving to the Product Operating Model. What does that mean?

Marty Cagan (01:02:40):
That was the biggest pain for the book was... 'Cause honestly, I had dodged that question for 20 years. If you look at any of my writing before starting on this book, I just said, "Look, do you want to work like the best or do you want to work like the rest?" That's how we referred to it, the best versus the rest because there is no word, there is no name that talks about the common principles with all the best companies. So we would just say, do you want to work like the best or not? But when I started to write the book, I'm like, okay, I can't just say work like the best. We have to have some name for this, but I don't know if you've come across this Lenny, but you don't want to coin a new term if you can avoid it.

(01:03:27):
It is really painful to try to develop a new term. Some of the companies we worked with use the term product operating model and don't get me wrong, that's not the only term. Some people use the term product led company or product driven company, but those two we just don't like because it gives all the wrong message and the rest of the company thinks it's a power grab. So we wanted to avoid those words. We like product operating model for a couple reasons. One is it's a model, it's a conceptual model. It's not a process. It's not really a thing, it's more of a set of principles and also it's non-threatening to a lot of people. It's just saying, "Look, this is how these companies operate. You can look at it and decide if you think it's good for you too." So we adopted that term, we call it product model for short. And all it really is it boils down to a set of 20 principles and those 20 principles are what we find.

(01:04:36):
Remember we started with this. I was explaining, when I listen to your guests, I'm listening for what's special about each of their companies, but what I'm looking for is the commonality. 'Cause most of the time when I see a successful company, they are living these principles. Principles like you have to experiment. You have to embrace experimentation. If you don't do that, most of this is not possible. Or you have to make sure that everything you release is instrumented so that we can prove the outcome. Stuff like that, that there's a million different methodologies and frameworks and tools and processes, but matters is those principles. And so that's what we mean by that product operating model. There's at a high level we talk about it, is how you decide what you're going to work on? How you decide which problems to solve?

(01:05:33):
That's what most companies do in annual planning, but it's basically the product strategy. That's what your Meta friend was describing that the leaders do. That's their job. The second is how do they solve problems? Do they have the skills to do product discovery like we're talking about? How to actually come up with good solutions that work for the customer and work for the business. That's the second big dimension of the product model. And the third big dimension is how do they actually build, test and deploy product to their customers? Do they do it in a way that is reliable, that is demonstrable where you can show that this generates the outcomes that you need? Those are the three big areas. And then there's a number of competencies. There's four new competencies that most companies don't have, but what makes it tricky is they have people with those titles, but they don't have people with those jobs. The one we've been talking about is product manager.

Lenny (01:06:40):
What would be most interesting to share? You said there's 20 attributes of a power product team.

Marty Cagan (01:06:46):
20 principles.

Lenny (01:06:48):
20 principles. I'm so curious what these are, but I know we don't have time to go through them all. Can you either share a few of those? You shared experimentation as one, or these four what you just mentioned. I'm just curious what these [inaudible 01:06:58]

Marty Cagan (01:06:58):
Well, I could share as much as you want, but the four competencies are product manager. Again, we're talking a serious product manager here, not a product owner, not a feature team product manager. Product manager, real product designer, service design, interaction design, visual design, user research, real product designer, a real tech lead, and then a real product leader, a manager of product design engineering that knows how to coach their people and knows how to do a real product strategy, which is what we were talking about. So those are the four new competencies. For most companies, those are new, meaning they might have people with those names, but they don't have those roles institutionalized.

Lenny (01:07:43):
It's interesting, you're building on the classic triad with this leader above. It's like the stool with something on the stool or something or filling up the stool.

Marty Cagan (01:07:51):
And that is the triad. That's where it came from. The word triad came from those three. We didn't invent that.

Lenny (01:07:58):
Right. But I think the product leader is a really interesting addition there. You can't just have this team off to the side without a product leader overseeing that work.

Marty Cagan (01:08:04):
That's so true because one of the things I really learned with INSPIRED was that it wasn't enough to have the teams do their job. They needed leadership to do their job. So it is both. And that's why I was saying we don't frame it as top-down, bottom-up for that. We frame it as each group doing their job. And when that happens, it's actually a beautiful thing.

Lenny (01:08:28):
We're going to link to a post that you wrote, Product Leadership Theater, which talks about how people do this actually badly and what it looks like when it's just pretend versus actually doing it right.

Marty Cagan (01:08:37):
Good.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Okay. And then what are some of these principles, just to touch on a couple and a few-

Marty Cagan (01:08:42):
Just stop me, but there's a set of principles around the more cultural things, like innovation is more important than predictability. That's a principle. That learning is more important than failure. The principles are more important than process. Some examples of that. In terms of teams, empowered with problems to solve. That's one of your foundational principles. We talked about that, this idea of real ownership, real sense of ownership so that it's theirs. Well, of course in discovery you'd recognize all the principles, but it's about addressing product risks. It's about embracing quick experimentation. It's about testing ideas responsibly. These are principles. And then I did mention a couple of the delivery principles, things like small frequent uncoupled releases. For most companies that's CI/CD, instrumentation of everything, monitoring of everything. These are delivery principles. So none of these should surprise you 'cause they are what's consistent in the good companies that we know, but these are the things that we think matter.

Lenny (01:09:58):
That's awesome. And I imagine people listening to this, if they're in that 10% or 20% of companies that you describe as doing this well are just like, of course. And then the rest are just like, no, there's no way we're going to be able to do that.

Marty Cagan (01:10:09):
You have to realize in most of the rest of the world, they release monthly or mostly quarterly. Think about that. Quarterly releases. Think about it. You cannot take care of your customers. You cannot learn at the pace you need to. By the way, quality is going to be terrible in that model.

Lenny (01:10:30):
I don't want to go on this tangent necessarily, but I know in some cases, like a quarterly release, like Shopify as an example, they have seasonal releases like the winter launch and the summer launch.

Marty Cagan (01:10:40):
And salesforce.com has a big... But don't confuse the actual releasing by the teams with the marketing releases. So it's very normal and I think wise to batch. Because look, most product teams are releasing on the order of 20 times per day. You're going to do a marketing release 20 times a day? That would be useless. So it makes sense to have messaging on a periodic basis, but good companies, by the time they message it, it's live. It's been coming out. We may have released some things dark as you know, but we've got it in production solid. We've proven each thing probably with an AB test.

Lenny (01:11:25):
Airbnb is actually in that same model. Most of the stuff they announced every couple times a year is already out or an experiment to most people. One thing I wanted to clarify, so you call this the product operating model. There's also this role product ops, which you touched on a little bit. Any thoughts on product ops? We've had a few guests here talk about it.

Marty Cagan (01:11:43):
It's tricky. First of all, some people have asked me, is product ops the same as product operating model? No. That was just a very unfortunate name conflict, but product ops is more analogous to DevOps and design ops, that's all. Now, can you use product ops in the product operating model? Absolutely, if you're using one of the definitions that are part of the model. So for example, the heart of product ops in the good companies I know is user research and data analysts. And the only difference is they're now brought together under one product ops leader. That's all. That that is the same. How long has that been with us, Lenny? More than 20 years. Companies have had user research teams and have had data analyst teams to help you make decisions qualitatively and help you make teams quantitatively. So that's not new at all, but it is good. And I think there is some amount of value about bringing that in.

(01:12:52):
Some companies, of course, they interpret and define product ops very differently. A lot of them unfortunately think of it, they focus on the whole phrase of process in governance. That's a huge red flag and I try to tell people, if that's what you see, run. Don't walk away from that. The other thing that's going on in a lot of companies, it is amazing to me how creative companies can be to try to find a way to justify giving product managers assistance because the product manager says too much work, which is really ironic to me 'cause they're usually feature teams that are saying this and I'm like, "It's not even enough for your job." But anyway, they're like, "Too much work." And so they're like, "Well, we need help." And so for a while, they would all have these little associate product managers. And then a lot of companies they have, oh, we also have product owners.

(01:13:51):
Product manager and product owner makes no sense. Huge anti-pattern. Today a lot of companies use the same excuse, but its product manager has product ops people to do the dirty work. No. And honestly, I would not want to be one of those people because I think they're very vulnerable right now.

Lenny (01:14:12):
I've changed my mind on product ops. One reason is because I also was like, "I don't need another person in the loop on everything I'm doing. I just want to have..." I don't know why I would do that even though I have endless work and I have working crazy hours. But I think one of the great things about product ops people that I talk to is there's not many of them. You need one often to do a ton and to help a lot of different teams, so it's not like a team that just grows like crazy.

Marty Cagan (01:14:37):
That's what I like. Same with user research, by the way, and you had a very good guest on that I think tried to make that point as well, a small high leverage group. So it works for data analysts and it works for user research where they are helping the teams do the work they need to do, but that's where it really depends what they're doing. I will tell you I've seen too many companies where the product leaders are not doing their job, so what they do is they hire product ops to try to do their job. They're the ones now responsible for educating the product managers. That's just not good.

Lenny (01:15:13):
I have just a few more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Actually, maybe just one more question. We'll see where this goes. So I've mentioned this earlier that a lot of startup founders are just like, "I do not need product managers. I'm not going to hire them ever. Or maybe I'll wait until I have hundreds of engineers." But then I find many of them change their mind, bring in a PM and they're like, "Oh wow, this is amazing. Why didn't I do this earlier? This person, it's exactly what I needed." And these are guests I've had on the podcast that were like, "We don't need PMs." And then they get one and they're like, "Okay, I see. This is great." Do you have any advice for founders that are in this boat of just like, I don't want product managers, they're going to screw us up, they're going to slow us down? Any advice for this?

Marty Cagan (01:15:53):
Yeah. Well, first of all, I'm one of the people that tries to discourage them from hiring product managers too soon because a lot of them make the mistake of hiring them too soon. Now, realize what we're talking about here, again, the whole discussion we've had, this is other layer to, I'm talking about a real product manager. If they're using them as project manager, which a lot of times they are, well, I would tell them they're overpaying, but okay, you can get some help for project management. That's not a good use of the CEO's time. But if they're a real product manager and they're worried about value and viability, that is the founder's job. So the founder should be doing that and needs to be doing that, and it usually causes conflict if they bring in a real product manager too soon. It's too many cooks in the kitchen.

(01:16:45):
You need to reach a certain scale before it helps you to have other people responsible for value and viability. That all assumes that they understand real product management, otherwise it's going to lead to very different symptoms.

Lenny (01:17:01):
So I think one piece of advice here is after product-market fit is a better time to hire a product manager. Otherwise, they're just between you and the product and it slows everything down, right?

Marty Cagan (01:17:10):
Yeah. Remember, usually as soon as you get product-market fit, you're working on it for other products and other markets, and so it's an ongoing thing, but while it's small, it usually is most useful just to look at the number of engineers. At a certain number of engineers, usually 20 to 25, it's a lot better if the co-founder is the product person for that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. I was going to ask you if you have a heuristic for engineers and so thank you for preempting that. That's essentially all I had to chat about, Marty. Do you have anything else that you think would be interesting to share or touch on or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Marty Cagan (01:17:51):
Honestly, Lenny, we talked about so many big topics. I'm worried that may have overwhelmed people, I hope not. Because you asked all the hardest topics.

Lenny (01:18:03):
Well, good job me. Good job you. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Marty Cagan (01:18:09):
Sure.

Lenny (01:18:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Marty Cagan (01:18:15):
I love the new book from Tony Fadell called Build. It's a wonderful book and he's describing the product model, but for hardware devices and his perspective was fabulous. He had a front row seat to some of the most iconic products in the world, the iPod, the iPhone, the Nest devices. Love it. So I loved his book and I've been recommending it to all kinds of people. Another one I really liked is, do you know Tim Urban, the guy behind Wait But Why?

Lenny (01:18:45):
Absolutely.

Marty Cagan (01:18:46):
I just love the way this guy thinks. And he wrote a book called What's Our Problem? that I found really provocative. Challenged me in a hundred different ways, so love that.

Lenny (01:18:56):
I've been reading about his book writing process as he was writing it over the many years and it was just quite a journey he went on to make that book happen. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Marty Cagan (01:19:09):
Lenny, you couldn't ask that to a worst person 'cause I watch almost nothing, so not a good one for that.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Great. I think that's often for the best. Do you have a favorite interview question that you either use yourself or find useful when interviewing folks, product managers especially?

Marty Cagan (01:19:26):
Well, given how much interviewing I do, I stopped giving out my real favorite questions because they became online. But I do have a go-to question that I pretty much start with everybody and I want to know if they can even define the job of a product manager.

Lenny (01:19:41):
What do you find in the answer and what do you look for? Is it just how close they are to your version of a product manager?

Marty Cagan (01:19:49):
I can tell where they learned from their answer, that's all. They don't have to give my answer. They just shouldn't give the old feature team answer, that's all.

Lenny (01:20:00):
Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love, whether it's software or something physical, something around the house?

Marty Cagan (01:20:06):
I recently got a Rivian, which is amazing that they did an absolutely beautiful job. They're the Airbnb of car companies because the founder's a designer and imagine if a designer designed the next generation car. It's a phenomenally good job.

Lenny (01:20:27):
Wow. I was imagining you could rent people's cars and that sounds pretty cool, but you mean it in a different way. Interestingly, both you and [inaudible 01:20:38] from Meta both had cars as your favorite recent product discovery. He had a Mercedes-Benz. And I made the joke that I hope to give away these products someday and the budget is blowing up with all these cars in the mix.

Marty Cagan (01:20:52):
Well, my favorite thing to do is ride motorcycles and there is a new generation of product that who knows, might save my life one day, but these are literally wireless airbag vests that you wear and it uses AI technology and sensors to decide if it should deploy. Luckily, mine has never had to go off, but I know for a lot of people it saved their lives. That's an example of technology where without the technology, it's a very vulnerable... Even with it, it's vulnerable.

Lenny (01:21:28):
Wait, do you ride motorcycles?

Marty Cagan (01:21:29):
I do.

Lenny (01:21:30):
I had no idea. What bike do you ride?

Marty Cagan (01:21:33):
I have two and they're both BMWs.

Lenny (01:21:36):
Wow. We need to see a picture of this somewhere. That's amazing. I had no idea. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family and find useful either in work or in life?

Marty Cagan (01:21:49):
I don't really have a life motto, but I do have one I share a lot with people because as you might imagine, I think writing really helps me think and I encourage other people to develop their thinking skills and there's a great quote from Leslie Lamport, the guy who... You're not old enough to know this, but he invented one of the first word processors called LaTeX, which I used to use back in the day. But if you're thinking without writing, you just think you're thinking.

Lenny (01:22:21):
There's a version of this that I love and it's the same idea that I don't know what I think until I've written it down. I think Joan Didion said that.

Marty Cagan (01:22:29):
Same idea.

Lenny (01:22:30):
And I so agree. That's why I started writing. I just want to figure this out that I have in my head. Crystallizing something that makes sense. Last question. You've been doing this work for many, many years now. How many years have you been at this?

Marty Cagan (01:22:43):
43.

Lenny (01:22:45):
43 years. What else would you have been doing right now if not having gone down this track?

Marty Cagan (01:22:53):
Oh, well, honestly, I would've been really happy just staying in engineering. I've always loved design too. I think I would've been really happy as a designer. I think no matter what though, I would have been still building something, whether if it was houses or cars or whatever. I like building things.

Lenny (01:23:13):
I love that. You're essentially a one man triad team in this dream. Marty, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. We covered so much stuff. I think we're going to help a lot of people transform. Two final questions, where can folks find your book? When is it available? Where can they reach out if they want to follow up on stuff? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:23:34):
The book should be available worldwide in electronic Kindle audio and hardback on March 12th. We'll see, but that's what the publishers promise. And you can find about all of the things I talk about and all our stuff is for free on the website, svpg.com, Silicon Valley Product Group. And if you don't know at least one of the partners, you should try to meet one. We all love meeting the community and I think you'll enjoy it. So hopefully that's useful.

Lenny (01:24:12):
We've had two partners so far. We'll work our way through the rest over time. And I want to make sure you answer the last question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Marty Cagan (01:24:20):
To be honest, a lot of the inspiration for what we write comes from questions from people, and so we love it when people read something and if it works, great, and they tell us, we love that too. But if they have follow-up questions, one of the nice things about the online archive is we'll just go update the article to address the question. So we love that.

Lenny (01:24:40):
You do the same thing.

Marty Cagan (01:24:41):
So feel free.

Lenny (01:24:42):
All right. Amazing. Marty, thank you so much for making time to do this and for being here.

Marty Cagan (01:24:47):

# How to speak more confidently and persuasively | Matt Abrahams (professor, speaker, author)

## Transcript

Matt Abrahams (00:00:00):
Visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking, but getting up to the stage, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time, and there's good research to say that this desensitizes people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
Most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk.

Matt Abrahams (00:00:20):
You actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:00:34):
Strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just answer the question. Just give the feedback. Just be engaged in the small talk. By doing that, you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Matt Abrahams. Matt is a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business where he teaches a very popular class on communication and public speaking. He's also the host of the incredibly popular podcast, Think Fast, Talk Smart; and the author of the very popular book, Think Faster and Talk Smarter. Matt also coaches people one-on-one on public speaking and communication skills. And in our conversation we focus on the two areas that people most need help with. One, reducing their anxiety before and during any form of public speaking, and getting better at speaking on the spot, including giving better toasts, giving feedback, doing Q&A, and even apologizing.

(00:01:36):
Like we talk about in the actual conversation, speaking well is a superpower in your career for interviewing, for being great in meetings, for pitching your manager on ideas, to leading teams. And the skill becomes even more important as you grow in your career. The good news is that you can get better at it with a bit of help. I've worked on this a lot over the course of my career and I still get really nervous before big talks and even before every podcast episode, but many of these techniques I actually put into practice and I share that in our conversation. If you pick just a couple things from this episode to put into practice, you'll become a better communicator, you'll be less nervous, and you'll get better at dealing with on-the-spot moments.

This episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights hub for product teams. Are you working in a feature factory building filler that nobody wants? Probably, because the sad truth is that most SaaS features are rarely or never used, costing the industry billions every year. Let's change that. Product managers, Dovetail is holding their first industry conference, it's called Insight Out, and they want you to come. Over one day in San Francisco, the product community is coming together to learn how to better leverage customer insights and build products that people actually love to use. It's on April 11, and you can hear from product leaders from Uber, Twitch, Meta and Netflix, as they share their strategies for driving innovation, thriving in uncertainty, and balancing customer-centered work with business needs. And here's the kicker, it's absolutely free for online tickets. Just go to dovetail.com/lenny to register. This is thanks to Dovetail, the best way for product teams to get the most out of customer insights. Check it out at dovetail.com/lenny.

(00:04:50):
Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:04:54):
Lenny, I am excited for our conversation and thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
Thank you for being here. I'm even more excited for the conversation. So what I want to do with our time today is there's two areas I want to focus. One is talking about techniques to help people manage anxiety when public speaking. And two is helping people get better at speaking on the spot, which you wrote a whole book about. And if you think about it, I think that's like most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk. It's usually like you said, Q&A or a or toast someone wants to give you or ask for feedback or things like that. So I'm excited to dig into those things. How do that sound broadly?

Matt Abrahams (00:05:33):
Absolutely, I look forward to that and those are topics I'm very excited to talk about, have done a lot of research in and look forward to sharing more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):
I suspected as much. Okay, so let's talk about anxiety. You have a bunch of really novel techniques in your book and your podcast for calming your body down, calming your mind down when you're planning to give a talk, when you're actually about to give a talk, when you're giving a talk. And a lot of these I haven't actually seen anywhere else and I've used a few of them and they are really great. So what I was thinking we'd do is let me go through the ones that I found most useful and interesting and just share your advice on those and then see if there's any I missed and then maybe add those at the end. How's that?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:15):
That sounds great. That sounds great. I love that you've applied some of these techniques and found value from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:19):
I'll talk about this, I'll talk about this. Okay, first of all, just to catch on this, you're not a fan of the picture people in your audience naked approach, correct?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:27):
The Brady Bunch advice is not good advice. I don't know about you and I don't know anybody who could imagine seeing a bunch of people in their underwear and feel more comfortable with that. And I think if you do, there are other issues you need to be dealing with than beyond speaking anxiety.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:42):
Yeah, it feels like highly inappropriate now, just that idea, trying to picture everyone-

Matt Abrahams (00:06:46):
No, but underlying that if you'll give me a moment, there is some value. This notion of visualization as a tool of desensitization actually can be very helpful, but you're not visualizing the audience half naked. What you're doing is you're visualizing yourself in that space. You're visualizing the audience responding to you and what you're saying. So just like a pilot might do a flight simulator, having a visualization can actually really help you feel more comfortable and confident. It literally puts you in the room even though you're not there. And there's some tools and I'm fascinated by these tools that are virtual reality tools that can also serve to desensitize you. So this notion of seeing your audience in advance of actually speaking can actually impact your level of comfort. It's let's keep everybody clothed and let's keep them all focused on your topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
Well, let's actually talk about this one while we're on it because I think this is a really powerful technique. An idea just to kind of summarize, you picture ahead of time, what it's going to look like and feel like. You talking, looking at the audience. You talk about that and just how to go about using that technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:07:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And this is some of the oldest research on public speaking anxiety. It was research done in the '80s from the University of Oregon. So visualization, what it does is it allows you to see the event in a way that you have much more control over it so you can think about it. So a good visualization involves some deep breathing to calm yourself. Either you close your eyes or you just look at a picture. Maybe you can get a picture of the environment you're speaking in. I often recommend speakers see the room even if they're not physically present, but get a picture online or some way envision yourself in the room, envision yourself in the room with the people you'll be speaking to. Often we know the individuals or some of them. We can also go online and figure out who they are.

(00:08:39):
So visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking but getting up to the stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. And by taking yourself through that you in essence are a dress rehearsal even though you're not physically in the room. And there's good research to say that this desensitizes people. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time where they'll do visualization to help them and it really does work. And like I said, there are virtual tools now that can help you do this where you can actually program it to have a certain size audience. You can even program some of these to have a responsive audience or a distracted audience. All of this in service of just preparing you for what you're really going to see.

(00:09:25):
And the bottom line is this, what you're doing for yourself is making sure it's not new and novel. It's something been there, done that, even though if it was virtual or visualized in your mind, to help you feel better about the circumstance. It gives you a sense of agency.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):
I've done this myself actually. I gave a TEDx talk once and it was probably the scariest talk I've ever given and I spent a lot of time doing this and it doesn't actually have to take that much time. It could be like a five-minute thing where you sit down, calm yourself, and then just picture the stuff. And ideally you do it a couple times, I imagine.

Matt Abrahams (00:09:57):
That's right. Good for you. And congratulations on giving a TEDx talk. That is a high-stakes talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
Thank you. That was before TEDx became super uncool. It was still pretty early. It's out there in the internet in case people want to find it.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:09):
Don't say they're uncool. I'm doing one in two weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:11):
They're so cool. That is, they are cool.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:13):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):
They're incredible. I'm impressed.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:17):
I've done a number of them and I've coached many people and I think that there's a lot of value that they can provide people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
There is. There is. I think they've just become slightly less cool because now there's a lot of them, but they're still incredibly cool, I'm very proud.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:29):
Okay, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):
So on the visualization piece, I think we have a lot of techniques, but just on this one, part of it is continue to calm yourself as you're doing it. I think that's really important because you want to help your body not connect to the stress that you're feeling like you're going to experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:46):
That's correct. Any distance you can give yourself from the anxiety that you're feeling is helpful and there are lots of techniques that help give you a little bit of distance and visualization is one of those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:57):
One of my favorite techniques that it might be in this bucket, it might be on the spot advice bucket, but I think it works great here is what you call dare to be dull. Can you talk about that because I love that?

Matt Abrahams (00:11:09):
Yeah. I really leaned into this with the spontaneous speaking work that I've been doing as of late, but it applies to anybody speaking. This is a notion that comes from the world of improvisation and when people hear improv, they often think of standup comedy, having to be funny. And that's not what improv is all about. Improv is all about being present, being collaborative, being open, and it's a wonderful tool just to help you get present oriented. Think of it as like meditation in action, but also it teaches lots of valuable skills for communication.

(00:11:42):
When we communicate, especially spontaneously, we want to do it really well. We want to answer the question with the best answer, we want to give the right feedback, we want to be the most interesting in small talk and that puts a lot of pressure on ourselves. And you can think of it this way, it's really taxing our cognitive bandwidth.

(00:12:04):
Your brain in many ways is like a CPU, a computer. It's not a perfect analogy, but it works. And if I am constantly judging and evaluating everything I am saying against some standard of perfection, whatever that is, it means I have a limited amount of bandwidth to focus on what I'm actually saying and connecting to my audience. If you have a laptop or a phone that has lots of windows and apps open, each one of those is performing less well because of the other ones being open. So I often say strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just get the task done, just answer the question, just give the feedback, just be engaged in the small talk. And by doing that you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed. So dare to be dull is all about giving yourself permission to just be present and do what's needed. And when you do that you find that you actually do quite a good job at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
The last point I think is really important, you talk about this in your book. Is when you start with, "Okay, I'm just going to say something, it'll be fine." Without that pressure, you end up saying something better and more interesting and more insightful because you're less nervous about it.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:16):
That's exactly right. We are often our biggest impediments to good communication because of the anxiety we bring to the party.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
That's awesome. And I think this can apply to prepared talks too. When you're preparing a deck, don't put this pressure on yourself, "This has to be the best talk ever." Just like, "I'm going to do my best. Let me just start with something that's good enough." People learn something and then from that, their editing ends up leading to something great in my experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:39):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:40):
Awesome. Okay, let's go to the next technique, and this is another one I've practiced and another guest on the podcast actually suggested this and these two remind me of using this one, which is to tell yourself when you're going to be giving a talk. "I'm excited. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'm so excited to give this talk." And reframe it from, "I'm nervous," to like, "No, I'm excited. This is going to be amazing." Can you talk about that technique?

Matt Abrahams (00:14:04):
Absolutely. So this is one of many cognitive reframing techniques. It is often attributed to my friend and colleague, Alison Wood Brooks, she's at Harvard Business School who did some research into this. And what she found is...

(00:14:18):
Well, first take a step back. When you get physically aroused by anxiety, you're under that fight or flight threat response. It turns out that same response happens to your body when you're excited. The human body has pretty much just one arousal response. Our heart beats faster, we breathe more shallow, we get a little shaky, but the big difference is how we label that. So if I say, "Hey Lenny, guess what? Your colleague couldn't show up today and you need to go teach the class or you need to go give that presentation." You might feel your heart rate go up, get a little shaky, sweat on your brow and you're seeing that as negative. But if I said, "Hey Lenny, guess what? You just won the lottery." Same physiological response would happen, but you would see that likely as more positive.

(00:15:06):
So how we label the arousal matters and what Alison's research and others have followed up with suggests is that when we feel those symptoms of anxiety, rather than seeing it as negative, say, "This is exciting. I get to share my point of view. I get to demonstrate my value." And in so doing by seeing it as more positive, it causes us by definition to relax. And her research fascinatingly found that people actually were perceived as communicating better. And again that's because that pressure was taken off of them. So I challenge everybody to think about what are the exciting elements of the communication opportunities you have and really lean into those. And when you feel those anxiety symptoms, remind yourself these are signs of excitement. This is me being excited about sharing this information and it can really help.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
This is another one I've done and it super works. It sounds so trivial and so like, "Why would this do anything?" But I find you just say that just like, "I'm going to have so much fun. This is going to be exciting." It does make an impact. So another one to try, even though it sounds really trivial.

(00:16:12):
Kind of along these lines, there's another technique you recommend which is a mantra, having a mantra that you repeat to yourself. I don't know if it's kind of the same general idea, but you have a couple mantras that you recommend to people like "I have value to add" and things like that. What advice do you have there?

Matt Abrahams (00:16:27):
Yes, thank you. And that's mine. The one that you shared is, "I have value to add." So if we were to really listen to the voice in our heads when it comes to communication, we say a lot of negative things to ourselves. We say things like, "I'm not prepared. I'm not going to be as good as this person. I'm an imposter." We carry around with us a lot of this chatter that actually sets us up to not do well or to be more nervous. So if we can actually change that talk track, it can help us.

(00:17:01):
I'm not saying you have to go to an extreme and say, "I'm going to be the best communicator ever." Rather you can simply say as I do and as you alluded to. What I'll say right before I speak is, "I have value to bring."

(00:17:12):
Often when we are in communicative situations, especially at work, people want to hear from us. We've been invited to speak, we're on the agenda for the meeting. There is value people can take from our communication and we just have to remind ourselves of that. So having some little mantra that you can say that's not over the top but just makes sense. It could be as simple as you've got this, or I'm prepared, or I know my stuff. And I actually encourage people to write it on a post-it note if you're old school, sometimes people put it into their phones as a reminder. So like a minute or two minutes before they're set to give the presentation or participate in the meeting, it flashes up. We just have to turn off or turn down the noise of that internal negative self-talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
What are some other mantras that you found helpful or that people use?

Matt Abrahams (00:18:03):
They're very personal to different people. I was just coaching a senior leader the other day who his mantra was, "Last time this went well." He's a leader, he does a lot of the same presentations and just by saying last time this went well, reminds him that it's likely to go well this time. We are very susceptible to catastrophizing when we're very nervous about things, especially when we're exposed in front of people. Not in the Brady Bunch exposure we talked about earlier, but when we're out there speaking or communicating and simply reminding ourselves that often they go very well is helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):
Yeah. There's another one that I think you shared which is, "It's not about me, it's about my content."

Matt Abrahams (00:18:41):
Yes, exactly. That's another one. That's a great one. It can be very helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
The one you shared about, "I've got this," reminds me, my wife took a course with the Artist's Way writer, Julia Cameron I think is her name. And she has this piece of advice where you name your critic, your inner critic that's always telling you to stop doing stuff. You name him or her. So I name mine Jim. And then when he or she is giving you things you don't want to hear, you're just like, "Jim, I got this. Jim, I don't need this advice."

Matt Abrahams (00:19:11):
There is a lot of evidence on personifying the things that challenge us and then having conversations with it. It's a way of rationalizing some of the things that we do that are quite negative. So something there for sure to be thinking about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:30):
There we go. Bonus advice. That was-

Matt Abrahams (00:19:32):
Bonus advice, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
I didn't expect that.

Matt Abrahams (00:19:34):
And the cool thing that what you're highlighting is there is a lot of advice out there on how to manage anxiety. Many of us feel like we're the only people who feel this nervous because we see our colleagues, our friends or Ted talks as you were talking about, and we see these people communicating just so effortlessly. Often a lot of work went into that and we don't see that work. And sometimes just knowing that others experience it makes us feel better.

(00:19:58):
If you'll allow me, I'll tell this very quick story. I was in the San Francisco Airport, this was several years ago after my Speaking Up Without Freaking Out book came out, and my name was called over the PA system at the airport counter. The seat that I was supposed to sit in was broken and they wanted to talk to me about it. So when I came away from that, somebody came up to me and said, "Hey, you're the guy that wrote that book on speaking anxiety." I said, "Yes." And I said, "What do you know about it?" He goes, "Oh, I bought the book." I said, "Oh, was it helpful?" He says, "Incredibly helpful, but I didn't read it." I'm like, "This is weird. So you're telling me the book was helpful and you didn't read it?" And so I said, "Tell me more." And he said, "Just knowing that a book like that existed made me feel better because I don't know you and I know you certainly didn't write the book for me. So it implies that lots of people have this issue."

(00:20:44):
And just by normalizing the anxiety, which by the way is the normal condition. Those of us who study this believe it is innate to being human to feel nervous communicating in front of others. So sometimes just reminding yourself that you're not alone and that others have it can actually help reduce the pressure that we feel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
This is such an important point that I am kicking myself for not starting with this also because I think this is something people don't realize. They see all their execs at their company speaking incredibly well, so confidently, so articulately and just like, "Oh my God, how will I ever be someone like that?" Is there anything more you can share of just like you have tons of students that go through your class, you see these issues, they're more transparent, you think about their challenges, I imagine. Is there anything more you could share there to help people feel better? Like this is most people, even when you see someone amazing at speaking, they are also probably nervous.

Matt Abrahams (00:21:36):
With regard to that, I think we just need to talk about it more. We need to share about it. I mean, I always will share that I still have anxiety in speaking in certain situations and it's something that's taken me a long time to work on. I also help people understand that it's not a light switch. It's not like you either have it or you don't. It's a process. And so the idea is over time, we will feel less nervous if we apply some of these principles you and I are talking about.

(00:22:01):
A great technique to help people that often isn't talked about is many of us feel much more comfortable in conversation than we do in presenting. And conversation is a back and forth. So you can actually set up a lot of your communication situations, a presentation, a meeting, et cetera, as conversations. And you don't even have to have a conversation with the audience. You can simply have it with yourself. For example, what would it be like if you were to start a presentation by saying, "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is..." And you state the question and then you answer it. I am actually having a conversation with myself in that moment where I am asking myself a question. I happen to know the answer, I give the answer. This again, just like the reframing as excitement versus anxiety, this is a reframe. I'm not presenting, I'm having a conversation. And in so doing it ratchets down that anxiety.

(00:22:53):
So we need to talk about it. We need to share our experiences with developing anxiety management plans. We realize it's not binary, it's not I have it or I don't. And we start seeing where we feel more comfortable and how can we bring that comfort level into the types of situations that make us nervous, like simply having a conversation with yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:13):
You have another technique I think that's different, maybe it's exactly the same, which is to ask a question of somebody else as you're talking, which is I think deflects attention from you. Can you talk about that?

Matt Abrahams (00:23:22):
Yeah. So we talked about the way we desensitize through visualization. The other thing we can do is distract.

(00:23:30):
I coached a very senior leader at Google who got very nervous when he was up in front of people, and what we did is we distract his audience. So he would start every single presentation saying these words, "Good morning, let's watch this video." And he'd show a 30-second video that was on topic about something they were going to talk about in the meeting. And when the video stopped, he would then facilitate a discussion of what that video was about and then he would ease into his content. So he went from being a presenter to being a facilitator or somebody who was having a conversation with the audience. That made him feel so much better.

(00:24:05):
And so all of us can do things that can distract our audience. Now when I say distract, I don't mean take them on a tangent that's not relevant to what you're saying, but maybe you ask them a question, maybe you tell them a story, maybe you show them a video or ask them to read something. So there are lots of things that you can do that will help get the attention off you for just a little bit so that you can then focus on what works for you or take that deep breath that'll help calm you down. All of these are very useful techniques.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:35):
Yeah, it's interesting once you start talking, it's okay usually. It's the beginning part that you need [inaudible 00:24:40].

Matt Abrahams (00:24:40):
Yeah, most people are most nervous one minute before speaking and the first minute of speaking. And if you can find ways to get yourself through that, then it becomes much easier for most people. There are some people who that's not true for, but for most people that's the way it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):
Awesome. Okay, next technique that actually another guest mentioned, and we spent a bunch of time on this, a guest named Johnny Miller, which is a breathing technique. And just to give a little context from what he taught us is that 80% of our neurons go from our body to our brain versus 20% is our brain telling our body what to feel. And so this research shows that what our body's feeling is what our brain's going to think. So if our body's acting nervous, we're going to think, oh, we're nervous. And if you change the state of your body, your mind feels different.

Matt Abrahams (00:25:23):
I love this stuff. This research, embodied cognition is what it's called, is fascinating to me. I'll share one of my most favorite studies in this. There was a researcher at Duke, I think it was Duke, who... The only experimental variation that he did is he had people hold something that was cold in their hand, like an iced coffee versus a warm coffee. And then he asked the participants to make ratings of people. And if you were holding something cold, you saw the person as a colder person, as more aloof and more distant, and if you were holding something warm, you saw them as more collaborative and embracing. I find this stuff fascinating. What our body feels, our minds think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
Awesome. So along those lines, there's a technique that you recommend that he recommended, but I think it's a great reminder of the double exhale where you breathe in and then you exhale twice as long. Can you talk about that and tell people about it?

Matt Abrahams (00:26:13):
Yeah. Breathing is very helpful in managing so many of our anxiety symptoms. It slows down the heart rate, makes our voice sound more normal because when we get nervous, we breathe shallow and that changes... Our voice is a wind instrument, it changes the way we sound, can reduce some of the shakiness. So deep belly breathing, the kind you do if you've ever done yoga or tai chi, qigong, really important to do and there are a whole bunch of variations on it. The one you're talking about is the double inhalation where you're taking an inhale in until you feel completely full and then you sneak in a little extra air and then you take a long exhale. People call it box breathing and other types of breathing.

(00:26:54):
The bottom line is this, what's critical to the relaxation response is the exhale. Lots of ways to inhale, lots of ways to exhale. You want your exhale to be longer than the inhale. The magic of the relaxation happens during the exhale. So I have a rule of thumb, I jokingly call it a rule of lung. You want your exhale to be twice as long as your inhale. So if you take a three count in, even if you sneak in a little extra air as we were talking about, take a six count out. And it is that way that you will feel... Not only will your body physiologically feel less stress, you'll be more focused in a present moment and not catastrophizing about all the things that might happen in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:36):
Great. Yeah, so it's like another example of this sounds so trivial and why would breathing differently do have any impact on my nervousness? But one, there's all this research that shows that it does, and two, if you try it, and this is another one I use, is it actually works very quickly and you do it a few times and like, wow, I feel really different.

Matt Abrahams (00:27:54):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:55):
It is interesting you put these together. From the way I've seen it, these are two different techniques, but I've never tried them together. One is... I think Huberman is big on this one. All his clips are always talking about this. One of you inhale fully and then you inhale a little bit more and there's some capillaries or something in your lungs that fill up that-

Matt Abrahams (00:28:12):
[inaudible 00:28:12]. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:13):
And then there's the 4, 4, 8 is the way this other guest shared is like breathe in four seconds, hold it four seconds, breathe out for eight seconds. But I'm going to try both. Wow. That's going to double up my calmness.

Matt Abrahams (00:28:27):
You'll be so mellow, nothing will bother you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:29):
So mellow. Okay. Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:28:39):
Well, so the first book had 50 techniques and not all 50 techniques work for everybody. One that I personally think is a lot of fun is getting present oriented because when I'm in the present, by definition I'm not worried about the future. And many of our anxiety comes from our fear of a potential negative future outcome like, "I'm not going to achieve my goal." So if I can do anything to be in the present moment, that helps me out a lot.

(00:29:02):
Something I do as part of my personal anxiety management plan is I say tongue twisters. Tongue twisters for me are a great way to get present oriented. You can't say it right if you don't say the tongue twister if you're not focused on the present moment. And it also warms up your voice. A lot of nervous speakers get so inside their head that they don't warm up their voice. And we all know if you've ever done any exercise or competed in any sports, you should warm up first. We have this mistaken notion that we can go from silence to brilliance without warming up. And I like saying tongue twisters out loud to get present oriented and to warm up my voice. So that's one that I often recommend. People think it's silly, but I have people who are like, that really works. It really helps me to get centered and to warm up. And so I like that one a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):
Well, let's share a couple of tongue twisters. What are some recommendations?

Matt Abrahams (00:29:50):
I will only share my tongue twister, I say Lenny, if you promise to say it after me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Absolutely. I'm so ready.

Matt Abrahams (00:29:55):
This is my favorite tongue twister. It takes five seconds to say, it's three phrases long. And if you say it wrong, you say a naughty word. So I'm going to be listening as for all your listeners. So are you prepared? So it goes as follows, I slit a sheet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):
I slit a sheet.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:11):
A sheet I slit

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):
A sheet I slit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:14):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:18):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:20):
Very good. You didn't say that naughty word. I'm sure you can imagine what it would've been.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
A lot of danger, a lot of [inaudible 00:30:26].

Matt Abrahams (00:30:26):
A lot of danger. But in that moment you weren't thinking about, what's the next question I'm going to ask Matt? Or how much longer do we have in the podcast? No, you were simply focused on what we were saying and trying to say it without saying a naughty word. So that's that [inaudible 00:30:39]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:38):
And not have to censor this podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:42):
I've only had to bleep one guest in all my years of doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:46):
Okay, cool. We're going to link to that. Is there any other ones you want to share before we move on to getting better at speaking on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (00:30:52):
Well, the last one I'll say is, and this one is another one that falls in the kind of funny category, but there's research that says that when you swear, curse, it actually helps you reduce anxiety. When you curse, you release a flood of neurochemicals that blunt out the neurochemicals associated with anxiety, cortisol being a big one. So you get a big dopamine hit, for example, serotonin when you swear. So I'm not saying get up on stage and drop an F-bomb, but my students love this. I mean, it's like, "Matt's giving me permission to swear." And no, that's not what I'm doing, but it's an interesting technique that seems to help some people is to curse not necessarily in front of people, but that can help. And it also has an analgesic effect. It actually reduces pain as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):
That's interesting. I could see during birth women screaming curse words.

Matt Abrahams (00:31:48):
Yeah. Well, I'm not going to say what I heard when my kids were born, but...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
But again, this could double up with the tongue twister where you just go for it and say-

Matt Abrahams (00:31:58):
Yeah, every tongue twister has to start with Nantucket and then we're good.

(00:33:34):
Okay, let's shift to talking about talking on the spot.

Matt Abrahams (00:33:39):
I see you said shift very carefully. I appreciate that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):
Now we're going to be so, so careful, I don't want this podcast flagged and for adults only. Okay, shift to a new topic. You have a whole book about how to get better speaking on the spot. And I think why this is important is again, what I said at the beginning that I think most of our "public speaking" is not planned public speaking. There's people asking for feedback in a meeting, people wanting you to give a toast, Q&A as we talked about. So what I want to do is you have advice for broadly getting better at these things and then you have advice for very specifically how to get better at giving better toast, doing better Q&A, getting better at small talk and things like that. So I want to start with the broad advice and then get into each of these. That sound good?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:27):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):
How about you share your favorite techniques for broadly getting better at speaking on the spot, and then we'll see where that goes?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:37):
Sure. So the first thing in helping yourself feel better, speaking spontaneously, which is the vast majority of our communication, the plan presenting, the practiced pitch, the meeting with agenda pale in comparison to the times that we are spontaneously speaking. And the first thing that is important for everybody to know is we can all get better at it. That's the fundamental bottom line. Many of us feel like we're either born with the gift of gab or we're not. And so the first thing we have to realize is we can get better at it.

(00:35:08):
The second big point to make is you actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but it is through preparation that we get better at it. And if you think about it, if you think about an athlete, when an athlete is doing their sport, they are being spontaneous, they are responding to the conditions that present themselves to them. What helps them do well is all the preparation and practice that they've done. So there are lots of analogs to this, but when we think about it in of communication, it seems foreign, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice. Those are the two big underlying principles to helping people get better.

(00:35:48):
The next level has to do with we have to attack both mindset and approach and the actual messaging itself. The only way I have found to help people get better at this is to look at how we approach it, our mindset, and then how we actually craft the messages through structure and focus that help us be better. So that's the gradual process from the broadest level about how we have to go about making this better for ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Maybe let's dig into the structure.

Matt Abrahams (00:36:17):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:17):
What is your advice for how to think about structuring if you're on the spot, like, "Oh, shit, how do I share something smart [inaudible 00:36:22]?"

Matt Abrahams (00:36:22):
See, the bad word came out, so you're ready for my tongue twister. So structure is critical. In spontaneous speaking, most of us, because we feel the intense pressure, the anxiety we just talked about, we just spew out information, we list and itemize information. We take our audience on the journey of our own discovery of what we want to say as we're saying it, and our brains are not wired for lists of information. In fact, Lenny, how many items do you need to buy from the grocery store before you actually have to physically write it down? For me it's four. Anything over four, I'm going to forget something. Our brains aren't wired for lists, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
Yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:03):
And so-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
I text myself.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:05):
Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah, no, I'm old school. I actually put it on a piece of paper, but the point is that we're not wired that way. Our brains are actually wired for story, for connection, a logical connection of ideas. So it's about connecting those pieces together. So a structure is nothing more than a beginning, a middle, and an end. A package of information. The structure that almost everybody listening in is familiar with is one that comes from the world of advertising. Most advertisements are set up as problem, solution, benefit. There's some problem in the world, here's how we solve it with our product or service, and here's how you benefit from it. That's a structure. It's a logical beginning, middle, and end. These items have a connection. So by finding a structure that you can rely on when put on the spot, it halves your burden.

(00:37:54):
When you're put on the spot, you have to think about what to say and how to say it. The structure tells you how to say it, and then you just have to think about what to put into it. So it's like having a recipe. If I have a recipe and I have good ingredients, I can cook a good meal. So there are lots of structures.

(00:38:10):
The whole second part of the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is specific structures for specific situations, introducing yourself, making an apology, giving feedback. And I'm not saying every time you give an apology or give feedback that you have to follow these structures. It just gives you a place to go when you're in that moment where you're like, "Where do I go? How do I start?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):
Cool. So we're going to talk about those examples. One of the structures that I liked that I wrote down is called prep, which is make your point, give a reason for making that point, give an example. And then what's the last one point again?

Matt Abrahams (00:38:47):
Yeah, restate your point. Review it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:48):
Restate your point. That feels like something that say in product teams can come up a lot is just like, here's what I think, here's why. Here's an example and then let me just remind you again what the point I'm making.

Matt Abrahams (00:38:57):
That's right. Yes. I love prep and the structure I really like is a three-question structure: What? So what? Now what? And people on product teams I think could benefit so much from this. What is your product, your service, your offering, your update, your feedback? It's the what of why you're speaking. The so what is why is this important and relevant to the people you're talking to or to your company or to prospective clients? And then the now what is what comes next. So on a product team, if you're describing a feature, here's what the feature is, here's why it's important, and here's what we're doing about it. If you're giving an update in an update meeting, a standup that you're having, here's what I'm working on, here's why it's important, here's what I'm doing next.

(00:39:41):
By packaging the information up in what, so what, now what, it becomes much more digestible, much more memorable. Just like prep. Prep works really well for a point you're making. What, so what, now what works really well for a broader presentation, update, feedback session that you're giving. So having a whole series of these tools in your toolkit can really make a difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
So we've talked about three structures so far. What, so what, now what; prep, which is make the point, give a reason example, and then restate the point; and then problem, solution benefit. So people listening to this it's like, "Oh, amazing, all these structures are great." Do you have any advice on how to remember these? You're like, "Oh, Matt, what do you think of this design?" Like, "Oh, shit, which one should I go with?"

Matt Abrahams (00:40:28):
I try to give each structure a catchy name. What, so what, now what rolls off the tongue. There's a structure in the book for giving feedback called 4Is for Apologizing AAA. So part of it is just coming up with a mnemonic that works for you and you can name them whatever you want, but really the way to get familiar with them and to have them at the ready is to use them.

(00:40:48):
When I coach people on what, so what, now what, I encourage them at the end of a podcast they listen to or something they read, take a moment and say, "What was it about? Why is it important to me and what can I do with that information?" And if you do that, not only do you get better and more comfortable deploying that structure, but you also remember the material better because there's a whole bunch of research that says when we interrogate the material that we listen to or read, we digest it and remember it more. So in 30 seconds you're really helping yourself at least in two ways by getting the structure down and remembering more. So you have to put it into practice.

(00:41:24):
The other way to do it in which we do a lot in my classroom is we have people dissect communication. So you listen to somebody or you see it and you say, what structure did they use? So it's about awareness building and then actually getting the reps. The only way you get better at communication, spontaneous or planned, is the way you get better at anything. Repetition, reflection, and feedback. You got to practice, you got to think about what worked or what didn't, and then you have to get feedback from others. We are not always the best judges of our communication. And in so doing, repetition, reflection and feedback takes your communication to the next level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
That's a lot of work, Matt. That's a lot of work.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:02):
It is work. There is no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:04):
Got you.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:05):
But that's true with most things in life that are really important. There's no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
That's right. That's right. As people are thinking about this and listening to this, there's your course, obviously that you teach at Stanford and only Stanford students can take that. There's your book obviously. Is there anything else? If there's nothing, that's totally fine, that you point people to to actually practice these outside of the workplace? Are there courses that anyone can take that you recommend? Anything else you can point people to?

Matt Abrahams (00:42:31):
Absolutely. There are a lot of resources out there. One, I'm a huge proponent and a former member of Toastmasters. I think Toastmasters is a wonderful organization designed primarily to give you the reps. They do some teaching, but it's really to give you the reps. So I highly recommend Toastmasters.

(00:42:48):
Improvisation is another way to get comfortable with these skills. When people hear improv, they think, "Oh, I got to be funny and it's about performing," and it's not. Improv is really just about being more comfortable, being present, and really focusing on collaborating with others.

(00:43:04):
And then there are courses. You mentioned obviously that people have to be MBA students to take my MBA class, but Stanford and other institutions have continuing studies classes or extension classes that are open to the community. So I, every quarter teach a class that's open to anybody who registers all over the world. It's virtual. I have students this very quarter who take a class on a Monday night Pacific Time, 7:00 PM. I've got somebody in Egypt, I have somebody in China. So there are ways to take advantage of things happening at universities without being an enrolled student. So I would point people to all of those. And then clearly listening to podcasts, reading books, checking out blogs and videos can be really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:44):
I think to your point, it's like you can read about this and listen to podcasts all you want, but you're not going to actually get that much better. And with your course, I imagine there's practice you're doing as a part of the course.

Matt Abrahams (00:43:53):
Everything is applied. The only way to get better at communication is to do communication, to watch communication. And that's why in the books I write, I have this, try this. It's literally put the book down, go do this and then come back because that's how you learn communication. And so yes, any avenue to help you get the reps is going to be helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
I'll be honest, I did none of the try this. I'm just like, that's too much work. So I think that's why it's important to take something where you have to do it because it's too easy just like, yeah, yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:24):
Yeah. You're not the first person to say that they don't take the time to do that. There are others who say they really appreciate that. And for people such as yourself, at the very end of my book, I have a QR code that takes you to a bunch of videos. So if you don't want to do it yourself, you can actually watch people do it or watch me do it. And so that's at least better than not doing any of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):
Awesome. I'll also give a shout-out to Toastmasters. I did Toastmasters for a while and two things there. One is there's a special focus on the spot speaking that's a part of the sequence.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:56):
They call them table topics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):
Table topics, yeah. And that's like a 60-second, someone gets up and just has to talk on something. So it's a big part of that method. Also, I did it for a long time and all I did was I was the counter or the timer. You can do it without having to give any talks for as long as you want. And it's very cheap and they're everywhere. There's a local chapter wherever you are.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:17):
Absolutely. And many companies sponsor their own Toastmasters groups, so that's great. And they are very good at easing people into it. You're not forced to do anything. And the same is with improv. A good improv teacher never forces anybody to do anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):
Great. We went way off-topic, but let's get back to the agenda at hand, which is let's talk about specific situations and advice you have for getting better at these. So maybe we start with small talk and there's one that I love and I find so important and so subtle, which is have comparable levels of disclosure. And the question basically is how do we get better at small talk? And here's one technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:55):
Yeah, so let me get to that point in a second because that's a more refined point than some general principles. When it comes to small talk, many people dread small talk, they feel really awkward about it. I think small talk has a bad reputation, needs to be rebranded. I think a lot of big things happen in small talk. We learn about ourselves and others. We form and foster relationships. I challenge everybody listening to think about some of their friends, our closest friends. How did you meet them? Probably some component of small talk played a role, especially early in those relationships. So it does good things for us.

(00:46:32):
The best advice I have ever heard for small talk came from a guest on my podcast. Her name's Rachel Greenwald. She's an interesting person. She's an academic and a matchmaker, really fascinating. And her advice was this: Be interested, not interesting. Many of us go into small talk thinking we have to be super interesting. We have to spike the ball over the net every time. When in fact small talk is more like playing the game of Hacky Sack, where it's simply just set the other person up to be successful and get the ball back to you. So if we go in with that mindset, it makes it easier.

(00:47:06):
Now there's some rules that we can follow. One rule is the one that you shared that in small talk there should be a balance of disclosure or depth of disclosure over time. So if you're telling me about the first time your first pet died, and I'm telling you my favorite color is blue, there's a discrepancy in disclosure there. Clearly you've revealed a lot more than I have. And we have this notion of reciprocity that if you share something that is appropriate but is more disclosive, that I should at some point match that level or come close. And if we don't, then it feels very awkward and we feel like we're not jiving in that way.

(00:47:49):
I don't want everybody sitting with a little card that they're checking off, but having that general notion in mind can help. And the trick here is not to be too disclosive too quickly. So if we start small talk and we're talking about the I meeting that we're at, and you immediately jump into the fight you had with your significant other that might lead to divorce, that's a deep and big step that might feel a little inappropriate. But over time, if we continue to disclose, it might be perfectly natural for you to share that. So there's sort of expectations and we just have to be mindful of those.

(00:48:24):
Another thing we need to be mindful of that I think is really important is this distinction between shifting and supporting responses. In a conversation, I can be supportive. That is, you might say, "Hey Matt, I just got back from Costa Rica." I could say, "Oh great, did you spend time in San Jose? Did you get to any of the beaches?" Those are supporting responses. I'm asking you to keep telling me more. A shifting response would be like, "Oh, you went to Costa Rica. I went to Hawaii." And the goal in a good conversation is to have more supporting responses than shifting, but to have some shifting responses. Because if all I do is continually support you, it looks like I don't want to share. I'm not being disclosive at all. So there are these subtle things that we can be aware of to help the conversation go and to breed that intimacy and immediacy that we feel, but it takes a congruence, a balancing of doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
This is awesome. I feel like everyone needs this class to just like, how do I talk to people? What's the right way to talk?

Matt Abrahams (00:49:24):
Well, right. The point that you're bringing up there, Lenny, is we're never taught this stuff and yet we have to do it all the time. And that's why focusing on it I think really matters. And it can really, as you said, superpower, it can be a superpower because so many people don't do this or spend the time getting better at it. We all operate under this notion of... the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. And that's not good for small talk and other communication situations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):
I love this balance you just shared of... So the primary piece of advice for small talk is be interested, not interesting, ask person questions, get excited about what they're telling you. There's a classic book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, which is very much about this. Highly recommend it. It's like very old school now, but there's so much good advice there. There's no better sound to someone's ears than their name. So just saying their name, they're like, "Yeah, I love that." And then just smiling. There's all these very simple things that that book shares. It sounds like you recommend and you're fan of that book, and it's something you've read, right?

Matt Abrahams (00:50:27):
I know the book. Some of that stuff has been true for a long time. Some of the stuff. I'm not a big fan of ingratiation and manipulation. I like authenticity and some of the advice in books like that can sound like smile, nod your head. And all of that can sound a little manipulative and inauthentic, but I think some of those principles are important. And if you can in an authentic, true, appropriate way, leverage some of that, I think it would help you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:57):
Yeah, somebody once shared a story with their kid... Then they're 13. They read that book and it just effed them up for a while because they just started putting these into practice way too young.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:06):
Well, one thing... I mean, all of a sudden you're focusing on... You can get so wrapped up in doing these things that you're actually not connecting. It's like people who travel on a vacation and all they do is take pictures of where they are instead of experiencing where they are. And that's not where we want to be with this advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
But I love this other component of... Because a lot of people hear this advice, ask questions, be interested, be excited, this version of it, but you need to have somewhat equal levels of disclosure is really important. Because I fall into this sometimes where like, "I don't care about myself. I just want to ask you questions. And this is going great, I'm just going to keep asking." And if you're not sharing anything by yourself, it gets really strange. Even when they ask you, you're like, "No, no, let's keep talking about you." You think they want that, but they don't. They actually want to hear about you.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And you do such a lovely job as a podcast... I mean, so podcast host is a great job for you if you like asking questions, but I bet you have found, because I have found this for me as being a host of Think Fast, Talk Smart is that sharing a little bit about your own experience actually makes the conversations go better. And so I think that's a lesson for all of us, and you don't have to have your own podcast to learn that lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:16):
Yeah, I read this book on podcasting interviewing when I first started, and one of the big piece of advice is if you share more about yourself, you'll hear more stories that they can share. They're more vulnerable. Not that I think about that, but that's in my head sometimes.

Matt Abrahams (00:52:29):
Yeah. Well, you do a good job of it, even if it's just intuitive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):
Appreciate it.

(00:52:33):
Let's talk about another version of on-the-spot talking, which is giving feedback. Oftentimes people listening to this podcast, they're asked, what do you think of this design? What do you think of this roadmap? What do you think of the strategy? What are some tips for getting better at on-the-spot feedback?

Matt Abrahams (00:52:48):
First and foremost, we need to look at and define feedback. Feedback to me is an opportunity to problem solve. Certainly there are some behaviors that we absolutely have to shut down. It's inappropriate, it's inexcusable, we have to shut it down. But often feedback is really an opportunity to problem solve. And if you take it as an opportunity to problem solve, then what you're looking for is collaboration with the other person, which means that we have to invite them to join us as we do this. So it's not me bestowing upon you my opinion, it's me inviting you to together work on whatever this issue challenge is that we have. And I am a huge disciple of Kim Scott, Radical Candor. I really like her approach to it. Kim's a friend. She's actually a neighbor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
Well, she's been on the podcast, by the way.

Matt Abrahams (00:53:35):
Oh, great. So you know Kim and your listeners know Kim. Yeah, she's great. Where I think I can add a little value to what Kim talks about, and she does talk about structure, but I think having the structure to package up the information to make it easier to digest by your audience, the person or people you're talking to, but also to formulate your thoughts can help. And we've already talked about one mechanism, one structure for feedback. It's what, so what, now what?

(00:53:59):
So imagine, Lenny, you and I come out of a meeting and you say, "Hey, Matt, how'd that go?" I could say, "I thought the meeting went really well, Lenny, except when you talked about the implementation plan. You spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail." That's my what. "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." That's the so what. "Next time I suggest you slow down and you include these two or three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area." So that's the now what.

(00:54:32):
So that what, so what, now what helps me very quickly structure information and package it in a way that helps me as the giver of the feedback, think through what are the things I need to say? I need to think through what's bothering me, what the consequences are of that behavior, and then what I think you should do.

(00:54:51):
There's a more robust structure I talk about in the book called The 4 Is, and each I stands for something starting with the letter I. But four eyes also like glasses. It helps you see more clearly. So in the 4 I structure, the first I is information. You're just setting the playing field so the person knows what you're giving the feedback about. The second is impact, and this is impact on you, the feedback giver. The third is the invitation that you make, and then the final is the implications or consequences.

(00:55:19):
So imagine I have an employee who doesn't show up to the meetings on time and prepared. I might say, "This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting. I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are. What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project." So information, impact, invitation, and implications. Now, certainly I can vary the tone and the directness of some of those responses so it sounds very differently, but thinking through it in my mind, I have to level set what we're talking about. I have to share why it's important to me at least, make the invitation, and talk about the benefits or consequences. Makes a lot of sense. So there are lots of structures and lots of ways to communicate, especially in feedback. Find one or two that work for you so when you're put on the spot, you can default to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):
Maybe a big takeaway here is pick one of these structures that you want to use when somebody asks you for feedback. And the two you shared are what? So what? Now what? Or these four Is. Give information, show the impact that it had on you, invitation and then implications.

Matt Abrahams (00:56:30):
That's correct, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Okay. Let's talk about another category, which is not a work category, but I suck at toasts and I am always trying to get better at this. And you have a bunch of awesome advice for how to give better toasts. Can you share some stuff?

Matt Abrahams (00:56:45):
Yeah. We have all been victimized by bad toasts. The toast that goes on too long, the toast that's more about the person giving the toast than the event or the person. And when I say toast, I don't just mean at weddings, bar mitzvahs, quinceaneras. We give tributes at work all the time. Congratulations to the team or somebody's anniversary or somebody's retirement. So we give toasts and tributes all the time. In fact, I heard a statistic once that it is the most frequent public speaking event across people is giving toasts and tributes. So we should learn how to do these well.

(00:57:16):
So I have an acronym. It works. It's called WHAT. W-H-A-T. The W stands for why are we here? Now, if I'm at a wedding, I don't have to tell the audience why we're here. We get it. But if we're doing an all hands and I'm called up to speak, it might be in my best interest to share with everybody, I'm here to celebrate the release of this product that that team put out. So you might have to say, why are we here?

(00:57:42):
The H is how are you connected to the event? So if I'm at a wedding, people might not know who I am. I could say, "Hey, I've known the groom for 25 years." And people are like, "Oh, okay. Now that makes sense." If you're giving a tribute at work, you don't have to say, "And I'm the boss." Everybody knows your position. So again, these are choices you make. So why are we here? How are you connected?

(00:58:02):
The A stands for anecdote. Tell a story or a quick example that is relevant and accessible to everybody. There's no insider knowledge and keep it concise.

(00:58:16):
And then ultimately the last part is the gratitude, the thank you. So express gratitude, express some kind of thanks. In a toast at a celebratory event, you might say cheers or whatever's appropriate for the culture you come from to signal closure. But again, why are we here? How are you connected? Anecdote or two, and then the gratitude or thanking at the end. And if you follow that structure, it can navigate, just like a GPS, your way through the toast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
This is such an easy structure to remember. There's so much of it that I love. What I want to understand is where do you put the actual content of the tribute and the toast? Is it the anecdote expands into, "Here's what I want to say?" Like there's an example or story and then it's like-

Matt Abrahams (00:58:59):
Exactly. So it is typically part of that. You might do it as part of the why we're all here. "We're here to really celebrate the Herculean effort of this particular team to get this product launched. I'm so honored to have supported it. I'm the manager of the team. Here's a story about how Lenny worked overtime to get this done. Let's raise our glasses and give them a salute." So yes, you could do it in the why are we here or through the anecdotes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:29):
Okay. And then one of your other piece of advice, which connects to what you just said is be brief.

Matt Abrahams (00:59:33):
Yes, yes. So nobody has ever complained about a toast that's too brief. I'm sure it's possible, but the majority of complaints are the toast went on forever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
Do you find that it would ever make sense to give a couple anecdotes or make a couple points in a toast?

Matt Abrahams (00:59:51):
Yeah, and it depends. Toasts are opportunities for teaching and learning as well, especially in a work environment. So it might make sense to tell a couple anecdotes. I'm a huge fan... I mean, your listeners know, you know minimally viable product design, agile development, really critical. What is it about? It's about understanding your audience, your users, and it's about rapidly prototyping and iterating. I believe in minimally viable communication, trademark pending, where it's the same principles. Know your audience, put together a rough draft of what you want to say, test it out. So if you're going to give a big toast in front of a company all hands, run it by a few people and say, "Is it too many anecdotes? Would it benefit from having another story?" Get people's feedback. We are not the best judges of our communication. So the answer is yes, but test it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
Another element of a great toast that you recommend is to be emotional. Can you touch on that?

Matt Abrahams (01:00:50):
Well, so emotion connects with people, and as long as it's genuine and authentic, it's really important. I've been thinking a lot about emotion and communication. My father recently passed away and everybody in my family said, "Well, Matt's going to do the eulogy." It was like, I had no choice. What do I do? I'm the guy who teaches communication. So I felt added pressure not only to honor my father's life, but everybody's like, "This is the way you do a eulogy." And so I wanted to do some research on what's all the advice out there on eulogies, and there wasn't a lot. So I actually wrote an article on my experience, and hopefully it'll help people. But the point is, in those circumstances where there's a lot of emotion, it's important because it connects to the audience, it makes it human, but sometimes the emotion can get in the way for you as a communicator. I mean, I was very concerned that my emotion would cover up or overshadow the honoring I was trying to do of my father. But the same thing can happen in any kind of toast situation.

(01:01:48):
So think about emotion. Emotion is a tool to use. The best way to convey emotion in a toast is through the anecdotes you use. The anecdotes reveal the emotion. It's one thing to say, "I am so sad." It's another thing to tell a story that is sad.

(01:02:02):
I was very fortunate to interview for my podcast coming up soon, a one-panel cartoonist. So she has to create everything in one panel. And her advice is: Don't tell, show. In that don't tell somebody you're angry, show that you're angry in the panel she writes. So showing the emotion through story and anecdote is the way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:22):
Have you had Matthew Dix on your podcast?

Matt Abrahams (01:02:26):
So it is so funny. I have not, and I want to. His name comes up more than anybody else's. And I know of his work and his advice, so I might ask you to connect me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):
Absolutely. I thought of him as you were talking because he helps people create their eulogy ahead of time before somebody passes away, before you get really emotional and you have to rush it. So that's one of his services is he helps to write eulogies for people.

Matt Abrahams (01:02:50):
Yeah, yeah. No, I'd love an introduction. His work is very influential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Absolutely. He's amazing. We'll link his episode about storytelling.

(01:02:57):
Okay, let me talk about a couple more. Q&A, getting better at question, answer at the end of a talk, whether it's on the spot or not.

Matt Abrahams (01:03:05):
Again, I always start with approach. Many of us see Q&A as threatening or challenging, and in fact, we need to see Q&A as an opportunity. It's an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, learn. Even in the most hostile of situations where people are really coming at you with a lot of spice or hot and heavy, you can get a lot of value out of it. So we have to come to the approaches. These questions are opportunities. We have to make sure that we take the question in without interrupting or over-validating the question.

(01:03:36):
I have two pet peeves about Q&A sessions. One is saying good question to every question. And two, at the end of answering the question saying, "Does that make sense?" Because in both cases, you're trying to validate the asker when you say good question. You're also trying to buy yourself time. And there are other ways to do that. And at the end when you say, "Does that make sense," you've got a laudable goal in mind, which is, "Did I answer your question?" But I'd much rather you say, "Did I answer your question? Can I tell you more? Do you have a follow-up question?"" Because if you keep saying, "does that make sense, does that make sense," people are going to start thinking, "Maybe he doesn't make sense because he is always asking." So some pet peeves there.

(01:04:15):
Once the question comes in and you have to answer it, I have yet another structure. This structure is related to the what, so what, now what structure. It's called ADD for adding value. You answer the question cleanly and concisely. You then give an example to reinforce the answer, and then you explain the relevance or significance of the answer so people know it. Would you mind role-playing an example of this with me, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:43):
Absolutely.

Matt Abrahams (01:04:44):
Okay. Imagine you're hiring me. You're a hiring manager, and I'm interviewing to be what I do for my day job. I'm a lecturer at Stanford's Business School, teach strategic communication. You so happen to have a position open for a strategic communication lecturer. I show up. What is a reasonable question you would ask that doesn't just have a yes no answer?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):
Wait, so you're interviewing for a role to be a lecturer in my school and [inaudible 01:05:11] communication.

Matt Abrahams (01:05:11):
Yes. You're the dean. You get to hire me. What's a reasonable question? I mean, you could ask a super hard one, but I want people to hear how ADD works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):
This might be too simple, but just how many students have you worked with and taught over the years?

Matt Abrahams (01:05:23):
Okay, so I'm going to morph that question because I could just say thousands, which is true, but I'm going to turn it into a question about experience, because really what you're asking me is what's my experience? So because that I can give an ADD answer too. If it's just a numeric answer, just give a number. So I might say, "I've been doing this for 25 years and I have taught over thousands of students. I've taught both in the academic world, but also in the corporate world. What this means is I can tailor my material to be relevant and useful to your students."

(01:05:56):
So I answered the question. The question was, what's your experience? 25 years, thousands of students. I then give an example. I've done this in the corporate world, I've done this in the academic world. So I ground it in something tangible. And then I show the relevance. What this means for you as a dean hiring me, is that I'm going to be able to tailor my experience. We often assume that people can connect the dots. If I give my answer, you're going to see, "Oh, that's why this is relevant and important." But we need to actually connect those dots for our audience.

(01:06:24):
I had a psychology professor once who said, the funny thing about common sense is it's not so common, and we often make the assumption that people will connect the dots. So answer the question, give a detailed example, and then explain the relevance. And if you do that, it will help. And I challenge every one of your listeners working in companies that have FAQs, frequently asked questions, go back to those FAQs and put them in this structure. Not only will it help you digest and get familiar and comfortable with the structure, anybody looking at those answers begins to see that this is a way to give a complete answer. This is how our organization answers questions. And that can be so helpful to building consistency and helping yourself answer better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):
Just to clarify, the acronym is ADD?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:09):
ADD. Answer, detailed example, describe the relevance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):
Describe the relevance. I see how you snuck that D in there.

Matt Abrahams (01:07:16):
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can come up with whatever acronym you want that helps you remember. ADD because it adds value.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
Awesome. Okay. And maybe one last quick one, apologizing. What's a couple tips for getting better at apologizing on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:33):
First and foremost, we need to take the time to apologize. Many of us don't. And when we apologize, we need to make sure that we apologize for the transgression and not for how we made people feel. So often people will simply say, "I'm sorry that you feel bad." Well, that's not an apology. You're not assuming responsibility. So we need to first start by talking about the issue that we are addressing or the problem that we caused somebody. So we need to think about apologies in that way. So an apology to me, I have a AAA, like roadside repair service here in the United States, AAA. It's three steps, acknowledge, appreciate, and amends. So I have to acknowledge what I did.

(01:08:23):
So imagine we're in a meeting and I interrupted you. You were in the midst of speaking and I interrupted you. So I might say, "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke when you were talking." I'm acknowledging what I did.

(01:08:36):
Then I appreciate. "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view." So that's the appreciation.

(01:08:46):
The amends part is, "I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done, and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point." So I'm signaling I understand it, and here's the very specific thing I'm going to do to try to remedy it, which of course you can comment on. You can say, no, I don't think that's enough. I think you whatever, or thank you, I think that's even more than is needed, whatever. So you acknowledge the actual behavior and offense, not how you made the person feel right away. You then express appreciation for the difficulty you might've caused, and then you make amends. And the AAA approach, I think can really be helpful to people to be better at in-the-moment apologies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:29):
Amazing. Matt, I think we've packed this episode with so many tactical golden nuggets to help people become better communicators, especially on the spot. Is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before I ask you how they can find you online and things like that?

Matt Abrahams (01:09:45):
Again, I want to go back to how we started the second part about spontaneous speaking. Everybody can get better at communication. And I encourage, I challenge people to take the steps that they need to take to do it. So it starts with initiative. It's followed by grace and a lot of compassion, it takes time. But in so doing, you can improve your communication and help others. It's not just about you finding your voice, it's about you sharing that voice with others. So taking the time to work on your communication is critically important, and I encourage everybody to do so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:18):
All right. I'm hoping people will follow that advice. And if not, think back to what we talked about at the beginning of just how much impact these have and how many people are also going through the same challenges you're probably feeling speaking and being on the spot. All right, where can folks find your podcast, your book, and also how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt Abrahams (01:10:37):
Oh, I love that last question. So mattabrahams.com, great place to go to to find things. So at mattabrahams.com you'll find a whole bunch of resources. My own and others. I've curated a bunch of resources. You can find Think Fast, Talk Smart wherever you get podcasts and on YouTube. And then the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is available everywhere. I'm a huge user of LinkedIn. And to answer that last question you asked, I invite people to connect on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear their stories and find ways to collaborate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
Awesome. And your podcast is ranked higher than this podcast. You're in a different category, which is a very competitive category. The business category. I've moved myself to the technology category, which feels more natural to me, but your podcast is killing it, so congrats.

Matt Abrahams (01:11:06):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:21):
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us. That's it. Matt, thank you again for being here.

## Transcript

Matt LeMay (00:00:00):
More product managers and teams are getting laid off. The problem is the message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024, we still have too many teams doing work around the work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
Even if you are told to build the thing that the execs are really excited about, you're still going to get fired eventually.

Matt LeMay (00:00:15):
If you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team? Frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Which is something you call the low impact PM Death Spiral.

Matt LeMay (00:00:26):
Is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in, one way or another.

(00:00:33):
It starts with adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements until the next round of layoffs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
You have three steps to become more of an impact first product team.

Matt LeMay (00:00:42):
So the first is in setting team goals, no more than one step away from company goals. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
You're an ICPM. It's up to you. No excuses.

Matt LeMay (00:00:52):
You can follow all the best practices, but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0. 6 or a 0.7.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Matt Lameé. Matt is a longtime product leader, author of one of the most popular and practical books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.

(00:01:12):
Over the course of his consulting practice, he's worked with hundreds of product teams, helping them improve how they operate and drive more impact, more consistently.

(00:01:20):
From that experience, he wrote and recently published a new book called Impact First Product Teams, that I could not agree more with.

(00:01:26):
In our conversation, Matt shares why it is so essential to align all of your work with business critical outcomes, especially if you fear layoffs at your company.

(00:01:35):
We talk about the low impact death spiral that many product teams fall into. What steps an individual product team can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organization approaches product development. Tips for how to push back on stupid ideas that execs ask you to build, and so much more.

(00:01:52):
The message in this episode is one that I believe every product manager needs to hear, especially if you don't work at a high-flying Silicon Valley tech company.

(00:02:00):
A huge thank you to Martin Erickson, Adrian Joselow, and Dan Corbin for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.

Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Matt LeMay (00:04:29):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm really, really excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):
I'm even more excited. You have a really interesting background. I usually don't spend time on background, but I thought this would be fun.

(00:04:38):
I was looking at your LinkedIn and your background. The beginning of your career you spent 13 years at Pitchfork reviewing music.

Matt LeMay (00:04:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:46):
Reviewing artists. Pitchfork was a massive deal. I don't know where it is today, but it was the most influential music review site. Is it still a big deal or is it less so?

Matt LeMay (00:04:55):
It is still a big deal. It was much less of a big deal when I started working for them and I was a 16-year-old music nerd, writing record reviews in my bedroom at my parents' apartment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
Okay, so what I'm hearing is you helped make them a big deal. Excellent. That's impacts. We're going to talk all about impact.

Matt LeMay (00:05:11):
If I were better at telling my own story, that's exactly what I'd be saying, is that before I started, I was product manager number one at Pitchfork.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:17):
Funny enough, you look at your resume, you went into product management from Pitchfork. Very typical career path.

(00:05:23):
By the way, if you're on YouTube watching, there's a lot of musical paraphernalia behind you, an awesome guitar, so clearly there's a thread of music throughout your background.

Matt LeMay (00:05:31):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):
Let me ask you this question: what is most similar about making music, and even critiquing music, and building great product?

Matt LeMay (00:05:39):
The magic lies in the way people work together. That's really what I think has been the consistent thread between all the work that I've done.

(00:05:47):
I spent years as a touring musician. I still occasionally tour in my friend Will Chef's band. And it's that magic of people with different perspectives, different ideas, building into something that is somehow greater than the sum of its individual parts and perspectives.

(00:06:03):
That's what makes this interesting. That's what makes music magical. That's what makes product development interesting, especially in the age of AI.

(00:06:13):
When people have the opportunity to, I think, close themselves off from the messier parts of human interaction, from those moments where you realize that your perspective might be limited, that somebody else might be able to expose you to something, show you a way of working, show you a way of seeing that you haven't seen before, I think that those interactions, that ability to learn from and build with each other, is only going to become more valuable and more precious, frankly, as technology continues to do what technology does.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:44):
Wow, what a beautiful answer.

Matt LeMay (00:06:45):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:47):
I love that. So let's get to the task at hand.

Matt LeMay (00:06:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):
So you're known for writing one of the most popular books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.

Matt LeMay (00:06:58):
I suppose I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:59):
Yes. Basically describes the job of a product manager very practically, very specifically, better than any other book out there.

(00:07:09):
You have a new book out called Impact First Product Teams. I asked you what the goal of this book was and you said the goal was what are the steps that individual product teams can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organizations approach product development?

(00:07:25):
And I thought this was a really nice way of framing this conversation. There's two important parts to the sentence that you gave me.

(00:07:32):
One is aligning your work to business critical outcomes, and the other is steps an individual product team can take, regardless of other business functions.

(00:07:40):
So let me start with this first part. This is kind of you named your book after this concept of impact, first: Why is aligning work to impact and to business critical outcomes so important?

Matt LeMay (00:07:51):
It's important because at the end of the day, it is those business critical outcomes against which you and your team will be evaluated. That's the reality of working for a business, right?

(00:08:02):
If you are contributing to the business in a way that the business at large can understand, that the CEO can understand, that the CFO can understand, if your team is a good investment for the business, then the business will continue making that investment.

(00:08:16):
If your team is not a good investment for the business or you don't really know if your team is a good investment for the business, but you figure you're showing up, so probably it's fine, you guess, then that puts you in a really tenuous position, and a position that I think we've all seen not work out terribly well for everybody in recent history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):
And so, what is this a reaction to? Because I imagine many people hearing this are, like, "Of course, PMs, product teams we're driving business impact, well, that's why we're here."

(00:08:44):
That's not actually the case in most cases. So first of all, just what is this reaction to? Is this the reaction to people being, like, "Oh, we're just going to build great products, we're going to listen to customers,"? Talk about the flip side of this.

Matt LeMay (00:08:55):
I mean, there's a couple of things. I think the main one is just more product managers and teams are getting laid off. That's a really scary reality right now.

(00:09:05):
And if you look at the messages that are being conveyed by CEOs when they lay off these teams, some of them are pretty clear.

(00:09:13):
The message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024 said, "We still have too many teams doing work around the work and supporting work, rather than focusing on opportunities with real impact."

(00:09:25):
And that really struck a nerve because I've been on those supporting teams before. I've done the work around the work. And I've assumed that if I was given work around the work to do, that surely it must be critical to the business, otherwise they wouldn't have hired me to do it.

(00:09:40):
I don't think that is a safe assumption to make. I think especially given that we are no longer in a zero interest rate environment, given that hiring and retaining employees is expensive, given that companies are looking at cost savings, I think we are in a moment where it is really incumbent upon each product team and each member of each product team to be able to understand, articulate, and work towards the top line business impact of their own work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Awesome. So where this comes from is, one, if you are not driving something that is directly driving business growth, you're not as valuable to the company. You're the kind of person that they'd lay off.

Matt LeMay (00:10:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):
There's also a flip side of finding a job. It feels like if you have shown impact in your resume, "Here's all the impact I've driven," this also helps you get hired. True?

Matt LeMay (00:10:31):
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's the most common resume advice I see, is show the number, show the impact, say what you did.

(00:10:40):
I have a friend who does resume coaching, and I showed her my resume a couple of years ago. And she said, "I love your resume except for one thing. Why do you write like a little girl? Say what you did, say what your contributions were. Don't say 'I helped. I may have maybe helped people do this'. Say the impact. Put the number on it." And I think I needed to hear that from her because I think there is a tendency, especially for those of us who do really thrive in that collaborative environment, who our nature is to not want to take credit for work that could only exist via the contributions of many people with diverse experiences and perspectives.

(00:11:22):
It's really hard to say, "Well, I did this and I contributed to that," but that's part of why I wrote this book at the team level, because I think for folks, like myself, who really enjoy and thrive in that team environment, if you can look at the product team as the foundational unit of impact and say, "We delivered this. We were able to work together to have this impact for the business," that feels really good and also speaks directly to the work that that team did together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:49):
That's a really interesting insight. I think a lot of this comes from just PMs naturally are trained to deflect credit and to include, say 'we' in everything and just this person did that. So I get where that comes from. So most listeners will probably still be thinking, "Yes, I'm driving impact, I'm great. I don't have a problem here. I don't to change, need to change anything." What are some ways to stress test your thinking? Maybe some questions to ask yourself or maybe your team of just, like, "Okay, maybe I'm not?"

Matt LeMay (00:12:17):
So the first question I ask most of the teams I work with is if you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team?

(00:12:29):
And that is a small question that can provoke some big reactions. Because, for me, when I was working as a product manager, I truly believed that my job was to find the next most defensible thing to build, build it, celebrate it, find the next most defensible thing to build, and so on and so forth. Rinse and repeat forever and ever.

(00:12:53):
I kind of assumed that the existence of my team was this righteous fact of the universe, right? My team would always be there for all time, and it was just a matter of us finding the next thing to work on, which meant doing discovery and making concessions to what leadership wanted and doing all that stakeholder management.

(00:13:13):
But the idea that my team came at a cost to the business, that at some point somebody might look at my team on a spreadsheet and say, "Who are these very expensive people? Why do we need them? Do we actually need them?" It just wasn't something that crossed my mind because I wasn't in the room for those conversations. That wasn't how I was thinking about my team's work.

(00:13:34):
So I like asking this question because it's a perspective shift. It gets you thinking if you were personally accountable for the existential market-level success of this business, would you invest in your team?

(00:13:52):
And frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away. They're not sure. They say, "I think so," or, "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because... " And then you can see the gears turning.

(00:14:05):
And again, to me that is a risky situation to be in because if you can't answer that question as a member of the team, nobody else in the organization is going to be as well-equipped to answer that question as you are.

(00:14:19):
So bringing that question to the team, asking it and answering it proactively and collaboratively and being ready to say, "Okay, if we can't answer this confidently, what are the changes we need to make? Do we need to change our purview? Do we need to change our goals? Who do we need to talk to? What do we need to do in order to make this happen, in order to answer that question confidently?" We are much better off having that conversation at the team level than waiting for someone else to have it for us, or at us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
So is kind of the signal here is if you can't confidently say yes, asking yourself this question or your team talking through this and having a clear answer, there's maybe a potential problem that you need to work on?

Matt LeMay (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I think that's exactly it, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:04):
And we'll talk about what to actually do and the steps you recommend to fix this problem, but I want to keep talking about impact because sometimes it takes a while for people to be convinced, "Okay, I need to really do this," versus, "Okay, here's the ways to do this."

Matt LeMay (00:15:15):
Yeah. It has taken me until now, until writing this book to be convinced, and I still feel like I need to be convinced a little bit sometimes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:22):
I think the layoffs are a really good convincing function for people.

Matt LeMay (00:15:26):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:26):
Where they're seeing all these PMs being laid off and just, like, "How do I avoid that?" And this is basically the answer to that, is here's how you avoid getting laid off.

(00:15:33):
There's an interesting implication in what you describe here where you encourage the PM and the product team to think like the CEO.

(00:15:39):
This touches on something I've been meaning to write about, but I haven't, which is a lot of people, there's this argument are PMs the mini CEO?

(00:15:46):
In my mind, the PM is 100% the mini CEO, in terms of they think like the CE or they should within the team. They're the same; their job is to think about the business like a CEO within the team.

(00:16:03):
Obviously they're not in charge of everyone. They can't let get anyone go. The reporting lines are not the same. But I feel like that's a really good lens for the job of a PM, is just you're like the mini CEO on a team, making sure you're building the right things, thinking about the business, solving real problems that matter.

Matt LeMay (00:16:19):
I think the way I've come to think about it is that the product manager is responsible for the whole team thinking like a CEO, if that makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:26):
I love that.

Matt LeMay (00:16:27):
So if the product manager takes that on as their sole responsibility and says, "I'm the mini CEO. I think about the business," that's a missed opportunity.

(00:16:35):
In my consulting work, it's more often than not been an engineer who's actually able to get to that specific impact-level goal for the team, sometimes before the product manager does, because the engineer is thinking in systems, is thinking about, "Okay, I know this system, I know this other system. I've had this conversation with this person. I think I see how this can all fit together."

(00:16:55):
Sometimes it's a designer or a UX researcher who understands what customers need and who has that direct firsthand knowledge.

(00:17:02):
So I think the way that I certainly initially misinterpreted the mini CEO thing was you are solely in charge of this, as opposed to you are the person who brings that kind of CEO-level commercial thinking to the team. And I've been much more inclined of late to see the product manager's job as to bring in and facilitate that conversation, rather than to be the sole owner of that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):
That is a really good Nuance to what I said, and it makes all the sense in the world.

(00:17:34):
Following these lines of what is the job for product manager, you have a really nice way of just thinking about it. What does a business expect from a product manager?

Matt LeMay (00:17:42):
Yeah. My favorite definition of product management comes from Melissa Perry's book Escaping the Build Trap, where she describes product management as facilitating a value exchange.You're facilitating a value exchange between a business and its customers.

(00:17:57):
The actual shape and nature of that value exchange depends on so many things. It depends on your funding model, it depends on your business model, it depends on whether you're B2B or B2C, it depends on whether you're publicly traded or privately held. There are so many different variables that go into what a business expects from product teams.

(00:18:19):
And one thing I've come to is that I'm probably too hesitant to generalize in general, aside from that generalization I just made, but I think that the best product managers and teams I've worked with are really curious to understand what success means to their particular business.

(00:18:38):
So if that's a startup, how much runway do we have? What do we need to raise that next round? Are our investors looking for growth? Are they looking for profitability? What are they looking for in order for us to reach that next existential milestone?

(00:18:52):
If we're a publicly traded company, what are investors looking for? What have we told shareholders? What's in our next prospectus? What are we saying we're going to deliver to the market at large?

(00:19:01):
This information usually exists somewhere, but it's really easy to get disconnected from it as we go about the day-to-day work of doing product management.

(00:19:11):
I've been in a lot of rooms having workshops and sessions with teams I work with, where they're pulling up the last town hall meeting to look for slides from their CEO because they're so busy, they have so many day-to-day things to deal with, that for them that town hall day is, like, "Okay, finally I can just not have to deal with people emailing me every 10 seconds." It's a chance to take a deep breath and then get back to the stuff that really matters.

(00:19:38):
But those top-level things, those promises that have been made to the market at large, to the board, to the shareholders, those are often a great place to start for understanding what exactly your business is looking for, so you can figure out how your team's work helps contribute to success in the terms that matter most to the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
That's an amazing segue to exactly where I'd wanted to go, which is this quote that is exactly what you just said, the question you should be asking, it's kind of a different version of the one you shared earlier, which is what are we doing to contribute to the success of the business?

Matt LeMay (00:20:14):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:15):
So what is it that you think people are thinking instead most often?

Matt LeMay (00:20:21):
It's interesting. We live in a world where for the last 20 years of product development, we've been all about best practices. We love best practices.

(00:20:30):
And I love best practices too. I think best practices can be really valuable, can be really useful. I love how much knowledge sharing there is out there. When I started 15 years ago, it was so much harder to get any sense of how anybody was doing anything.

(00:20:44):
But I think the downside of this is that there are a lot of folks who are really, really fixated on doing things the right way. And a lot of the writing and thinking about doing things the right way exists in kind of this middle layer, between impact and day-to-day work.

(00:21:03):
So if you have impact, the overall success of the business, revenue, growth, profits. Then from there you set objectives and you do initiatives, and then you do bets, and then you make a strategy, and then you do your day-to-day work.

(00:21:15):
I think the tendency among a lot of product teams is to key to those middle pieces, to say, "Okay, what we're doing is on strategy. What we're doing is part of objectives. We did OKRs, right? We spent three weeks coming up with our OKRs for three months. It's OKR season, everybody. We have to pretend to care about our goals, and I read a book that says we have to have five to seven objectives with five to seven key results, and we want the score of each one to be a 0.6 or a 0.7."

(00:21:41):
And at the end of the day, you've actually spent so much time and energy being really clever and cascading these things into these intermediate steps, that each step has incurred more and more risk that we might not achieve that impact we seek to drive.

(00:21:59):
Each time we abstract things out, each time we cascade things from impact to something else until we wind up with a checklist of features to build, we're assuming that if we then build that checklist of features... We will have a successful business.

(00:22:14):
But honestly, most of the companies and teams I work with, if I ask them how their lowest-level goals add up to their highest-level goals, they look at me like I just asked them the most impossible question in the world.

(00:22:27):
Because by the time you get things down to that level, maybe it's going to work, maybe it's not going to work. There are assumptions baked into each of those levels.

(00:22:37):
You might go through the motions of doing OKRs the right way or doing strategy the right way, but that doesn't guarantee that your strategy is going to work. It doesn't mean that your OKRs are going to add up to what your investors or your shareholders need to see.

(00:22:52):
So I think there's a tendency among product teams to really sweat the middle, and to get really stressed out if the middle is not in perfect theoretical harmony with itself. If the objectives are a little out of line with the initiatives, are a little out of line with the bets, are a little out of line with the domains.

(00:23:14):
But at the end of the day, I don't think I've ever worked for a company where these things add up to a perfect breadcrumb trail you can trace back from, "We prioritized these bits of work in this sprint because it adds up to this objective, which is part of this strategy, which adds up to this initiative, which is part of this bet, which will deliver this much impact." It's just not how things work in the real world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):
I feel like a lot of listeners are, like, "That sounds very familiar," exactly what you just described. Again, we're going to talk about what to change and how to make work better to actually align your teams with impact. But I want to first talk about something that follows this thread you're on, which is something you call the Low Impact PM Death Spiral. Talk about what that looks like.

Matt LeMay (00:23:55):
The Death Spiral.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:56):
I love the hands.

Matt LeMay (00:23:59):
The Low Impact Death Spiral is the dynamic in which every-

Matt LeMay (00:24:00):
... impact death spiral is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in one way or another. And honestly, a lot of small product companies do as well, and it goes something like this. It starts with teams taking on low impact work. Adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements because it's easier, it invites less scrutiny and you're less likely to mess up something important, right? The analogy I use sometimes is if you're working on a car, if you put your hands in the engine, you might make the car run really well or you might make it so that the car doesn't run at all. If you have the option of doing that or decking out the car with a paint job and rhinestones and making it look really, really cool, what are you going to choose to do? I know for me, I would choose the rhinestones every time because then the car runs however it runs. Whoever else is the expert in engines can fix the engine, but I'm going to do this thing which everyone can see. All the executives can look at it and say, "Wow, look at how cool this car looks," and it's not going to do any harm, right? What's the worst that could happen? We can always take the paint off.

(00:25:15):
The problem is if you have 10 teams adding rhinestones to a car, eventually the hood of the car is going to be so heavy that you can't lift it to get to the engine anymore, and that's exactly what happens in most product organizations. As you have more and more teams adding in these little features, making little enhancements, adding features, which might get some usage, but they're not going to take away anything meaningful, they're not going to mess with the commercial engine of the business. You have more folks building in and the hood of the car gets heavier and heavier, the product gets more and more complicated.

(00:25:50):
You have all these little bits that have little dependencies on each other and the product becomes as, I think most modern products are a collection of loosely connected features rather than a single guided experience. What does that mean? That means internally, building anything becomes a lot harder, right? Because there's 10 product teams that have to manage dependencies whenever you want to build something, so companies start adding program management layers. They're like, "We have too many meetings. We need to reorg for program management because reorgs fix everything and we need to make sure that we have all these layers and people are connected and we're doing dependency management." But as you add more of those things, it becomes harder and harder to do high-impact work.

(00:26:33):
The hood just gets heavier and heavier and heavier, which in turn sends teams deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of low-impact work. Low-impact work begets low-impact work. The more low-impact work you do, the harder it is to do high-impact work, the more likely you are to do low-impact work and so on and so forth. It goes and goes and goes until the next round of layoffs, and this is a real problem.

(00:27:01):
I've experienced this at again, pretty much every company I've worked with, and it's been really interesting to see how often the breaking of that cycle comes down to individual product teams being brave enough to look at their own work and look at what matters to the business and say, "You know what? We are not going to incur the risk of being a low-impact team anymore. We are going to proactively seek out high- impact work and we're going to deliver, even if it means we have to coordinate with a lot of other teams. Even if it means that suddenly the executive team takes a really big interest in the work that we're doing. We're going to see that as signs that the work we're doing matters not as things that are going to be an impediment to getting the work done."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):
As you just kind of alluded to, there's a big implication here of even if you are told to build a thing that the execs are really excited about, that is low impact in your opinion, that's no excuse. You're still going to get fired eventually, even though they're telling you to build it. It sucks, but that's how it goes.

Matt LeMay (00:28:04):
It's funny, I worked with MailChimp for three years leading up to their acquisition by Intuit, when they were on this really interesting journey of going from a single product company to a platform company, which is a journey that a lot of companies are on. Where they've found success in one part of the market and they say, "You know what? We recognize that there's a value add in working more horizontally and giving people a suite of tools they can use. We want to build these tools and really make sure that we are meeting the needs of our small and medium business customers."

(00:28:34):
So I was brought on shortly after they did a reorg. They went into a domains model. They had different teams that were supposed to be experts on different parts of this marketing platform that were building in new features and their VP product, Natalia Williams, who then became their CPO, she said, "This is great that we're doing this, but I'm worried that we're going to lose sight of the commercial fundamentals. We have these teams building this really cool stuff and we've been so clear that we're excited about the teams that are working on initiative, that are building these new things, that are building out this platform, but let's make sure we stay focused on making sure that the entire platform grows in a healthy and sustainable way. And that as we are adding in these new features and functionalities, we're not making this so crowded and complicated that it's harder for people to get value out of it."

(00:29:31):
So she set a very clear goal for the product team. She wanted a specific change in the rate of users who successfully send their first email. She was like, "As we build these new things, email is still where people are coming in. We want to make sure that they can do this successfully." And she set a really ambitious goal for the entire product organization. And she put it forth to the product teams and a lot of product teams were understandably hesitant to take this on, for a number of reasons. They said, "If we mess this up, that's the entire commercial heart of the business. That's really risky."

(00:30:12):
Other ones said, "That's great, but we're building out these new parts of the platform that are really important. We don't want to risk slowing those things down." There was one product manager I worked with who really understood how important this was. She had worked on enough different parts of the app at that point. She had been on a growth team, so she really had that kind of user-centric, how do we hit the metrics we need to hit mindset? And she came to me and she was like, "I want to make sure we do this because I'm worried about what'll happen if we don't do this, right? I don't want to be on the product team that failed to deliver what matters most to the business."

(00:30:53):
So she went and worked with some user researchers and found where people were getting stuck. She did this amazing study finding where people were getting stuck before they sent that first email and she gathered together a group of product managers. I'll never forget this. I was on site in Atlanta and she gathered together a group of product managers and she was like, "Look, these are the things we need to fix if we're going to hit this, but if we fix these things, I think we can do it. I think we can get there." And there was a moment of silence where again, for totally understandable reasons, people were like, "Okay, this is great. I see it, but I'm kind of afraid that if we do this," and this product manager, I will never forget that.

(00:31:34):
She looks around the room and she says, "You know what? I'm going to haunt all of you in your dreams if you do not take this on. This is the most important thing for the business." And everyone laughed. It was a strong comment, but it was a strong comment made in really good faith that in its own way, I think acknowledged the fear that people had about taking this on. She was like, "Look, this is really important and if we work together, if we care less about the constraints and parameters and borders of our domains and care more about how we work together to deliver the thing that our leader has told us is the most important thing for the business, we can get this done."

(00:32:15):
And they did get it done, and they got it done through subtracting. They streamlined the experience. They took out steps that people were getting stuck on. They made things easier. They did the kinds of things that are rarely celebrated in the way that traditional feature launches were celebrated, but because they had this clear, impactful, specific sense of what success looks like, they were able to take on that work themselves and it made the product better, made the business better, and it was just a great moment of working with a great team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
That was an awesome example. I love just how much of a hero's journey this example is. Along those lines, it's interesting how much courage it takes to do this. Because to your point, the easy thing is just, "Okay, everyone's just telling us to do this thing. We're going to build this feature. Great, easy. I don't have to put myself out there." And what you're pointing out there is it's up to you to recognize what you're doing is not high impact and to have courage to push back and suggest something else.

Matt LeMay (00:33:15):
The funny thing is, it's courage, but it's also a kind of radical acceptance of reality. There's a very kind of emotional philosophical dimension to this conversation because I think it is in human nature to not want to be accountable for things outside of our control. Impact is not something we can just check off a list. If we're really working towards business impact, that means that there are things that might happen in the market that are going to affect us, right? Our competitors might launch something, there might be a pandemic or a war or something we didn't expect. We're reliant upon customers to change their behavior, to convert or to upgrade or to do whatever it is we hope they will do.

(00:33:58):
I use the word hope because again, we can do our best to influence that behavior, but we can't just check a box. And I think there is this very understandable human fear of being accountable for things that are beyond our control. I get that so hard, but what I think the last couple of years have shown us is that we are accountable for things outside of our control. The success of the businesses we work for is ultimately beyond our immediate control.

(00:34:26):
And you can follow all the best practices and have the highest velocity and do everything quote-unquote "right", but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to say, "Yeah, we're going out of business, but we're going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0.6 or a 0.7." That's not how it works. The reality is that things outside of our control affect us, and I think that if we can internalize that, there's a real freedom in it. The thing that surprised me most when I was researching this book is that the commercially minded PMs I interviewed were also the happiest, which I did not expect at all.

(00:35:06):
As you said, I come from a music background. I was expecting the business people to be really stressed out, and like, "I have to show up at work 92 hours a day to crush it and make sure that we hit the metrics and crush the numbers." But they were just like, "Yeah, I work for a business and I do the best I can, and then I go home. When I'm at work, my job is to help the business succeed. And I do that by understanding our business model, by trying to do work that contributes to what the business wants. In order to do that, if my goals are really impact level goals, I have to learn about our customers. I have to do discovery, I have to do all these things that we're supposed to do, not because they're abstract best practices, but because that's how you build a successful product."

(00:35:49):
And then at the end of the day, I'm not fighting my company to do product the right way, and if they can't do it the right way, I'm willing to die on this hill. It's like, " I work for a company. I don't get to make every decision. There are things outside of my control. I'll do the best I can, and I get to free up a little bit of energy to live the rest of my life."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):
To make this even less scary, hopefully, I'm curious what your answer is going to be here. Do you find that people who take this leap and push back and try to change the way their teams are thinking and what they take on, do you find that even if they fail, even if they impact wasn't there and the project fails, they're seen more favorably and their career ends up doing better and they end up doing better even if the project fails?

Matt LeMay (00:36:36):
I hope so. I'm always super, again, it's outside of my control. I can't say, if you do these things, then you will be looked upon favorably by the people who manage you because I don't know those people, and maybe they're not going to react well. Maybe they're not actually... People are not always rational, and these things don't always play out the way you hope they will. What I will say is there's a story in the book, in Impact-First Product Teams about somebody who worked for a dating app, and they were given a project to work on, which had a very specific ambitious revenue goal. And at a certain point, it became clear that they were probably not going to be able to hit this because of other things they needed to do.

(00:37:15):
So they went to the finance team and said, "Hey, we have to adjust this down." And the finance team said, "Yeah, of course you do. That makes sense. Let's adjust it down together." Would that conversation have played out the same way if they had not taken that step of saying proactively, " Based on what is happening in the broader world in the market, our product, we no longer believe we are on track to hit this, but we want to adjust so that the company at large can make better predictions and resource things accordingly"?

(00:37:42):
I don't know. But I think again, if you are embracing that mindset that there are things outside of your control and your job is to do what you can from where you sit to contribute to the success of the business, I think you're certainly doing so much more by telling the business honestly what you think is possible and what's going to happen, as opposed to stepping back from it and saying like, "Oh, well, if we talk about it, we're going to get in trouble and nobody's going to believe us." And just that simple withholding of information does its own kind of harm. So I can't guarantee any kind of outcomes. I can't say, "Yes, this will be received with generosity and grace," in all cases, but I think it's the right thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:29):
My sense is either you will be respected more highly because you are kind of solving problems for people, like higher ups that you're seeing, things that they should be seeing, and you're right, and they're like, "Oh, wow, Matt's amazing. He saw all this stuff and changed." Or you realize this is not the company for me. They don't value this. They just want me to ship this widget and that's all they want from me. I could do more somewhere else.

Matt LeMay (00:38:56):
Well, I think you touched on something really important there, which is that when you understand the business model, you understand the real world ethics and priorities of the company you work for, right? If you understand what the company's optimizing for, what they really care about, what trade-offs and sacrifices they're willing to make in order to achieve those goals, that tells you a lot more than the mission statement. Which usually sounds great, but if you follow the money, if you follow the decision-making, sometimes it paints a different picture.

(00:39:28):
And I think the more you can understand how the business model works, what that value exchange is, what value is being delivered, what value is being extracted, that I think puts you in a better position to decide, if I were to help the company achieve success, do I feel good about that? Do I feel like this is a company that if it achieves its goals has made the world a better place or not? And the more you understand the business model, the better equipped you are to make those decisions with all the information available to you, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
That's such an important point.

(00:40:07):
Today's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing and all kinds of stuff. Just last week, I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me, what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions? How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment, results, and competitive intel?

(00:40:43):
Claude can handle incredibly complex multi-step work. You can throw 100-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations, including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources. Claude just becomes part of your workflow. If you want to try it out, get started at claude.ai/lenny and using this link, you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's claude.ai/lenny.

(00:41:24):
Okay, so let's shift to talking about how to actually, what to do. This concept of actions you can take regardless of how your company operates. And that first part is really important. Something that I've seen you big on is you don't let people have an excuse for not pushing on this. And we've talked about this in other ways, but just maybe share more of just like you don't have an excuse no matter how your company operates, to not think deeply about this and try to make change.

Matt LeMay (00:41:51):
Yeah, I mean, the reality is that most companies that product managers work at aren't big tech companies. And when I worked with product teams at those companies, at insurance companies or at banks or at CPG companies, or I worked with a company a while ago that makes audio equipment, which was obviously really fun for me, the first thing they usually tell me is, "Well, we can't do product the right way because we're a regulated industry," or, "because we're B2B," or, "because we have these quarterly earnings targets we need to hit."

(00:42:22):
And that always makes me a little sad because yes, there's a way of looking at it where you can say, "All right, if these five famous companies do product management the right way, then anything that puts us in a different situation from those companies must mean that we're doing product management the wrong way," which is demoralizing and distressing, and again, leads people to these kind of quixotic battles of like, "I have to turn a bank into a search engine," which is not going to happen.

(00:42:49):
But the other way of looking at it is that those constraints are how you do product management. Those are what guides you to the commercial decisions you should be making. If you're regulated, your competitors are regulated too. If you can really understand those constraints, figure out how to work well within them, that's a huge commercial advantage for your business. If you're B2B, I honestly prefer working with B2B companies in a lot of situations because they have such immediate access to their customers and they can understand the whole system of their customers and their users and how these things connect in a way that's really immediate and actionable.

(00:43:24):
Similarly, if your company has quarterly financial targets to hit, congratulations, you know what the business really cares about. You don't have to go looking much farther than that. You don't necessarily need to cascade that 10 different levels into 45 OKRs if you can do work that you know feeds directly into what the company cares about the most.

(00:43:47):
So yes, these things are constraints, but they're the constraints that shape the work that we do. And if we embrace them as such, if we treat them as guides, not restrictions, if we say we're working with not against the commercial realities of our business, there's so much we can do. There's so much that product managers and product owners and project managers that everybody working on product at every organization can do if we again work with, not against the realities of the companies we work for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):
Okay. So I think that's really empowering. You're not saying, "You need to change the way product is built at your company. It's up to you. You're an ICPM, it's up to you. No excuses." What's a simple way to describe what you're actually saying, which I think is going to make people feel a lot better?

Matt LeMay (00:44:38):
What I'm actually saying is that the things you think you're fighting against are usually the things that are giving your work shape, if you let them be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Awesome. Let's talk about, you have three steps, three handy steps to become more of an impact-first product team. So let's talk through them. What is step one?

Matt LeMay (00:44:59):
Yeah, so the first step, and I think the most important and where a lot of my work plays out is in setting team goals, close to company goals. No more than one step away from company goals. This idea comes from Christina Wodtke's book Radical Focus. She had a great episode on your podcast that I just re-watched for inspiration before I came on here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:22):
Nice move.

Matt LeMay (00:45:24):
But in that book, she has this visual where she says that most companies approach cascading OKR as kind of this multi-level, like at the top is company goals, then department goals, then big team goals, then small team goals, and smaller team goals. Which leads to the very situation I described where you can't add those small team goals back up to the company goals. She has a visual that she compares that to, which is the company goal as a center of gravity, and then every other team goal orbiting one level around it. And this blew my mind when I saw it for the first time, because whether you're doing OKRs or KPIs or north star metrics, whatever framework you're ostensibly using, if you use it well, it looks like that.

(00:46:09):
I worked with a team a while ago that was a traditional feature team at a FinTech company. They were the team that was kind of like the team I worked with at MailChimp, kind of given new features to build to take this product and build it more into a multi-product platform. And the business would say, "Go build this." They'd build it, they'd celebrate, they'd say, "Go build this." They'd build it, they'd celebrate. And then the business said, "Okay, we're going to do things a little bit differently. Now we have this top line revenue target. We want to make this much more money next year, and we want you to tell us how you're going to contribute to this."

(00:46:42):
And this was a really challenging conversation for this team because as much as people complain about being feature factories, again, it feels safer, right? There's more control over that. If you're told what to build, you have a lot more control over whether or not you build it than you do over whether or not it generates revenue. So we started having this conversation, what framework should we use? How should we do this? And I was not asking very good questions. I was kind of panicking too, to be honest. And then I asked them, I was like, "Okay, why does this team exist, right? Why are we doing this at all? Why is the business investing in this big team to build all these features? Why do we care if we're a single-product company or a multi-product platform company?"

(00:47:26):
And one of the team leaders said, "Oh, well actually, the customer lifetime value of a multi-product user is much higher than that of a single-product user." I was like, "Oh, do we know how much higher?" And they said, "Yeah, we actually have a number on that." And I was like, "Wow. So if we had a goal of converting a certain number of single-product users to multi-product users, we know exactly how much revenue is on the line." They were like, "Yeah, I guess so." So we were able to set a goal, and from there we had this conversation about what's the number we would need to hit to make this team feel like a good investment? And we came to a specific number and-

Matt LeMay (00:48:00):
To make this team feel like a good investment. And we came to a specific number and that number informed every decision that was made by that team for the rest of the year. We said, "By the end of the year, we need to convert this many single product users to multi-product users because if we do that, there's this much additional revenue which contributes this much to the company's top line revenue goal." It's one step away.

(00:48:22):
And when they went and shared that goal with company leadership, they got it right away. They didn't have to say, "Well, why is this valuable?" They didn't have to say, "What are your other OKRs? Show us the deck." They got it. And that gave them so much leeway to make bolder decisions, to work more closely with other teams to ask for the resources they needed. And that process of arriving at that goal, that goal that is impactful and specific and one step away from what the company cares about the most, is probably the most valuable way I have spent my time with teams of late. Because once you get to that, you see how everything else flows from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:01):
And the implication here is that if it's too far away from people understanding what the hell are you guys even doing to help the business? That's the problem you want to avoid.

Matt LeMay (00:49:10):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:11):
So one extreme is, I don't know, it probably doesn't make sense for your team to have exactly the same goal as the company. Say your company's trying to grow a hundred million revenue rate, that's not going to be your team's goal. So it's almost like that extreme is what's one step away from that? What's your contribution to that company goal?

(00:49:29):
The other end is just some 10 level deep, we're going to improve conversion of this random step, which is going to grow this thing which grows that, and then that grows revenue.

Matt LeMay (00:49:37):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:38):
What is your guidance on revenue-based goals as goals for teams?

Matt LeMay (00:49:43):
I think, again, it depends. I know people have very strong opinions about teams should always or should never have revenue-based goals. I don't think it's that simple. I think sometimes yes, if your company is working towards revenue, having a revenue-based goal makes sense, or at least being able to put some value in terms of revenue on the work that your team is doing. I've worked with some startups where they actively are not going after revenue because right now the name of the game is growth, right? They want to show that they have enough users to raise that next round of investment. I actually worked with one startup where their revenue was going up, and their number of users was going up, and we had to have a really interesting conversation around which one actually matters to our investors. And we kind of wound up developing these two scenarios, the high growth scenario and the low growth scenario.

(00:50:33):
And talking to the product team, it was really clear that there was no way they were going to hit the high growth scenario. So they pivoted to focus on profitability so they could build more runway and raise that next round as a smaller business with a sustainable revenue base.

(00:50:46):
So I get why people are hesitant to commit to revenue goals. I think that there are certainly situations where revenue goals would be too broad or not exactly what the business needs, but at the end of the day, money is how the impact of most teams is going to be measured. And if you don't have a point of view on why your team is a good investment, either in the money return it brings, or in another return that is equally or more important to the business, then again, that feels like a tenuous and risky position to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:25):
To kind of get people's brains noodling in the right direction. What are some examples of good goals, like specific goals that your teams have set that are one step away from a company goal? What are just some examples without naming companies?

Matt LeMay (00:51:38):
I have a story to tell to that effect, which also sets up the second step here, which is to keep impact first at every step.

(00:51:47):
So, I worked with a growth team at a tech company that is beloved by many the people. And I was brought on to help them set OKRs, right? The company was doing OKRs across the board, and this team was going to set its growth OKRs. So they had done a lot of reading, a lot of research into how to do OKRs the right way. They had read, unfortunately, they had not read Radical Focus or they hopefully would've done things differently, they had read a lot of other books. They had printed out a lot of articles and they said, "We're going to make sure we get this right. We're going to put together a slide deck that has five to seven objectives with five to seven key results each, and each key result is going to have an owner and we're going to make sure that people are accountable for it. And we're going to really, really do this the right way. We're going to get that middle piece perfect."

(00:52:39):
So they spent a long time working on these OKRs, OKR season ends. They file away the OKR deck not to be seen until the next OKR season. We reconvene, and spend a whole day scoring all of the OKRs. And there are heated conversations about what's a 0.6 versus a 0.7? Is this a 0.9? Who really should be the owner of this key result? Who contributed the most to it? And we get through this whole conversation, everyone's tired. And I'm like, "There's just one question I need to ask. I'm so sorry to do this to y'all, but how does this all add up to the company level growth goals?"

(00:53:23):
People look around and they're like, "Well, that wasn't what we did. We set our team level OKRs and we went through the process and we made sure, and we followed the OKRs, we thought about the OKRs," and I said, "Yeah, but the company has a goal of let's call it bringing on a million new users in this year. We're a growth team. How many users did we bring on?"

(00:53:50):
And there's a moment of silence. And the leader of this team's a really, really good leader. She stands and she's like, "Okay, we're going to do things differently." She steps up to the whiteboard, puts 1 million on the right end of the whiteboard, draws a line, "This is the year," draws a little tick on the line. "This is where we are now. It's a smaller number than a million. This is where we need to get to. If our conversation doesn't start with this, I don't want to have the conversation. And if you are 51% sure that a different approach is going to get us 1% closer, I expect you to advocate for that approach. And this is now how we are going to do everything."

(00:54:34):
And I think about that all the time, because it's subtracting steps. It's making things less complicated. It actually is doing exactly what you described. It's saying, "This is what the company cares about. We're the growth team. We need to figure out how everything we're doing contributes to this."

(00:54:55):
That story really stuck with me because it seems like it should be obvious, right? If you're the growth team at a company with a growth goal, obviously that's going to be something you care about. But it's so easy in the day-to-day work of setting these intermediate goals, of doing strategy, of doing the things we do to make things just a little bit more complicated than they need to be. So for this particular team and this particular moment, a good goal was looking at the company level goal and saying, "If we're the team that's driving growth, we're accountable for this. We're going to step up and we're going to do everything we can to make sure, the company meets its ambition."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:38):
And it's so obvious if you come at it from the perspective you shared earlier. If you're the CEO, would you fund this team? If you see our goal is a million users, this team will drive us a hundred thousand users. Assuming that's a lot for you. Obviously we want that team to do great and we're going to give them the resources to do that. They're going to contribute meaningfully to this goal. It's very obvious as you see it. The trick is a lot of people think they're doing that and they're not. Maybe one heuristic I think about as you're talking is just like, how do you know if you're doing this? There should be a very simple spreadsheet formula of just here's the company goal, here's your goal. There should be one simple formula that translates up that adds to it.

Matt LeMay (00:56:20):
One Y statement and or one mathematical operator is usually the way I think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:24):
There we go.

Matt LeMay (00:56:26):
In some cases, like the story I told about that FinTech company, it's something like upgraded users. That's one step, right? You multiply that by the increased customer lifetime value. In some cases, it's a smaller unit of the same thing. So it's a subset of the revenue or growth that the company's trying to deliver.

(00:56:47):
I worked with a company recently that had a team rebuilding their ad tech platform. This is a big company that does a lot of different things, and at the heart of all of their different offerings is this ad tech platform. And I was brought on to do a day long workshop with this company because this was a really important team and they were struggling to figure out what success looked like.

(00:57:06):
So I said, "Okay, what are your goals?" And they said, "Here's the deck with our goals." I said, "That's a lot of goals. I wouldn't be able to make decisions with those goals." They said, "Oh wait, wait, wait, no, we also have a Miro board. We went through this and we decided the deck was too much. So we also have a Miro board," but as Miro boards tend to do, it kind of grew and grew and grew in all directions. So now it's a big board. Turned out they had two Miro boards because they had tried to do this twice.

(00:57:33):
So we sat down and we did this really interesting kind of subtractive exercise, where everybody got a post-it note to write down what they think the most important goal of the team is. And then they would pair up and they would have to make it smaller each time, make it more concise. If there were two things, get it down to one thing. If there were 10 words, bring it down to eight words, make it smaller and more concise each time.

(00:57:56):
And we came up with two options. One was build a fantastic, wonderful, magical, beautiful platform to increase our team's profits by 20%. Fair enough. The other one was, build a stupendous, wonderful, fantastic platform to increase our team's profits in the next financial year from 20 million pounds to a hundred million pounds.

(00:58:18):
And I'm looking at these and I'm like, "Okay, so we know that there is an expectation of revenue here. There's an expectation that we will drive profitability, but one of these is 20% and the other is 500%. Where do these numbers come from?" And the folks who had said 20%, they were like, "That feels like a good return." And what's interesting was when I was telling the story, when I was giving some talks recently, and people would kind of laugh like, "Oh, they named the wrong number." But they were so brave to do that, and them saying 20% is what actually unlocked the conversation at the team level, because somebody else in the room heard that and said, "Wait, I do remember something about profits. There was some target we were supposed to hit, but I think I remember it being a lot bigger than that." And they actually went back and found a town hall that their VP had given and buried in a slide in that town hall was this hundred million pound profit target by the end of the next financial year.

(00:59:22):
So they have this number and they start to go like, "Oh gosh, that's a lot, but it's a whole financial year. It'll be fine." And we do, again, inspired by that leader I worked with, I just put this out on a whiteboard. I'm like, "All right, a hundred million in profits by the end of the next financial year right now we're here. What else should be on this timeline?" Somebody said, "Well, we're launching this in October." So I put October up there. I go, "Okay, so if we don't ship anything until October, and right now it's March, how much profit do we make until?" And they said, "About 10 million." I'm like, "Okay. So that means that between October and March, we need to generate 90 million pounds of profits."

(01:00:06):
And this team, I was worried they were going to freak out or they were going to be like, "Oh, we can't do this. It's impossible." But they were like, "Okay, it's time to step up. It's time to do all these things that we need to do. We need to ship sooner. We need to do more validation. We need to do more testing. Can we commercialize things sooner? Can we do more discovery to make sure that this is really going to have the impact we need to have? Why are we doing this whole big relaunch? Why don't we rebuild individual things? What impact will we have if we brought more people in top of funnel now? Can we begin building our user base and then upgrade that user base? What are the trade-offs if we do that versus if we bring people in?"

(01:00:41):
All those things that I think is really the heart and the intent of these best practices. They came to life because this team had clarity. They understood like, "Okay, we are accountable for something which is specific enough to drive some real urgency, and which is impactful enough that we have to get out there and do all these things that we're supposed to do."

(01:01:05):
So that to me, is a really good example of how if you start with this question of like, well, what's expected of this team? What does success look like for us? It'll often lead you to the right neighborhood of what kind of unit of measure you want to look for, how the business is going to look to you, whether they're looking directly at revenue, whether they're looking at something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:29):
Okay. These stories are awesome. So basically, so far, the two steps that you've illustrated here of doing this correctly, step one is set team goals that are close to company goals. And then step two is, do this at every step of the product building process. It's not just a one-time thing at the beginning.

Matt LeMay (01:01:46):
Right. As you're doing OKRs, like that team I talked about, when you're thinking about your company strategy, when you're writing epics, whatever it is, keep that impactful goal top of mind. Don't let it slip away. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:02):
Because to your point, the examples you shared where you think you're just like, "Cool, we have our goal, let's go." And then you spend months doing this thing and then you forget, okay, this actually got disconnected from the company goal.

Matt LeMay (01:02:12):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):
Everything you've worked hard to do is just, no one cares.

Matt LeMay (01:02:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
Okay. What is step three?

Matt LeMay (01:02:18):
Step three is to connect every bit of work back to impact. So this is when we get to the prioritization piece, right.

(01:02:26):
So impact estimation is something that is written about quite well, quite extensively in product management stuff, but it's something that it's easy to not do. I work with a lot of teams that want to know, again, the right best practice for doing prioritization, whether that's should we use ICE or RICE or MoSCoW or whatever it is, what's the right way to do prioritization? And again, it depends, but if you don't have a clear and specific sense of what impact means, you can't really prioritize effectively. So this is where, again, everything comes back to that first step of the way you set goals.

(01:03:13):
So that team I told you about that had the goal of converting single product users to multi-product users, one of the product managers on that team came back to me a few months later and said, "Hey, Matt, I could really use your help figuring out how to do prioritization. Should we do ICE? Should we do RICE? Should we do MoSCoW? I put together an ICE matrix where I scored impact and I scored certainty and I scored effort, and I multiplied each one by each one, and I have a list of the things we should do."

(01:03:38):
And I said, "That's awesome." And I do really think it's awesome when people take the initiative to do the thing to say, "I put this together, let's walk through it." So when they showed me this, I said, "Let's start with impact." They're like, "Okay, well here's the score for each one." I was like, "What's the score?" They're like, "Oh, it's a lot of different things." And I said, "Okay, well, we have a team goal of a certain specific number of users we need to convert by the end of the year, so let's try to express impact as a function of that goal. So rather than an abstract score, what is the most number of users we could convert in each of these different scenarios?"

(01:04:18):
And understandably, they were kind of like, "Oh, you know what? I don't know exactly." I'm like, "Let's, just work through it. We don't have to be precise. It's called impact estimation, not impact getting perfect number." So for one of them, they were like, "Well, we can do this landing page." I'm like, "Okay, well how many people hit the landing page?" And they were like, "Not that many, maybe a few hundred." I'm like, "Okay, cool. So that's maybe a few hundred."

(01:04:43):
And there was one thing which they were really reluctant. It had a high effort score and a medium certainty score. And what they basically said was like, "Look, if we really wanted to do this, we could redesign the entire onboarding experience. We can make it so that rather than us trying to retroactively shuttle people into multi-product usage, we can understand them when they join and get them into the right category of user right away."

(01:05:08):
I'm like, "That sounds amazing." What's the most impact that could have? They were like, "It would get us all the way there if we did it right, but we'd have to work with these other teams and we'd have to work with marketing. And there are so many dependencies and so many things outside of our control that we don't know if we could do it." And I said, "That's okay. These are the trade-offs we make as product managers, you will have some things to work on that are going to have less impact, but might be easier and more certain to deliver. But if this thing could get us all the way there, if it's really the only thing we're looking at, which has really any chance of getting us to our goal, which remember we came up with to answer the question, what does this team need to deliver to be a good investment for the business, then I think it's worth going for it.

(01:05:55):
"It's worth having those conversations with other product teams. It's worth talking to folks in marketing. It's worth stretching ourselves a little bit and saying, 'This is going to be challenging to do, but if we can do it, we can really deliver on something which we're going to feel great about.'"

(01:06:11):
So the way that third step manifests itself the most frequently, tactically is are we estimating and measuring impact in the same unit of measure as our goals? Because if we're doing that, then we're keeping ourselves honest and we're saying, "Does this actually have a chance of contributing?" Whereas again, if we get really clever and we come up with a proprietary scoring system and all these little intermediate steps, we can feel like we're doing really awesome work and being very, very terribly smart. But we again, run the risk that we are going to lose our connection with why we're setting about to do this work in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):
Such an important and often easily overlooked point. This idea that when you're doing RICE or whatever version of ICE that you do, that impact should be based on impact to your goal, which is one level removed from the company goal. It feels so obvious as you talk about it, and I hope most people know this, but I feel like that's something people forget. Just like, what is impact? Oh yeah, customers will be happier.

Matt LeMay (01:07:16):
Again, this is not easy work, right? Working in product means that we have so many different perspectives, so many different folks who have so many different priorities. The stakeholder management piece of this is relentless and exhausting, and it's really, really easy to lose sight of this stuff. And it takes work and discipline and as you said, bravery to keep bringing it back. But I think again, it is not only the right thing to do, but it helps you at the end of the day, have a little bit more of a boundary between the work you're doing at your job and the stuff you're good at in your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:58):
Speaking of boundaries, a lot of the advice you share will involve people saying no, and pushing back, and convincing people they're wrong, which is very hard. That's not a natural happy place for most people.

Matt LeMay (01:08:12):
Nope.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):
What advice do you have? What have you learned works well for pushing back, helping people see how they're not... What they want you to build is wrong.

Matt LeMay (01:08:24):
So this is where I have the benefit, I suppose, of being a conflict-averse, people pleaser. So I've been through this, and I think the thing I am proudest of saying in product management and practice is that if you're doing product management really well, you never have to say yes and you never have to say no. You're giving people options and you're helping them understand the trade-offs.

(01:08:52):
So in keeping with this idea that there are things outside of your control, as a product manager, you're not always going to be the one who makes the decision. There are going to be other people who come to you and say, "Build this," or who say, "I don't see the value in that. Do this, do that. I want this, I want that." If those people are in a position of formal authority in the organization, I've certainly never had luck telling them no.

(01:09:16):
Furthermore, I've found myself in situations where they just know things that I don't know. Where they're pursuing an acquisition, so there are certain things that we have to do or can't do. Where there's some serious financial challenge that they're working their way through right now, which is shifting around priorities, but they are not at liberty to discuss that with the broader organization. It is quite possible that the folks who are asking you to do things that don't make sense, have access to information that you don't. And that in trying to convince them otherwise, you are not only going to fail, but you are going to lose some of that trust and degrade that relationship that could in time be really important for you. So I think the challenge is to say, "All right, you want me to build this thing? Maybe. Let's look at the different things."

(01:10:15):
If you're going through these steps, if you say, "I understand, here's what our team's goals are, here's the stuff we're prioritizing, here's the impact we think it could have." If you're coming to me with something which is going to have more impact, heck yeah, I would love to build that. That sounds amazing.

(01:10:29):
But if it has an unclear impact or if it doesn't tie into this, then we might need to adjust the impact we're seeking to have. If this is suddenly really important, as with that story that was told in the book, right? Sometimes it's like, all right, we got to do this. Sure. That means that our impact projection is going to have to be adjusted this much.

(01:10:48):
You're not saying no, you're not saying yes. You're helping someone who is in a position to make a decision, understand the trade-offs that go into that decision. And again, if you can do that, you're going to go home at the end of the day feeling better. You're going to feel less like you lost a battle or that you were overridden by an unjust tyrant, and it's going to be more like, "Okay, I made sure they had all the information I would want to have if I were making that decision. That decision is ultimately theirs to make, and I'm going to do the best I can."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:19):
Tell me if you disagree. In my experience, you also want to recommend a path. Because a lot of people don't want PMs just, "Here's all the options. I have no opinion, no bias of any kind. You decide." I find that people want you to have a perspective.

Matt LeMay (01:11:33):
Absolutely. Options and a recommendation is kind of the magic formula. I did when I was working with MailChimp, we actually did a workshop with all the product managers at the company where we had people roleplay trying to sell in a single option versus multiple options with a recommendation. And it was amazing how when you present a single option, people's instinct is just to, well, I don't know, you start poking holes in it. Not because you're a jerk, but because-

Matt LeMay (01:12:00):
You start poking holes in it, not because you're a jerk, but because you're looking at one thing and you're like, "Oh, well, what about this? What about that?"

(01:12:07):
Again, all of your own anxieties and fears and the things that you don't feel represented in there, and where you're worried, "What if this happens? What if that happens?"

(01:12:14):
All of that kind of detracts from the momentum, whereas if you come in and say, "Here are three options, here are the trade-offs, here's the one we recommend," then every little bit of back and forth makes those options clearer and stronger.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:30):
I feel like people might miss that nuance, in the way we talked about it, so I think that's a really important point to make there.

(01:12:35):
Let me come back to the three steps, just for folks that are, "Cool, I'm excited, I'm motivated. I'm going to change the way we operate." I'll summarize real quick.

(01:12:44):
So step one is, set team goals close to company goals. Step two is keep impact first at every step. Don't forget, as you're building throughout the year. And then, step three is connect every bit of work back to impact.

Matt LeMay (01:12:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:59):
I think, again, it's important to remind people, this may be hard and annoying, and maybe things are going fine. Everyone's telling you what to build, you're building and shipping, and things are, it seems to be going all right.

(01:13:11):
I think an important part of this is just, if you believe what you're building is not helping the business grow and succeed, either, they'll let you go someday, because you're not doing something that matters. Or the business will not work out, and you'll be in trouble.

(01:13:27):
So it's like, even if you don't want to do this something, you need to really seriously think about this, even though it's really hard.

Matt LeMay (01:13:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):
But maybe let me just think of that a little bit. Say the business is doing great, everything's great. The CEO's telling you all the things to build, that sales guys and girls are just like, "Here, ship these features, everything's great."

(01:13:46):
And everything's working, business is growing. What thoughts there? Is it just, "Nah, leave it alone?" Or is your sense, "Okay, most often this will not last," and you should really start to work on these skills?

Matt LeMay (01:13:56):
It's funny, the teams I've worked with, when things are going well, are sometimes just as anxious as the teams I've worked with, when things are going poorly, because they have a hard time attributing success to what they're doing, right?

(01:14:08):
They'll look at it and they'll say, "Yeah, we're doing great. But I think that honestly has more to do with marketing than it does with us."

(01:14:14):
Or, "Yeah, we're doing great, but we're just in the right place at the right time. Our business is doing really well, our sector is doing really well. We're just growing along with everyone else who's growing."

(01:14:24):
And I think, as with most things, if you approach it with curiosity, there's a lot to learn from it. So if you look at it, and you say, "Yeah, we can't necessarily take sole credit for this, but Marketing's doing awesome. Let's talk to them. What are they doing? Why is this going so well? What have they learned from this, that we can work with them more closely?"

(01:14:46):
If your sector is just doing really well, be like, okay, well what about this is working right now? What might change in the future? How can we understand this?"

(01:14:54):
So I think the challenge, when things are going well, is to keep that curiosity going, and to keep celebrating the things, not just that your team is doing, but that everyone is doing, and to take that time, where you have a little bit more leeway, where there's less pressure on you in the moment, to build those connections with other parts of the organization, to see where that really good work is happening.

(01:15:21):
One thing that makes me sad is when teams look upon each other with envy and disgust, right, when it's, "This team's doing, they're doing great work, but they're not held to the same standards that we are, and it's not fair, and they're the team that everyone likes."

(01:15:37):
It's like, "Go talk to them, because there's probably something you can learn from them. And if they're the team that's getting positive attention, that's doing meaningful work, there's probably a reason for that. And if you can understand that reason, and you can align your work, that team's work, that's probably going to be really good for you."

(01:15:58):
Again, I think, in a lot of cases, it comes back down to that control thing, right? If we can't feel a sense of control over, "Things are going well because we did this," we tend to disconnect ourselves from things going well and say, "Well, I can't. It almost feels dangerous to engage with it because, what if we didn't do anything, but good things are still happening."

(01:16:21):
And I think, just keeping that openness, keeping that curiosity going, puts you in a much better position for when things inevitably begin to either plateau or decline, which is the cyclical nature of all things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):
Wow. Profound there. To start to wrap up our conversation, what's maybe one question from the book, or even from this conversation, that you think product leaders, product teams should ask themselves to help them solve problems, that maybe they're not seeing, and to help their team operate better?

Matt LeMay (01:16:53):
I mean, I love the, "Would you fund this team, if you were the CEO question?" I know that that can feel a little confrontational sometimes. So, a gentler way of bringing that up is to say, "What's one sentence you'd want to be able to say at the end of this year, that would leave you feeling awesome about this team's work? What's something?"

(01:17:11):
At the end of the year, everything went really well for this team. You run into the CEO in the hallway, and you say, "I feel awesome, because we did this." '.

(01:17:20):
And you'll sometimes get very different answers from different people on the team, building on those answers, saying, "Okay, this is what you care about. This is what I care about. This is what I'm worried about. This is what I'm excited about."

(01:17:33):
That's how you get that magical, people in a room building together, or musicians in a room writing their next song, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):
What a call, back to the beginning.

Matt LeMay (01:17:40):
And then-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):
I love this.

Matt LeMay (01:17:43):
It's getting that conversation out in the open, and getting people to talk about their perspectives and their expectations, with the goal of bringing it together, to create something better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:55):
Bam. Matt, is there anything else that you wanted to cover or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Matt LeMay (01:18:03):
I think we covered it. I just leave people with, again, this hope that you can start to see the commercial realities and constraints of your business as opportunities, as guideposts, as things that shape and structure your work, not as things that you single-handedly need to change, or break down, or transform, because you probably can't. And that's okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:31):
That's empowering stuff. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Matt LeMay (01:18:37):
As ready as I'm going to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:39):
Question one. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Matt LeMay (01:18:43):
Radical Focus, by Christina Wodtke, is obviously, I cite it a lot in my book, I think it's the best book about OKRs. I love her style of writing. I love the way she tells stories.

(01:18:56):
I love the focus on focus, this idea that again, the way you do it is less important than the result of the way of doing it. I just find that so inspiring, always.

(01:19:08):
The other book, this is a bit of a curveball, is by Alan Watts, the Buddhist philosopher. It's called The Wisdom of Insecurity. And a lot of the way I talk about control, and giving up control, comes from that book.

(01:19:23):
It also has a concept. It opens with a concept called the law of reverse effort, which is that sometimes, the harder you try, the worse you make things. When it comes to setting goals, doing OKRs, doing strategy, I think about this a lot, that there is a tendency sometimes to put effort towards the overcomplication of things, which in turn makes those things less effective, what they're ultimately intended to achieve. So, highly recommend that book. It helped me a lot through some dark times, mentally.

(01:19:59):
There's an idea in the book. He talks about how trying to keep yourself perpetually safe in an imagined future is effectively killing yourself to the present. And ooh, that hit hard. That hit me really, really, really hard. So, highly recommend that book.

(01:20:18):
If the things we've talked about today make you even a fraction of, as anxious and fearful as they make me when I navigate them in my work, then I highly recommend The Wisdom of Insecurity, by Alan Watts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:32):
I was going to ask what the title is, because that sounds really powerful. Amazing, amazing pick.

(01:20:37):
Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Matt LeMay (01:20:41):
God. So especially, when I'm in work-y write-y mode, my brain shuts off to all things that are not trash. So I have been watching a lot of trash.

(01:20:53):
I watched Temptation Island, the new season of Temptation Island on Netflix. I loved it so much. It's Mark L. Wahlberg, who is the host of Antiques Roadshow, just weaponizing therapyspeak to torture people, in this bizarre scenario.

(01:21:15):
And I should not love it, but I am only a human, and a messy bitch who lives for the drama, sometimes, so ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):
So good.

Matt LeMay (01:21:26):
I know. I enjoyed that very much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:27):
I think it's the first Temptation Island call-out, and I love it. Okay, favorite product or ... Yeah, favorite product you've recently discovered, that you really love?

Matt LeMay (01:21:37):
Yeah, so I'm really glad you asked this question, because as a musician, I live in this world of niche products, which is so much fun, because the economies of scale for music creators are just totally different, right?

(01:21:48):
You don't need to build a product that's going to have a billion users, and create a huge return. You can do something that a few hundred or a few thousand people get a lot of use out of and love. You're in this fun realm of hybrid, physical and digital, and different types of things. And when you asked me this question, the first thing that came to mind was this, which is made by an amplifier builder who goes by Milkman Sound, in the San Francisco Bay area, who took, basically, the circuit of a Fender amplifier, and made a version of it that fits into this handy, compact, lightweight form factor.

(01:22:35):
So for me, as somebody who is no longer 22 years old, and still occasionally tours with my friend's band, and has back problems, the fact that I can carry this really powerful amplifier around, in this really well-designed, aesthetically pleasing form factor, just feels like such a joy. It's one of those products that really understands what quality means to its particular audience.

(01:23:09):
And I can go on tour, and have things sound really nice, without having to lug a giant, heavy thing. And I love that. It's something for which I am truly grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:24):
This makes me want to play music randomly, but just so I understand how this works, do you still plug that into a speaker, or is that-

Matt LeMay (01:23:30):
Yeah, so I have a little speaker.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:32):
Okay. Oh, okay.

Matt LeMay (01:23:32):
You can also plug direct into the soundboard at a club, or for recording.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:36):
Okay, got it.

Matt LeMay (01:23:37):
And it has a little headphone jack, too. So if I want to practice in the hotel room, before you play, I can also use this.

(01:23:45):
It does everything you would need this device to do, and nothing more, and it does it really well. And that is so delicious to me, to have a product-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):
Another great pick.

Matt LeMay (01:24:01):
... that I'm like, "This does exactly what I need. It does it so well, and it's a delightful product."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:11):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work, or in life?

Matt LeMay (01:24:17):
I come back to something my mom told me. I'm sure you've experienced this, too. When you're a person creating things in the world, there's a tendency to look at the numbers, and look at, "How am I doing? And did this resonate? Is this good? Did this work?"

(01:24:31):
And I've definitely worked on things, especially in my musical life, where the amount of effort and love, and time and care that went into something, didn't feel like it showed up in the result of that thing, or the way it was received.

(01:24:48):
I was talking to my mom about this once, and she said, "I really believe that no good work is wasted. Even if you don't see it right away, when you put good work out into the world, even if it only finds a few people, it's never wasted. If you do work you really believe in, it's going to have some positive effect on the world."

(01:25:10):
And that really stuck with me. I've carried that with me, even when I think about how to write, and what to say, and when I start to worry about outsmarting myself, and should I be more strategic in the way I message this, and should I say something I don't really totally believe?

(01:25:34):
There've been a few times, not recently, but a few times, 10 years ago, where I dabbled in writing click bait-y headlines, because I was like, "Ooh, is this going to get more attention?" And there was one in particular, that got really thoughtful critique from some people I really respect.

(01:25:49):
I was like, "I don't want to do this. I don't want to put work I don't believe in out into the world," and even if it doesn't do what I hoped it would do, I'm going to go forth with the belief that no good work has wasted.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:03):
I totally believe that. Final question. You wrote a ton of music reviews over the years. I'm curious if there's one that was just very, people super disagreed with it, or just one that you're super proud of?

Matt LeMay (01:26:19):
I mean, I am a villain, in certain corners of the internet-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):
Say more.

Matt LeMay (01:26:23):
... for the review I wrote of Liz Phair's self-titled album. I wrote this review when I was 19, when my worldview was toxic, and very much in progress. It was a really condescending, arrogant review, written from a place of unearned condescension and arrogance.

(01:26:46):
Not that condescension and arrogance should necessarily be earned, but it felt righteous at the time, in a way that is dangerous, right? That toxic righteousness where you're like, "I'm fighting something bad." But then you realize that what you're fighting is not actually bad.

(01:27:09):
You're actually punching sideways and down, but you don't have the wherewithal and the maturity to realize that you are not where you think you are, in relation to people and culture, and yourself. So I apologized for that review in 2019, and Liz Phair and I actually had a really nice little Twitter back and forth.

(01:27:34):
This was back when Twitter was still a place where this kind of thing could happen, and it was nice to wrap that up in that way. I still don't feel good about it, because it was playing into some really toxic and hurtful dimensions of discourse.

(01:28:06):
But what can you do, if not look back on it and say, "Yeah, I was wrong. I was just flat-out wrong, and beyond being wrong, I was being a jerk." Somebody posted this, a meme creator on Instagram, posted that review a couple months ago, with a caption, " Matt LeMay, you will be dealt with."

(01:28:31):
And I was like, "Yeah, yeah. If I read that now, I would probably say something pretty similar." So I think, as I said, I'm a conflict averse people pleaser.

(01:28:48):
I went through my kind of edgelord phase. And I don't think it did any good for me, or for anyone else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):
Wow. That was a much more profound answer than I expected. I can't believe people are still referencing this review from a long time ago. How many years? How ...

Matt LeMay (01:29:08):
22? It was 2003, so it was 22 years ago. It was more than half my life ago. But this is the wild thing, is that on the internet, it still looks new.

(01:29:19):
The first talk I ever gave, in London, actually, was at a Red Monk event, and I brought my teenage diary with me, to make the point that if something has 10 years of age on it as paper, it's contextualized by its own material existence, right?

(01:29:36):
But somebody will go, "Oh, I wonder what Pitchfork thought of this record," they'll see my jerk-ass review, and be, "Pitchfork published this jerk-ass review. Who was the jerk-ass reviewer who wrote it?"

(01:29:48):
And they'll find me, and be like, "Hey, you, you're a jerk-ass, because you wrote this jerk-ass review." And I'll be like, "Yes, I did write that jerk-ass review, from the place of being a jerk-ass." But I like to think I am a person who has lived 22 years of life since then.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:11):
Your frontal cortex has developed more since then. I think it doesn't stop-

Matt LeMay (01:30:13):
God, I hope so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:14):
Until 25, 26. Matt, this was awesome. We covered so much ground. We've touched on everything I was hoping to, and more.

(01:30:22):
Two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online, talk about the sort of work you do with companies, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt LeMay (01:30:29):
Yeah, so you can find me online at matlemay.com, pretty straightforward, and in terms of how folks can be useful to me, hopefully I can be useful to them, whether that's through the books, or through coming into work with your company, and help your teams focus.

(01:30:47):
I find that facilitating these conversations is a really big value add. It's hard to have these conversations to do this without some outside help sometimes. So again, whether it's in book form or in me form, I hope that I can be useful to you, and having these conversations in a way that's less scary, more accessible, and leads you down that road to doing impactful work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:11):
Awesome, and mattlemay.com. And then, what's the name of the book? Where do they find it

Matt LeMay (01:31:15):
Impact-First Product Teams. You can find it at all the places where you find books, on Amazon. There's an author read audiobook, which I recorded right here in this room, with this microphone. I did all the musical interludes myself ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:28):
Why?

Matt LeMay (01:31:30):
Because it was a great way to procrastinate, when I did not actually want to read the book. But I hope you will find it fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:39):
Matt, thank you so much for being here.

Matt LeMay (01:31:41):
Thanks so much, Lenny. This was great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:43):
