# $46B of hard truths: Why founders fail and why you need to run toward fear | Ben Horowitz (a16z)

## Transcript

Ben Horowitz (00:00:00):
The worst thing that you do as a leader is you hesitate on the next decision. The thing that causes you to hesitate is both decisions are horrible. Probably one of my bigger ones on that was we went public with $2 million in trailing 12 months revenue at 18 months old. That's obviously a bad idea. But the truth of it was the alternative was going bankrupt, and that's a worse idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
It's a very difficult and painful to be a CEO, to be a founder. In spite of that. So many people want to start companies.

Ben Horowitz (00:00:29):
The psychological muscle you have to build to be a great leader is to be able to click in the abyss and go, "Okay, that way's slightly better. We're going to go that way. If everybody agrees with the decision, then you didn't add any value because they would've done that without you." So the only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
You are famous for writing one of the most popular pieces of literature for product managers.

Ben Horowitz (00:00:52):
What I was trying to get out in Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager, was the job is fundamentally a leadership job. And it's a tricky leadership job because nobody is actually reporting to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:06):
There's always this kind of sense that the PM is not the mini CEO. How dare you call yourself that? I actually think that's exactly what the PM is.

Ben Horowitz (00:01:12):
It doesn't matter if you write a good, spec or you have a good interview or you do this or do that. What matters is that the product works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:21):

(00:04:13):
Ben, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Ben Horowitz (00:04:17):
All right, thank you Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:19):
I'm even more excited to have you here.

(00:04:21):
I want to start with a question that a close friend of yours suggested I ask you, Shaka Senghor. So Shaka, he's, we could do an hour just on how interesting this guy and the things he's done.

Ben Horowitz (00:04:32):
Three hours on Joe Rogan that day. He is very-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):
So we're not going to do that. Just to give a glimpse, he was in prison for 19 years. He was in solitary for seven years. He led a huge prison gang. You wrote about him in your book as a great exemplar of great culture in the prison gang that he ran. So interesting. But something that he learned from you that he told me I need to ask you about is about success and how to be successful and how it's not what people think. And he said that you learned this lesson from a pilot. What is that story? What is that lesson?

Ben Horowitz (00:05:08):
I mean, I would say it's a long life lesson. But the pilot story is I actually, I ask people silly questions sometimes when they meet them. And so I met this gentleman who was a pilot and it was right around the time JFK Jr. crashed his airplane and ultimately died. And I asked him, I was like, "What happened?" Because there's always the story in the press, and I know this from them writing about me or anything, is it's always what's the best narrative not what's true. So you can never actually find out what happened, you just find the best story version of what happened.

(00:05:53):
And the story in the press was all about, "Oh, he wasn't trained on instrumentation was flying at night." And I wanted to know is that right? And the pilot said, "Well," he said, "really, it's like all plane crashes are a series of bad decisions. And none of the decisions by themselves is that bad, but when you add them up, it's bad."

(00:06:14):
So the first decision was he needed to get wherever he was going and that was the priority. And in flying, that can't ever be the priority because there are conditions, there are things that happen. And then the second one was, "Well, his timing of when the sun would go down was wrong." So he thought he'd be flying in sunlight and he wasn't. And then once he got up there, it was when the plane was going down making it go up was a bad decision because he was upside down. And so it was like, I can't remember all the things, but this guy had 17 bad decisions in a row. And the big thing for me that I felt was really true is it's one decision leads to another. And so if you can break psychologically, you can take the sunk cost, then that gets you out of a lot of bad paths. And then a little good decision may be difficult, but you have to believe it's going to lead to the next one. And a lot of success is about that. It's a small thing, a small thing that's hard to do that doesn't seem to have a high impact, but it leads to the next small hard to do thing and then eventually you get an outcome, so that was kind of the concept.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:46):
So the lesson there is just success is just a bunch of little things. It's not this, "Cool, I got here in a big thing."

Ben Horowitz (00:07:52):
If somebody were to write a story about me, they would be like, "Then Ben this really smart thing and blah, blah, blah, happy ending." But it really wasn't like that and I don't think it's like that for you or anybody. And I spent a lot of time with Shaka on how, because it's always your own psychology that gets you. And one of the most insightful things he said to me is, because most people who are in solitary for seven years, that's it. You're insane. You're never coming back from that. It's just an impossible thing. But if you study his story, he actually really was massively self-improved coming out of solitary, and he wouldn't recommend that for anybody, just to be clear. It wasn't solitary. But what it was was he changed, in solitary he was able to change a big set of beliefs that he had about himself that got him out of that.

(00:08:50):
And the thing that his conclusion from it, which I thought was really interesting, he's like, "Look, was in prison for 19 years. I was in solitary for seven. I come out, I can't rent an apartment, I can't vote, I can't get a gun, I can't do, no rights. None of that was anything compared to what I did to myself."

(00:09:08):
And I think that's very true for CEOs in general and people in general is all the things that you perceive that are happening to you that are bad, be it the systems against you or somebody undercuts you or racism or sexism or this or that or the other is very small compared to ... It means a lot if you believe it. If you believe what people say about you, if you believe what they did to you, then that destroys you. But if you go, "That's not me," you can overcome almost anything. And he's got a new book out on that anyway that I think is very good because that's the, I'd say more than anything, that's the key to success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:52):
If you look at all the writing you've done, it's essentially about the struggle and pain and suffering of being a CEO, your first [inaudible 00:09:59] to Hard Thing About Hard Things. There's a lot of talk these days about just how important struggle is and how valuable it is to go through struggle. Jensen's big on this. He talks a lot about just you have to go through pain and suffering to be a great leader.

Ben Horowitz (00:10:12):
You don't really have a choice. That's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:15):
There's something that I saw you share that I love, which is running towards fear versus running away from fear. Something that you tell all your leaders to work on. Easy to hear, hard to do. We don't like doing things that are scary, running towards things that are scary. Why is this so important? Why is this something people need to learn to do?

Ben Horowitz (00:10:33):
Well, so the biggest mistake that you make, the worst thing that you do as a leader, there's things in your control and there's things out of your control and hesitation, that's generally the most destructive. And I go through all the ways that it's destructive, but it's extremely bad. And the thing that causes you to hesitate is both decisions are horrible. It's that business school where you're going through a case study, "And if you had done that, then the company would have gone this way. But if you had done that, it's a great success." That's not actually what happens to you as CEO.

(00:11:16):
What happens to as CEO, it's like, "Okay, if we rearchitect, this product, the architecture is not actually get us to where we need to go. I kind of know that. But if we rearchitect it, we're going to probably miss all the features, miss the quarter, have trouble raising money, shudder, et cetera. So that's really bad. And then not rearchitecting is really bad, and so I'm just going to try to and avoid this subject because I don't even want to deal with either of those." And that's the worst thing, because if action is the better choice and that's good. And then if you don't make an explicit decision, then the whole company's going to get nervous because they know that the architecture is whack and you got to fix it.

(00:12:07):
And probably one of my bigger ones on that was we went public with $2 million in trailing 12 months revenue at 18 months old. That's obviously a bad idea. I mean, there's no question that wasn't a bad idea. But the truth of it was the alternative because of where the private markets were was going bankrupt. And that's a worse idea.

(00:12:34):
And if you look at that time, March of 2001 when we went public, you just look at the number of CEOs that hesitated on that and didn't do it and went bankrupt. It's a lot. And so that getting good at making a decision that everybody's going to go, "Wow, that was insane, Ben." The Wall Street Journal wrote a whole long story about how stupid I was. And then Businessweek wrote a story called the IPO From Hell. That was the name of our idea, the IPO from hell, which was accurate in a sense.

(00:13:13):
So that's really bad, but it wasn't as bad, and this is why it's so scary you make that decision that's going to happen. I knew those stories would get written, there was no question. And yeah, that's the kind of muscle. So if you think about the psychological muscle you have to build to be a great leader is to be able to look in the abyss and go, "Okay, that way slightly better. We're going to go that way. And it's very hard to do." I would say it's a thing people struggle with. And it began something, should I fire the head of sales? So I don't want to have that conversation. And then I'll have to replace them. And then there's going to be a bad PR story. And you can kind of quickly calculate all the bad stuff that's going to happen if you do it. But if you don't do it, that's probably going to be much worse and that's why you have to run towards the pain in darkness.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:13):
What is the advice you share with founders? Because as you said, it's very hard to do this, just what helps them actually get better at this? Is it just Ben being by their side telling them this is how it is? Is there anything else you can share?

Ben Horowitz (00:14:23):
No, no. I would say this is one where I can't really coach you to be good at this. I can point it out so that you recognize that you were slow or whatever. But it's kind of like I always liken when I talk to them, it's like football. You can have a really fast great athlete, but if they don't trust their eyes, if they don't run to the ball when they see it, if they think, "Oh, maybe that was a fake," then they're that step slower and then they'll never be as good. And CEOs are like that. If you don't trust what you see and you don't run at it, then you're just not going to be good. And it's hard to get CEOs not to hesitate. But look, the thing that does help is they look at it and I look at it and I confirm, "No, that is as it appears."

(00:15:23):
And sometimes they're afraid of the conversation. So that one I can help with. So A CEO might be afraid, like they want to do something but they don't know how to say it. They don't know how to have the conversation with the employee so I can walk them through that. I had an instance where the CEO said, "Hey, I need your help, Ben. My CTO, he's an asshole." And I was like, "Okay, great." I said, "But you're not going to fire him because I know he's a good CTO, or are you asking me should you fire him?" He said, "No, no, I don't want to fire him." And I was like, "So you're asking me what to do? You don't know how have that conversation with him about being an without him quitting. That's what you're saying?" And he goes, "Yeah, that's the problem."

(00:16:09):
And so I go, "Well, why is he an asshole?" And he says, "Well, he's an asshole because the other day he made a very junior young woman in our finance organization cry." And I was like, "Yeah, I got you." I said, "Look, this is what I would say to him. I'd say I just sit them down and I would say, 'Look, you're a really good director of engineering because you do a great job at managing the team, get the products out, all that. But you're not really a CTO because to be a CTO, you have to be effective with other parts of the organization. You can't just be effective only with engineering. And making somebody cry, she's never going to do anything you want. You lost all effectiveness with all of finance by doing that. And so if you want to get good at that, I'll help you. I'll work with you on it, but if you don't, I'm going to have to hire a CTO at some point because obviously I need that.'" And then he was like, "Oh, okay, I can have that conversation. I can't have the conversation that, 'Hey, you're an asshole,' because I don't want them to quit, but I can have the conversation that's more specific." And a lot of getting people not to hesitate is just getting them over that.

(00:17:20):
And so often, and I would say early in a CEO's career, a lot of it is just not knowing how to have the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):
There's also I imagine an element of I just want to be liked. I don't want people to hate me. You have this great line that you want to be liked and respected in the long run, not the short run.

Ben Horowitz (00:17:37):
Yeah, that's tricky. By the way, I have to deal with this in the firm too, and people want to be entrepreneur friendly. I'm like, "No, it's not friendly. Respectful. But you've got to be able to tell them the truth in a way that you probably don't tell most of your friends the truth." Because your friend, look anthropologically, we want people to like us. It's just so they don't throw us to the lion or whatever. That's just kind of a thing. So you say tell people what they want to hear, but in dealing at a company level in a context of you're on the board of somebody's company, you've got to be able to tell them what they don't want to hear. That's the most important thing you're going to say.

(00:18:22):
And yes, they're not going to like it when you say it, there's no question. But over time it could save the company. And all the most important things I've said are things that I've said to CEOs that they did not want to hear. And that's what the leadership is about. If everybody agrees with the decision, then you didn't add any value because they would've done that without you. So the only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like and that's where leadership comes in because you know that's where it's got to get to. And that's the thing that takes practice.

(00:19:05):
I think when Jensen talks about luck, you've got to get to near death to get yourself to do that. That's true. It's hard to build that if everything's going great. And I would say the CEOs who had an easy run of it for their, let's say, they just launched a product that's an instant hit, it's very hard for them to develop that muscle compared to the ones that built a company like Jensen where he gutted it out for multiple decades before they had big success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:36):
Clearly, it's very difficult and painful to be a CEO, to be a founder. In spite of that so many people want to start companies. So many people dream of having their own company. Who is not right to start a company? What advice do you share with folks that are thinking about starting a company that may not understand just what they're about to get into?

Ben Horowitz (00:19:57):
Yeah, so it's funny. So there's a couple of things. John Reed, who was the CEO of Citigroup when I started as CEO, said to me something I never forget. He said, "Ben, the only reason to start a company is because you have an irrational desire to do so, because it's not worth the money." And I was like, "Wow, he doesn't even quantify how much money and this guy's running Citigroup." So he is a very numbers, banking guy and he didn't quantify it. And I remember when we sold LoudCloud for $1.6 billion, I remember thinking, "Wow, that wasn't worth the money whatsoever."

(00:20:37):
So I think if you're doing it for the money, that's a very bad reason and it will be extremely difficult to get you an outcome. You really have to have an irrational desire to do something larger than yourself to improve the world in some way that somehow that is your purpose. And if you don't feel that, then you'll never get through it. It's just too many bad things happen along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:08):
So then how do you think of founders that are looking around for ideas that brainstorm, that look for market opportunities versus come from, "I have this a mission, I've got to do this thing in the world."

Ben Horowitz (00:21:19):
My business partner Mark always talks about that. So if you have a product that forces you to build a company, that is a great case of it, right? Okay, you built something and the world wants it and you need a company to deliver it, you know, already have the right product. And so that's very helpful.

(00:21:37):
I think there are cases of people, I think Hewlett-Packard was built that way, that they're like, "Okay, we've got to build technology," it was that abstract, "We've got built in technology for the world." And then they started with, "Well, what do you need?" They called it the next bench thing. What does the engineer sitting next to me need? The next engineer on the bench? So how they define the first set of products.

(00:22:03):
So it can work the other way, but I think the thing that is in common is it's just a very abstract idea that you have to build something that's going to be important that people are going to like working there, people are going to benefit from the products. You have to have some weird concept other than, "Oh, this is going to be successful and I'm going to make a lot of money." I think way better off taking Zuck's offer at Meta and just doing that. That's a way better deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):
Along these lines, something else Shaka suggested I ask you about, apparently there's a story where the CEO of Databricks asked you for $200,000 in the early days and you said no. And it's not because you didn't want to invest and it was more about helping them think bigger. What happened there?

Ben Horowitz (00:22:55):
So there were six of them, they were six HD student, well, and Jan Stoicka (phonetic) who was their professor. And Jan was this super genius, but when I met with them, they were like, "We need to raise $200,000." And I knew at the time that what they had was this thing called Spark and the competitor was something called Hadoop. And Hadoop had very well-funded companies already running towards it and Spark was open source, so the clock was ticking.

(00:23:39):
And I think they didn't quite know what they had. And then there's also a thing always, although I wouldn't say Jan has this mentality, but professors in general it's a pretty big win if you start a company and you make $50 million. You're a hero on campus. That's a pretty cool thing to have done. And so I'm always a little nervous about a company that comes out of academia thinking too small anyway.

(00:24:09):
And so I said, "Look, I'm not going to write you a check for $200,000. I'll write you a check for $10 million because this company, you need to build a company. You need to really go for it if you're going to do this, otherwise you guys should stay in school." And they were all graduating right then, so that was kind of that. And Ali actually was VP of engineering at the time, and it was a while before I made him CEO and that was very good luck on my part because I had no idea that they had a guide that good inside the company who could become CEO when I invested. That was just, God smiled on me and gave me that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):
So speaking of Ali, I actually asked him what to ask you about, and he immediately shared this story. I don't know if you remember this. In your first one-on-one with him, after you-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
I don't know if you remember this. In your first one-on-one with him, after you made him CEO, he was struggling with a bunch of low performers because he was coming in to lead the company and he was trying to turn things around, trying to coach them, trying to level them up. And your advice to him was quote, "You don't make people great. You find people that make you great, that make the company great, that you learned from, not the other way around." And there's something that he called managerial leverage. What is that all about? What's the lesson there?

Ben Horowitz (00:25:27):
Oh yeah, yeah. So understand, he had just become CEO. So I was teaching him, he had been VP of Engineering and CEO is different. And I'll get into why and what I mean by leverage.

(00:25:40):
So I actually wrote a post about this with a little Wang quote where I think the quote was, "The truth is hard to swallow and hard to say too but I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school." And that was always my feeling about this particular idea was, look, if you're VP of engineering, you can develop people. You can teach them to be better engineers. You can teach them, be better engineering managers. That's very doable.

(00:26:08):
But if you're a CEO, what do you know about being CFO? Like what do you know about being VP, HR? What do you know about any of these jobs except maybe VP of engineering?

(00:26:22):
And so the idea that you're going to take somebody who isn't world-class at marketing and make and you them world class and you don't know anything about marketing, is a dumb idea. It just doesn't work.

(00:26:34):
And then the company can't afford for you to be spending time on that because they need you to make very high quality, fast decisions. They need you to set the direction for the company and they need you to have a world-class team. And so it's a very hard lesson if you've been VP of engineering because if you're a good VP of engineering, you do develop your people.

(00:26:55):
But as a CEO, it's not like you don't do any of it, but it is very, very small compared to it. So I like to make things just very stark. So you get what I'm saying? I don't like to hedge it.

(00:27:08):
And then managerial leverage means it is very simple. It's okay. If I have the ideas about what your department should do next. If I am kind of pushing you to kind of move your organization forward, then that's no leverage. What's leverage is if you're telling me what you should do and how you can push the company forward, that's leverage, then I'm getting more than I'd have if you weren't there otherwise I could just manage a team.

(00:27:39):
And that's the point when you feel like you're not getting leverage. When you got to go say, "Hey, why aren't we doing this? Why aren't we doing that?" That's when you got to make a change. And by the way, he's unbelievable at that, as good as anybody I've seen as a guy who's not callous as a CEO. He really cares about the people who work for him. He really wants him to have great careers and all that, but he does not hesitate. If he's losing leverage, he'll make a move.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):
Kind of going back to the origin story of A-Sixteen-Z something you guys were really big on was helping founders stay COs become great COs, not replace them with professional COs.

(00:28:16):
I want to flip this question on you. When does it actually make sense to replace CO? When are people not going to make great COs?

Ben Horowitz (00:28:26):
There's a very consistent thing that happens, which is when somebody doesn't make it and it kind of starts with confidence is the way I would put it.

(00:28:35):
So if you invent a product, you kind of recruit a team so forth, all of a sudden you're CEO, but you don't run a big organization, you don't know how to do that. Most founders are like that. And so, if you don't know what you're doing, you're going to make mistakes and they all make a lot of mistakes. And then when you make those mistakes, they're very expensive. They could cost you to do a down round or they could cost you to lose a company or they could cost you a customer or you scrub the product. They're very high impact and not just on you, but everybody who you talked into joining you. And so that kind of motion can really cause you to lose confidence.

(00:29:20):
And then if you lose confidence, what happens is you hesitate on the next decision. And as we talked about, hesitation is very dangerous because one, it locks up the company, but even worse what happens is if you have senior people working for you, they get very nervous and they feel like they need to jump into that void and make the decision for you. And that's when it gets political, very political, because people are vying for power inside your little screwed up company.

(00:29:57):
And so now you've got a political dysfunctional organization and that's generally where, okay, the founder probably can't run this thing anymore. That's how it happens.

(00:30:11):
So most of what we do as a firm is to try to help people with that confidence problem and there's a whole series of ideas that we have around that, but you kind of have to somehow climb the confidence and the competency curve together. It's very hard to do and particularly if you're an engineer and you're used to getting things right or if you've been a straight A student or something like that, it's very disconcerting. Sometimes it's better to have CEOs who are like C minus students.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Why is that?

Ben Horowitz (00:30:45):
Yeah, a little facetious. Well, it's just good to be used to failing. So I think I wrote this, but the median on the CEO kind of test is like 18. It's not like 90. And so you got to be comfortable getting a lot of D minuses because the D minus is fine, as long as you don't get the F, as long as you don't run out of cash, as long as you don't lose all thing. Okay, you got through it, keep going. And match, that's a lot of the thing that we try to do CEOs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:20):
Yeah, it comes back to your core, I don't know, message through your first book is just how much you'll fail and how much you'll struggle and how much paid you'll go through as CO.

Ben Horowitz (00:31:29):
Yeah, yeah, and I mean a lot of why I wrote that book was just to nanalyze it. I think what happens is, particularly when I wrote it, and I think it's come back and been true now, is the way the narrative gets written on all these successes is like, "Ph, they came up with a genius idea and then they built this company and they hired all these smart people and it was all great." But that's not at all how it happens and I've spent enough time with everybody from Mark Zuckerberg to Sam Altman and so forth, that they all go through that same thing that who has your struggling company go through? You screw a lot of things up and they have massive consequences, but you have to maintain your confidence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
Actually, I was at a storytelling event last night and I was chatting with someone that I ran into there and told her I was chatting with you today, and she said how meaningful your first book was to her as a founder. Exactly as you said, normalizing that it's very hard and painful and this is just the way it is.

Ben Horowitz (00:32:36):
And the feeling, look, if you think about organizational design or goals and objectives or OKRs or whatever management technique, you need a basic eighth grade education to do any of that stuff. It is not that complicated. The difficult part is the feeling that you have when you have to do it is very, the hard thing of matter a reorg is you're redistributing power, so you're going to have people really fricking mad at you because somebody's losing power if you do it correctly. And that person may be a really good employee. Dealing with that is the hard thing. Knowing how the organization should work to make communication better, it's not that complex.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:18):
Yeah, I think about I was at Airbnb for a long time and just thinking of Brian, who I don't know even know if he had a job before Airbnb now.

Ben Horowitz (00:33:25):
Oh yeah. I spent a lot of time with Brian and after COVID, it all kind of clicked for him and then he did that he and that good talk on founder mode and so forth. But the reason that was so articulate is he had screwed every one of those things up and he hired LT and all this stuff, and these are very senior people and he wanted to defer to them, but you can't defer as the CEO because you know what Airbnb should be doing. He may know what finance should do, but you know what Airbnb should do and this kind of thing. And then it gets really wild when you can't defer decisions as the CEO. You got to understand what people are saying and go, "Now we're going to do this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:13):
And this again comes back to the point of you have to go through the struggle and pain and failure to learn those lessons.

Ben Horowitz (00:34:18):
Yeah, no. They're really hard to learn without doing and often without paying the consequence. Even I, like I make mistakes. I was having conversation with Ali the other day and I was like, he's like, "How's it going Ben?" And I was like, "Well, I'm finally dealing with something that I had put off for a very long time." And he said, "Why'd you put it off?" I said, "Because things were going too good. I didn't have to deal with it. "And he was like, "Yeah." He said, "I know that." I'd say Ali is one of the, if not the kind of best private company CEO out there, and he's making a mistake and I'm making a mistakes. So, it is just tough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):
You said that one of maybe the main reason founders fail the CEOs is they lose confidence, and you had some ideas that you guys have to help founders work through that. Are there a couple you can share how you help?

Ben Horowitz (00:35:12):
Yeah. So we do a lot of things on that. So the kind of design of the firm is about confidence. So the first thing is, well, what would give you? Well if you can get stuff done. So what if I could give you a network that's as good as Bob Iger's network, day one, the day you stepped into the job.

(00:35:31):
And so we have 600 people at the firm and why is that? Well, most of them are building that network for you, so you can call any CEO or anybody in Washington or any executive or that kind of thing and get them on the phone and they'll talk to you and you can kind of deal with that thing. And then that just makes you feel like a CEO.

(00:35:55):
And then we have a lot of people in the firm like myself, who you can talk to on a CEO to CEO basis, as opposed to an investor to CEO, and just kind of feel that. Early in the firm days, we used to do this thing. I think I'm going to bring back in some form this thing called the CEO barbecue. And it was like a lot of people have these events where they bring in speakers and this and that and the other. And I always felt like those were one, they were too many days. And then sometimes what they said wasn't really applicable and that kind of thing.

(00:36:32):
So I said, "Why don't we just have a barbecue?" I would barbecue. We get everybody in my backyard because was 500 people at the peak, which is why at the stuff I couldn't cook that much, that kind of stuff. And then we'd have Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg and Kanye West, and so you're a CEO in there with portfolio. You're like, "Wow, I must be important. I'm here with all these guys" and we're just hanging out having a drink, eating barbecue.

(00:37:04):
And so then when I go back to my company, I feel like I am somebody. And okay, I might not be perfect at all this, but I am really a CEO. I was at the CEO barbecue, for crying out loud and that kind of thing. But the whole idea was always like, "Okay, do you feel like you can do it?" Because that's half the battle?

(00:37:29):
And look, having been in and every CEO has been in a position where they feel like, "Well, maybe I shouldn't be the one running this thing. Maybe it's just too big for me." And that's a bad, you don't want to go there. And because as we've said, founders can get to the next product and that's something that almost no professional CEO is able to do. There've been rare cases, but very rare.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:57):
So clearly you've worked with a lot of companies, a lot of founders. Let me kind of zoom out a little bit and ask you this question.

(00:38:03):
What's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building companies that goes against common startup wisdom?

Ben Horowitz (00:38:09):
Well, the common startup wisdom keeps changing. One of the early ones that was wrong, and Brian articulated it, and then now I think a little bit of what people have gone to is also wrong.

(00:38:25):
So the first idea that was wrong was like, okay, build a team of senior executives as soon as you get product market fit as fast as possible and they can scale the thing. And I think that you got to build that team slowly and deliberately, kind of pace to your ability to integrate and then manage them. Because if you bring in a bunch of senior people and you don't know really how they match to your company or how that function works or so forth, then you're going to start deferring. And once you start deferring, it's going to get out of control very fast because they're going to build empires, they're going to get political, they're going to do all that kind of thing.

(00:39:08):
So that was bad advice. You kind of have to do it in a measured way. I think that founder mode, I think a lot of people have taken to never hire anybody with experience. And that's also bad advice in that, look, somebody who knows how to do something can really accelerate your thing. So very early on, one of the founders, great founder Arsalan at Databricks was running sales. And I'm like, "Oli, you're going to have to hire somebody who knows sales because Arsalan's, PhD in computer science. I like that, but that's probably not where you're going to have to start if you're going to catch these guys before they take Spark and use it against you."

(00:39:53):
And I sat down with Arsalan and I explained why. I said, "Look, a lot of what sales, there's a lot of knowledge in how to build a worldwide sales organization; maybe knowledge of customers, territories, territory splitting, rep profiles. There's just a litany of stuff that you really can only learn by doing trial and error and you don't know anything. And so you're phenomenal. Let's get you. And still, he's a very senior executive in the company now, but we need somebody who knows that. And the idea that there are companies that go, " Okay, we're just not going to hire that in founder mode." That's also a mistake. So there's a lot of, it's more subtle than you think, and it's more complex than you think. And so you kind of have to get all the way to the truth. And these little snippets of advice that he sees good, because they watch some fucking podcasts, are all fucking stupid.

(00:40:51):
There's a lot of depth to these things. You have to know the answer to the next question, the next question and the next question, and it does drive me crazy. One of the funnier things that happened along these lines, just to show you how little. You know as an investor, about what it means to be CEO.

(00:41:11):
We were at a board dinner. One of the CEOs says to me, he goes, or one of our CEO says, "Hey Ben, that thing you told me a while ago about don't be CEO at home." He said, "I was doing that and I stopped and it really helped me."

(00:41:28):
And then the other kind of VC said, " Yeah. You got to unplug some time." And I said, I was like, "What the fuck are you talking about? He's CEO. He's not unplugging. He's getting shit all the fucking time. He's got to deal with that. That was not what I meant. I was like, you can't go home and boss your family around. That's what I meant."

(00:41:48):
You hear something from somebody who, but if you haven't done it, you don't even know what that means. And so then you then trying to transfer the advice to the next guy, that's not going to work. So anyway, but he was very innocent. I just don't want to kind of speak bad of him, but that's how it sounds, right? But that's not what it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
That's an amazing story. So the advice partly here, is just don't believe everything you see on Twitter and little sound bites of advice.

# Figma’s CEO: Why AI makes design, craft, and quality the new moat for startups | Dylan Field

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02):
Today I am excited to bring you a very special episode, which was recorded live at Figma Config with Figma CEO and co-founder, Dylan Field, in front of a live audience at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. This is the first ever live recording of this podcast and it was so much fun. If you watch this on YouTube, you can see the epic stage that they built specifically for us to recreate my podcast studio. I could not be more thankful to the Config team for making this happen.

(00:28):
In my conversation with Dylan, we dig into how he builds and refines his product taste and intuition, how intuition is a hypothesis generator, the future of product management. How Dylan attempts to operationalize keeping Figma simple and to continue simplifying the experience. A bunch of stories from the early days of Figma that I've never heard before. Also, he shares his favorite AI tool called websim, which is wild. And if you wait till the very end, you can see a very young child actor Dylan Field in a clip that I found online that was hilarious.

(01:00):
If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Dylan Field.

(01:12):
Dylan, thank you so much for joining me and welcome to the podcast.

Dylan Field (01:16):
Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18):
Hi all.

Dylan Field (01:22):
Is this your first live podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24):
This is my first ever live podcast. Also, a big thank you to the Config team who set up this crazy studio. I had no idea this was going to happen. I feel like I'm in my studio here with a thousand people watching us. It's very impressive. I very much dig the background and also the mics that may or may not be wired.

Dylan Field (01:40):
That's right. Don't say that. Don't tell people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42):
Oh, sorry.

Dylan Field (01:44):
There's no wires coming out of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45):
There's no one behind the curtain either. Okay, so Dylan, I want to start by just checking in on how you're doing. So Config is about to wrap up. We've been at it for two days now. I know how much lift goes into doing these sorts of things. I imagine you've been thinking about this for a long time now. I'm just curious how you're doing, any surprises, any highlights, any low lights?

Dylan Field (02:06):
The highlight is the community and just the incredible, incredible people here at Config. Y'all are awesome. I don't know why I keep talking in the mic like this. It's instinctual. But seriously, it's just the most amazing community to be part of and I feel so lucky. And then in terms of how I'm doing at this exact moment, exhausted, but riding on caffeine and whatever this really cool probiotic drink is.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:36):
Any surprises from the past couple of days? Anything that's like, "Oh wow, that went a lot better than I thought, maybe less well."

Dylan Field (02:44):
Demo, definitely things I would've improved. But also Emil and Mihika were phenomenal, and it was just so awesome to see them do their demos and present materials. I was just really pleased with the conversation, I think, that's getting started at Config around AI. I was looking online on social media and I think people are already zeroing in the right conversation, which is, okay, in a world of more software being created by AI, what does that mean and the impact on craft and the impact on quality and the need to have more unique design and how design is a differentiator.

(03:37):
And I think some people are saying, "I agree with that." Some people are saying, "That I disagree with that", and that's exactly the bounds of what the conversation I imagined would emerge from yesterday. It was funny, the make design feature, I think that I said on the keynote, I was like, "This is going to give you the most obvious thing in the most obvious form possible." And then people online are like, "It's just going to give you some obvious thing." I agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:10):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Versal, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(05:28):
This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their Document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one Document SDK.

(06:03):
Most product managers will tell you paperwork sucks. Anvil's Document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered Webform styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's Drag and Drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil.

(06:58):
Let's keep talking about design. You once said that the definition of design is art applied to problem solving. Can you just add a bit more to that? What do you mean by that? Because that's an amazing line.

Dylan Field (07:09):
Well, I don't think it's my original line. I think someone else said it, but there's a lot of definitions of design out there too. There's also 'design is dialogue' or 'design is problem solving'. You just go straight there. I could go with 10 more. But I like art applied to problem solving because I think that design is often... There is some component of creativity to it and unique expression that you're trying to provide and create and put out into the world. But you are also trying to do it and match it to a user need, a problem that needs to be solved. And I think that it's not pure art, but if you lose the art and you're just solving the problem, it's totally utilitarian and it lacks soul. And so the combination of those two things is to me really beautiful.

Lenny Rachitsky (08:03):
I'm going to pivot to a very hard hitting question. I hope your PR people don't kill me for asking this. Many people asked me to ask you this question. Very important. Please explain a Figma tradition called raccoon feet and muffin hands.

Dylan Field (08:21):
I should probably just leave this interview now. So this is a conversation, I'm not sure exactly where it started, but it started in early Figma. And basically we had these lunch tables at Figma where we would just all gather and have very long, interesting meandering conversations before we got back to work. And one of the questions that, was a 'would you rather', was would you rather have raccoons for feet or muffins for hands? And I think this is a deeply philosophical question. I have pondered it since I've heard it. I still don't have one answer. If you've got an answer, I'm curious what it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:02):
I've got follow up questions. Can you control where the raccoon take you or are they just deciding on their own what's happening?

Dylan Field (09:09):
I think that raccoons probably wouldn't even agree with each other where to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:14):
Okay, that's complicated.

Dylan Field (09:16):
If you had raccoons for feet right now, do you think that it would interfere with this podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (09:21):
But muffin hands would also interfere with my newsletter and I feel like I'd be out of work.

Dylan Field (09:25):
I don't know if you can type.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:26):
I'd need a special keyboard. This is very difficult.

Dylan Field (09:29):
You haven't even thought about the upsides of this yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:33):
What are the upsides?

Dylan Field (09:34):
We can get there, it's all-

Lenny Rachitsky (09:36):
Maybe I could eat some of the muffins.

Dylan Field (09:36):
It's the case for optimism.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:37):
Cupcakes?

Dylan Field (09:38):
If you have muffins for hands, maybe if you're hungry...

Lenny Rachitsky (09:41):
Do they regenerate as you you eat them?

Dylan Field (09:43):
That's a good question. There's no answers here, just questions. Do your nails grow?

Lenny Rachitsky (09:49):
Yes.

Dylan Field (09:50):
Oh, okay. Interesting. It's deeper than you might think.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:58):
I'm going to play a short clip with Rick Rubin and then I have a question about it. So we'll see if that plays.

Speaker 3 (10:06):
But exactly what he does and how is difficult to describe. Do you play instruments?

Rick Rubin (10:12):
Barely.

Speaker 3 (10:13):
Do you know how to work a soundboard?

Rick Rubin (10:15):
No. I have no technical ability and I know nothing about music.

Speaker 3 (10:21):
Then you must know something.

Rick Rubin (10:22):
Well, I know what I like and what I don't like. And I'm decisive about what I like and what I don't like.

Speaker 3 (10:29):
So what are you being paid for?

Rick Rubin (10:31):
The confidence that I have in my taste and my ability to express what I feel has proven helpful for artists.

Lenny Rachitsky (10:45):
So I'm not going to say this is you. You need to grow the beard. But I think this is a little bit you because what I've heard from a number of your colleagues is that one of your superpowers is intuition and product taste. And someone said that you have the sixth sense for what's going to work, when you're designing Figma and you're making decisions in the product. So I'm curious how you've built and refined your intuition and product taste when it comes to Figma and then even broadly.

Dylan Field (11:13):
That's a lot kinder than I thought you were going to be. I thought you're going to be like, "You don't know how to code and you don't know how to design."

Lenny Rachitsky (11:17):
No.

Dylan Field (11:19):
But no, here's my framework for it. I think intuition is like a hypothesis generator and you're constantly generating these hypotheses and others are generating hypotheses as well. And you then take these hypotheses and you put them forward and you debate them and you try to find data to support them or negate them. And then you winnow it down into what is our working hypothesis? And from that you move forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (11:48):
I heard that you read every tweet that mentions Figma and share them with folks. There's a Slack channel where you paste them. I imagine that is a part of this where you're just constantly watching what people are saying about Figma, what people are complaining about.

Dylan Field (12:00):
I definitely look everywhere trying to constantly ingest information about Figma, and it's not just Twitter/X, whatever that's called now, but anywhere on the internet, support channels, et cetera. And I'm always trying to understand. I also ask a lot of questions and I try to get to root problems and understand where people are coming from and what are they actually trying to solve. Sometimes people are saying, "Hey, I need X", but they really want Y or Z. And trying to do that myself and engage and dive deeper there, but also to encourage our team to do that, I think leads to really good outcomes in terms of what we ship.

Lenny Rachitsky (12:51):
Is there something you've changed your mind about, building on that, either based on customer feedback or some employee just making a case and like, "Okay, you're right." Is there something that comes to mind of something you've changed your mind about recently? Somebody said Flides.

Dylan Field (13:09):
For when we started out Flides. I have not. It's Figma Slides. Well, it's not recent, but one good example of me changing my mind is that you all have Pages in Figma, you're welcome. But I think I have deep skepticism of Pages still. I'm not sure they're... If you could freeze time and I could just go in with my team, work on Figma for a very long time, I'm not sure we'd come to the same implementation of Pages that we are at today. I just don't think it's the most elegant solution in the context of the entire system of product design that you could create. The world told me and our team that that did not matter and they needed Pages. And don't worry, we're not shipping Pages. But I am still very skeptical of them and I think that in general, probably my team would tell you that I don't always change my mind, but I also build trust with people in deep ways.

(14:22):
And I think across our organization, if things are not going to be fatal, then if I hear from someone, "Hey, I really think we should do X", then I'll say, "Okay, just go with it. And here's my feedback, here's what I'm skeptical of, let's see what happens." And then sometimes they come back to me and they're like, "See I was right." But usually they're pretty polite about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:49):
Just to build on that, something a lot of people try to work on is being good at influencing leadership execs, CEOs. What do you find works to change your mind? What do people come to you with that helps you like, "Okay, you're actually right?"

Dylan Field (15:05):
I think the more concrete an artifact is or the more you can debate something, the better. I ask for examples a lot, I try to ask follow up questions about things and make sure I fully understand it. And I think where I get stuck sometimes is if I ask follow up questions and we don't have answers yet, and then my response might be, "Let's go find the answer to these questions and then let's go back to this conversation", if I think it's something that's really important. And I think for some people they might go, "Okay, this is actually really obvious. I can't believe you're so dense and you don't get it yet." And sometimes they're right and they come back and they're like, "Okay, here's the data now, can we move on?" And we do, we move on and they're right. And I just think that it's important though to just really understand something from first principles for a lot of decisions. And maybe it's just a perfectionist quality repeated over time, I think it leads to good outcomes as long as you make sure it's not bottle-necking the organization.

Lenny Rachitsky (16:15):
So following up on that, let's talk about product management. So last year you had Brian Chesky here, I think maybe on this stage, maybe a bigger stage. And he said that they got rid of product management at Airbnb and everyone cheered and all the PMs were very sad. And he didn't actually mean they got rid of product management, they changed the function and evolved it. I'm curious just to get your take.

Dylan Field (16:38):
It's funny. This year we have you here Lenny, so that's your answer. No...

Lenny Rachitsky (16:43):
I had him on the-

Dylan Field (16:45):
Before and after, all. Surprise.

Lenny Rachitsky (16:45):
We're still here. We're still here. I want to get your take on product management. You all have amazing product managers at Figma. I've had three of them on the podcast already. I'm curious just what value you find the best product managers bring to Figma?

Dylan Field (17:00):
It was really funny last year after that interview, so Yuhki, our chief product officer, had invited me to a dinner for our PM team. And it took a while to get out of Config at the end of the day, and I eventually made the dinner but I was 40 minutes late. And I walk in and Mihika who was on stage yesterday, presenting Figma Slides, Flides, she was standing up and doing a mock Brian Chesky impersonation. And she's standing up in front of the entire product team and she goes, "And then Brian Chesky's like, 'There don't need to be any PMs.' And Dylan's like... Ooh." And I'm like, "Hi, Mihika." And I'd never seen her so red. And then I gave a quick, "Hey PM team, I believe in you. Thank you for your hard work."

(18:08):
Seriously, I think that if you zoom out, it's always tricky whenever you're asked to formally define, what is the separation between a product manager, a designer, and an engineer? It's always hard to actually create those clear lines. And I think in many organizations they're blurry. But at the end of the day, a PM and designer, they need to have some technical expertise or at least understand how some systems work to probably create the best things they can possibly make. A designer, engineer, they should probably have some sense of the business objectives. They should have some sense of what users want. An engineer and a product manager, they should have taste and craft and some sense of the option space, and some desire to care about the visual implementation.

(19:08):
And I think you can include research in there too, if you want to make it four legs of the stool rather than the trio. And you can talk about all three probably should have exposure to users and be talking in dialogue with users. So I think that if you think about that group holistically, each is important. If you think about a team, there's all these qualities that you have to have to make a great product. And that said, I think for product managers and the product function... I think sometimes when you see people that fall down in that function is because they treat it too much like process. Which is very important too, don't me wrong. Good process can help support good outcomes. But I think that you can't lose sight of the problems that you're solving. You have to go talk to users and you have to actually have a strategy. And if you're really good, you should have a point of view. And some point of views are going to lead to good outcomes and some point of views aren't. And there's some tense sense of taste.

(20:16):
And you also have to bring everyone together and make sure that they get to the objective, that it's celebrated, and that at the end of the project or when you complete a milestone, everyone's stoked. Otherwise, it's not going to be a team that gels, you're not going to get to the next outcome. Even if you get to an outcome and it's a milestone, but if everyone's unhappy, you failed. And so somehow good product people are able to do all this and they're able to create great frameworks that bring everyone along with them. And so everyone's able to have a shared head space around what it is they're trying to get to.

Lenny Rachitsky (20:54):
Someone once said that if PMs disappeared or if a PM goes on vacation, everything's okay for a week or two or three and then things start to crumble a little bit because they glue everything together. Do you find that sort of thing? Let me actually ask a different question along those lines, are you bearish or bullish on the future of product management? Do you think PMs will continue the way they are? Do you think PMs will dwindle any sense of the future of product management?

Dylan Field (21:23):
I think probably everyone's learning to do a bit more of everyone else's job in this current moment. That said, I definitely think there's still immense value in product, immense value in design, immense value in engineering. And so I think those roles will continue to exist.

Lenny Rachitsky (21:43):
So maybe I just want to come back to the question of just, with the best PMs that you work with, do you find, what value do they most bring? I guess is there anything that's like, "Here's what would be gone if we didn't have these PMs"?

Dylan Field (21:57):
The best PMs, I think again, create those frameworks that bring everyone else along and those frameworks also have a point of view and a strategy associated with them. So you're able to take the strategy, take the point of view, wrap it all up in a framework, and then make it so that everyone knows what the destination is and how to get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (22:20):
So along these lines, something I've heard you're really big on is simplification. Somebody told me that when you're in a designer view and things just feel too complex to you, quote, "You furrow your brow and insist there must be something simpler." Why is simplification so top of mind for you, why is it so important for you and just why is it so hard to do?

Dylan Field (22:41):
Oh, gosh. Well, I think probably anyone here who's worked on product knows how hard it is. I think the more that you add, the harder it is to create something that's coherent. One essay that Evan, my co-founder, introduced me to early on in famous history, I think from Stevie's [inaudible 00:23:06] grants or something like that, contains the term irreducible complexity. And it's basically this idea that one plus one does not equal three, it sometimes equals one and a half. And the more that you add and the more that you continue to put in something, the more complex it gets and the worse it gets. And I think this is definitely true for tools.

(23:28):
So in the context of Figma, we can make it more powerful, but to do that in a way that's not making it more complex at the same time is extremely hard. And we have to always be paying attention to how complex or how simple things are because if we don't, it just becomes a monstrosity really fast. And there's parts of our product that, I don't want to dive into that part of the conversation, the self-critique, but definitely as I'm in conversation with a bunch of our product leaders at Figma, there's parts where it's like, "Okay, this thing is too complex as a system and we made all the right local decisions and yet together they're too complex and they're not working anymore. And let's go revisit the system now."

I know you just redesigned Figma. I imagine part of that came from things are just getting too complicated, not as simple as we want. Is there anything that's been bugging you in the old Figma but like, "Oh, this is way too complicated, I really want to simplify this thing"?

Dylan Field (25:09):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:11):
What's that?

Dylan Field (25:12):
We'll move on, but many things.

Lenny Rachitsky (25:18):
Sounds good. And in terms of how to keep things simple, so I had Dharmesh Shah on the podcast, he's the co-founder of HubSpot, and the way he described it is that you're always fighting the second loft through more dynamics of entropy, just the product getting more complicated. And he sees himself as part of the solution, of top down, you have to be on top of that. Is that the way you see it? That's your role, to keep things simple. Do you think people further down the ladder can do that?

Dylan Field (25:46):
Absolutely, everyone's responsible for simplicity. And I think another quote that is not mine but is a really a good one is "Keep the simple things simple. Make the complex things possible." And I think that's a really important principle to hold as you're designing tools. And I'd say that it's really easy to make the simple things complex, unfortunately.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:10):
I want to pivot to talking about early days Figma. So I don't know how many people know this, but it took three and a half years to launch Figma from when you were beginning to work on it.

Dylan Field (26:19):
Way too long, don't do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:22):
This is my question. So it took three and a half years to launch and then five years to get your first customer. Dylan, what the hell were you doing all that time?

Dylan Field (26:28):
I don't think it took five years for a first... Well okay-

Lenny Rachitsky (26:32):
Paying.

Dylan Field (26:33):
First paying customer, sure. Okay, fine. Slightly less but approximately five years, it gets to be round up. I think that if I had been probably better at hiring and recruiting... I see Nadia in the audience, making eye contact with her the entire time, for some reason. She's our chief people officer. If she had been at Figma from day one, we would've hired probably faster and we would've gotten to market faster. But I think that it was a hard product to build and to get everything to come together with. I also see Sho. And I think for... Sho's joined us as a director of engineering. He's a VP of product now. Again, people can wear many hats. And he was someone that joined Figma and said, "Hey, y'all need to ship this thing, you're really close." And he really helped catalyze us to ship in that moment. And I think, in week one, he gave a presentation. It was like, "Here's what we got to do, here's the gap. Everyone agrees on it. Let's go."

Lenny Rachitsky (27:45):
You already said that you wish you shipped earlier. Is there any advice there for just people building something today of-

Dylan Field (27:49):
Get it out as fast as you possibly can. Everything they tell you about making sure that you get a product out really quickly is totally true. The faster you get it out, the more feedback you get. That is a positive thing. And now I index on that when we try to build. And FigJam's a great example of that, we shipped it incredibly fast and it helped us get to market and get feedback faster. Figma Slides, great example of that too. Dev Mode, for what it's worth, it took us longer. We just had to keep iterating and building it and building it again. Certain directions we tried didn't work out and we really had to get to a place where we were able to really believe that we were adding value and really understood the developer's user, and it just didn't happen for a long time. So it's interesting because I think people look at Dev Mode and sometimes they go, "Oh, this is quite simple", to the point about simplicity.

(28:53):
Figma, is this simpler than FigJam? And the reality was it took at least three times as long.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:04):
So your advice is ship quickly. There's also this push the-

Dylan Field (29:09):
I'd hold the bar, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:11):
That's the question I have, is there's also a lot of talk of just the bar has risen. You need, especially B2B software, craft is really important. Linear talks a lot about this, just the bar is very high for people to switch from something out there. Is there anything... I don't think you'll have, "Here's the answer. When you're ready to ship...", but just any advice of just like, "Here's good enough" versus "No, you should probably wait."

Dylan Field (29:32):
Well, another thing that Evan taught me was that for a new launch, you got quality, features, deadline, choose two. And I think that the beautiful thing about software is you can keep iterating on it. So it's not like a physical product where you have to always have quality in there, otherwise it's never going to have quality. You can ship it with features and deadline and then improve it iteratively over time. I'm not saying you should always do that. Sometimes you need to at least have a minimum bar of quality for the things you have and you're going to ship less features maybe.

(30:04):
So you choose quality and deadline and sometimes you say, "Actually here's the minimum feature set and we're going to have this quality bar and you're willing to push it out." But I think you have to know when you're introducing a new thing, what it's going to take and then to make that minimally awesome product. But also I think that when you're iteratively improving it, you shouldn't just be focused on the features, you have to focus on the quality too.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:33):
I like this term you use, 'minimally awesome product'. Love it. So the way you got your early users for Figma is quite fascinating. I don't know how many people know this story, but you basically wrote a script to scrape Twitter and create a graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and then you made it your mission to convince them to use Figma and make them evangelists. Is there anything more to the story there? And then I have a question along those lines.

# How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)

## Transcript

Elizabeth Stone (00:00:00):
We can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence in improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density. And in some ways, it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes. And that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days. And in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior.

Lenny (00:01:06):
Today my guest is Elizabeth Stone. Elizabeth is chief technology officer at Netflix, and as far as I can tell, the first economist to ever be named CTO at a Fortune 500 company. Prior to this role, Elizabeth was vice president of Data and Insights. Before Netflix, she was vice president of science at Lyft, COO at Nuna, a trader at Merrill Lynch, and an economist at Analyst Group. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. We talk about how an economics background has helped Elizabeth in her career and why she expects to see more economists rise in the ranks of tech companies. She shares some of her secret sauce for rising so quickly at so many companies so consistently. We delve into Netflix's very unique culture of high talent density, radical candor, and freedom and responsibility. We also talk about the structure that Netflix has for their data and user research teams, which she believes is a part of Netflix's secret to success. We also get into what biking and triathlons have taught Elizabeth about life and how she brings that into her work and so much more.

(00:04:36):
Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Elizabeth Stone (00:04:41):
Thank you. Thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:04:43):
So when we booked this conversation, you are VP of data in Netflix. And since then you got a promotion, you're now the CTO of Netflix, which feels significantly more fancy. Question for you, what is life like now that you are CTO versus VP of data? How is it most different? I'm imagining more meetings.

Elizabeth Stone (00:05:01):
I would say the biggest thing that changed is probably the amount of context switching and the degree to which I feel behind or I have a lot to learn. And I felt like I had a lot to learn in the VP of data and insights role that I was in before in part because we cover a lot of different areas of the business and there's always people to learn from, but the engineering organization just takes that to 100 basically. So more people to get to know, more problem spaces, aspects of technical expertise that I'm just not as deeply familiar with. And yeah, a lot more meetings.

Lenny (00:05:41):
I imagine many higher stakes meetings as well.

Elizabeth Stone (00:05:44):
Yes. So thankfully not a lot of meetings that Netflix feel like now you're really in this scary room, but it does feel like the role has more consequence, which is actually an exciting thing.

Lenny (00:05:57):
Kind along the lines of what you just talked about being a CTO. Your background is actually unusual. You're a trained economist, you got a PhD in economics. And from what I can tell, you're the first CTO of Fortune 500 company that is an economist trained in economics. First of all, is that true? I don't know if I think that's true, but you tell me.

Elizabeth Stone (00:06:16):
I have not checked the list. That was one of the things I did not do after getting the title. It might be unusual. I've heard a lot of feedback on that, so I don't know if I'm the one and only, but I will definitely say it's probably unusual.

Lenny (00:06:30):
Yeah. So I guess the question is just, do you think this is an anomaly and going to continue to be really rare? Do you think this some are going to see more at tech companies? And generally do you think tech companies should hire more economists?

Elizabeth Stone (00:06:41):
Yes to the last question. That's the easiest of it. But one of the things I observed even with the focus on data science where I've been deeper for a period of time is that economics is a flavor of data science. So it is a set of technical skills for sure. It's a way of framing certain problems or solving challenges.

(00:07:06):
And so when I was first switching from economics into tech, it was before there was a lot of sort of the frenzy around data science that we've seen more recently and it was harder to make that argument that economics is a flavor of data science and maybe complimentary to other versions of data science. And I feel more strongly about that now that I've seen it up close. And so maybe by extension I would say just like I think data science can be helpful for a lot of different problems that you might not immediately think, "Oh, this is something that we should bring data to," I think that economics is generally valuable for a lot of different challenges and it's a useful perspective to add to things, especially in a business context and especially in how we want to simplify problems in a way that makes them feel tractable.

(00:08:00):
So I feel like that's been a benefit to me to have had that type of formal training and then bring that perspective or way of thinking to different roles. And so I don't know that many people at Netflix think of me as an economist, but I find it comes out in the way I think about things. So to the extent that that's true generally, I think it's useful in a lot of companies. And I feel like even since I made the switch towards tech, I've seen it become much, much more common to think about the value of having economists on teams.

Lenny (00:08:32):
Just to pull on that thread a little bit more, is there something very tactical or concrete that you can share that you find helpful with that background that you found helpful in your career?

Elizabeth Stone (00:08:42):
Other than the dismal dry science of it all? So one example would probably be in an understanding incentives and thinking about unintended consequences. I think that that is true both in terms of internal leadership, so being part of a management team that's thinking about how do we clarify priorities or motivate a company or define the problems we want to solve. And then part of it is more externally oriented. How do we want to think about what Netflix is to consumers and how we want to think about competition?

(00:09:24):
There can be a rational way of thought, which is one version of economics of shouldn't rational intelligent people behave in the following way. And then there's the, well, if given certain incentives, what might you see that we didn't think was optimal or we weren't expecting to happen but could be a consequence or repercussion here? And so I think that that type of framing, I don't know if it's unique to economics in a way because it has elements of psychology to it as well and planning ahead has become really useful for thinking through cause and effect. So that has come up in a lot of different spaces in Netflix and in other roles I've been in.

Lenny (00:10:08):
I was looking at your LinkedIn and looking at your career over the years. It seems like you've had a meteoric rise at four different companies. And I'll just walk through them briefly. So at your first job, you went from associate to vice president in three years. At the next company, Nuna, you went from manager of data science to COO in two years. At Netflix you went from VP to CTO in three years. I think that's really rare. I'm curious what is your secret sauce to being so successful at so many places and especially in the context of what advice can you share with folks earlier in their career?

Elizabeth Stone (00:10:46):
This is one of those questions that sparks the reflection that I wouldn't normally do, so that's great. I really don't think of it as a secret sauce, but maybe I can walk through some of the things that I think have been instrumental. As you listed that out, it sounds like the two to three year point is the real sweet spot, so maybe there's something about that timeline. But I think some things almost feel trite in how I would say them, which is I'm very dedicated to the work and to the teams I'm part of. It's been part who I am for a long time that I give everything I've got to the job that I'm in. And I think that dedication and that I get joy out of that has mattered. It matters because I enjoy what I'm doing. I do the best work I possibly can, less so for myself and my own ambition and more so because I think of myself as being part of a team and so I really need to deliver for that team.

(00:11:52):
I think that framing in my mind and that motivation has helped me in a few fronts, which is the way in which I build partnerships with people I work with that I really care about setting other people up for success and being someone that people want to work with, so I learn from them, they learn from me, and we get better outcomes for the business together, I have found that part of that is being someone that people can leverage to translate from technical to non-technical and non-technical to technical. So that I do think has been a relative advantage in my role. So while I was often sitting in more technically-oriented teams, a lot of the advancement in my career was to roles that required that type of communication fluency. It grew out of being able to partner with people across the businesses who didn't necessarily have the same background, but where we needed to really connect spaces so that we could be more effective.

(00:12:57):
That was something that I think really the training for that came from analysis group where it was a very quantitative set of work that we had to find a way to communicate to judges and juries for economic cases. So that was something that was trained in other roles and I think I've been able to leverage. I'm a relatively introverted only child, so I observe a lot, which means that I learned from other people. And in each of these roles I have tried really hard to watch what other people are doing, think about how could I learn something from them, whether it's the thing that I want to be able to do myself or it's the thing that I think, "Oh, that doesn't quite fit or feel authentic with my style." And I do a lot of that introspection. So I have been surrounded by amazing people in all these roles and I have a feeling that I learned a lot by osmosis and observation and then have been able to leverage that to be stronger in the roles I was sitting in.

Lenny (00:14:00):
I took a few notes here. A few things you mentioned is just like, dedication, essentially working really hard and taking your work seriously, being part of a team and setting other people up for success, translating complex tech language and problems to non-tech people, and then being really good at observing and learning from other people around you. Is there an example or two that you could share of some of these to make it even more concrete for people? Like dedication. Is that just like working many hours, being part of a team? Anything along those lines to share a story maybe to help people put this into practice.

Elizabeth Stone (00:14:35):
No, and it's a good clarification because the dedication piece really isn't about long working hours. It's more about how much I care about excellence, I guess. So giving it my best in those situations. And that might not mean that I work really wild hours or I work weekends or I'm the one who's willing to sacrifice the vacation. I've actually tried to avoid setting that as an expectation, but more that I hold myself to a very high standard.

(00:15:13):
So an example would be, especially as I've gotten more senior in roles, there can be an expectation that it's okay for other people to wait on me. So whether it's the timing for a meeting or providing input on something or reviewing a document or following through on something I said that I was going to do, and I really try to avoid that, which means that if someone sends me something, I try to be very responsive about it. If I know that I said I'm going to do something, I follow through on it in the timeline that I said I was going to do. If I have a meeting, I try to be on time to that meeting.

(00:16:01):
Those are all flavors of dedication to the work that show up in, "Oh, it seems like Elizabeth works really hard," but the motivation factor is other people are relying on me and I want to show up for them. And so that's when I say dedication and it's related to the second point around showing up well for the team, those would all be examples of I feel urgency in responding to people and doing high quality work.

(00:16:27):
For the other parts of technical to non-technical, I think a great example is actually a very timely one at Netflix, which is, we are making strides to offer live content types. So live events, live TV shows. We announced this week that we're going to be hosting WWE starting later this year and early next year, 2025. That is easier said than done. I know that there's a lot of entertainment companies that have live content. But Netflix has really been in the streaming content business, so live content is something new for us and it's something that's going to require a really close partnership between our content organization and our products and technology organization because there's a content strategy to it, there's a business strategy, there's a technology strategy to it. A big part of my role is, can I explain how we're going to approach those technical problems in a way that builds competence with the content team? Can I try to understand their content strategy in a way that sets the technical teams up for success and we understand what we need to be able to deliver on here in terms of requirements.

(00:17:46):
I don't think I'd be able to do my current role well if I wasn't able to do that type of translation for something that's going to be a big bet for the business and something we want to invest in jointly. And then to set my partners up for success in that. So I am going to do everything I can to make sure we deliver well for my content partners because I feel like that's what's best for Netflix in the business.

Lenny (00:18:09):
Amazing examples. In terms of life content, I think about the Love is Blind. I think it was for premier, whatever, reunion that we got sucked into that show. So good job. And I think there were some issues with that, right? That reunion streak.

Elizabeth Stone (00:18:24):
Well, yeah, that was about a little less than a year ago now. So the amazing thing about failure is you learn a lot. We learned a lot. We've taken notes on it and we had a couple successful events after that, including the Netflix Cup last October. And we've got some exciting events coming up. So I think that's something that strengthened us, but did reveal that we're tackling a hard problem.

Lenny (00:18:50):
Yeah, the Twitter feeds during that, Love is Blind premiere were hilarious. People are pissed.

(00:18:57):
Okay. And then in terms of the, keeping a high bar for yourself, I love that. I think about a quote that... There's a VC, Ann Miura-Ko, at Floodgate and she did this interview with Tim Ferris. She shared that her dad always asked her, "Are you doing a World-class job with this? Are you doing a world-class job with your homework? Are you doing a world-class job with your piano recital?" And that's the bar that he always had for her. And I feel like that's a really good way to think about work and life in general if you can.

Elizabeth Stone (00:19:28):
Yeah, my mother used to describe to me, probably still does, though it required more repeating when I was younger, that the last 5% is the 5% that really mattered. And so it is that framing of the extra effort you put into something to make it world-class or to make it excellent. And so I do like to push myself that way and I hope it sets a good example for other people too. It's very consistent with especially the company cultures that I tend to thrive in where that's the general expectation of the culture. So you don't feel like you're doing it alone, because then I think you can start to feel frustrated by that.

Lenny (00:20:15):
I know that this is a big part of Netflix culture and I want to get into it. But before that, I'm curious just what that looks like with people that report to you. How do you help them level up in this skill of having a really high bar? And an example I'll give as you think about maybe an example is the way I described this to my PMs was, you want to have this aura that you've got this that, "If you give Lenny something, he's got this. He's going to follow up, he's going to close the loop, he's going to get it done. If he can't get it done, he'll tell me, I feel like this thread will not disappear. He won't drop this ball." Is there anything that you've learned as a good way to help someone learn this kind of skill, understand why this is so important?

Elizabeth Stone (00:20:53):
It shows up for the people who report to me, is one part example setting. So if I don't do it, why would they do it? I treat that very seriously that we should all be held to the same standards.

(00:21:12):
And as a second thing, I give feedback when it's not up to the standard. So I think one of the things I've observed especially with people on my teams is that the expectations aren't always clear and you can't assume that they're clear if you don't share them. When something's not meeting expectations or really showing up as excellence, I think it's a combination of both giving the feedback on that and being direct about it and being specific about what would it take to get this to the bar that I am expecting or to show up in the way that I'm expecting.

(00:21:55):
And then the third and probably most important thing is help them fill that gap. So that would mean... Let's take an example. It certainly has happened frequently in many jobs. A document is okay, it's not great, it's not going to be easy for people to follow, it's not as crisp as it could be. There's things that would strengthen it. I can both give the feedback on that to make sure like, yes, it's going to take another round of iteration, yes, we're going to have to work another week on this and not be done with it, but pushing people to get there, and then jumping into the document and helping.

(00:22:32):
So I feel very strongly about, and that's kind of what I mean by setting an example of like, "Let's work on this together," and then through that, help people uplevel themselves so the next time around they know the expectations and they've had help getting there in the past. So that's probably happened a thousand times in my career where I jump in with both feet because something needs to be better and I think the teams are better for it afterwards, or I hope they are.

Lenny (00:23:00):
I think that's such a good framework just to kind of mirror back what you said, "Set expectations that the bar is going to be really high and here's what I'm expecting from you." Give them very specific feedback on where the gap is and then help them fill that gap. I think a lot of people may feel this and hear this and they're like, "Oh man, I don't want a manager that's like this high of an expectation person and it just feels really stressful." But I've had these managers and I feel like that's when I've learned the most and leveled up the most, is having someone that had really high expectations and then helped me understand, "Here's where you're not doing as well as you can. I know you can do better. Go back and work on this." I know that sounds annoying, but I think in practice it ends up helping you most in your career. I imagine you've seen a similar result.

Elizabeth Stone (00:23:45):
I think so. I mean you'd have to ask some of the people on my team. So I might look at it differently that they look at it.

Lenny (00:23:51):
[inaudible 00:23:52] differences.

Elizabeth Stone (00:23:53):
It's a hard skill because it's not always easy to give feedback, especially if you feel like you know someone's put a lot of effort into something. And so I give a lot of thought to how I deliver that feedback so it feels like we're on the same team and I'm trying to help them be successful, not to help encourage failure. And that's where I think that third piece of the framework of jumping in to help can make people feel like, "I'm in a safe space. My manager wants me to be successful. My manager's helping me here." I do often do that behind the scenes. So maybe that's another flavor of this, which is, I don't do it live in the big meeting in front of all the people where the presentation doesn't go very well. I do it afterwards where it feels like a safer space to say, "Here's a way this could have gone better. Let's think about this differently next time." So it gives people a little grace and a little bit of an ability to absorb that feedback without feeling like it's kind of on a stage.

Lenny (00:25:02):
Another thing someone may be feeling when they're hearing this is like, "Oh my god, it's going to take me so many hours to just get it to a place Elizabeth is happy with." And I know you said that this doesn't mean necessarily many hours. Do you have any advice or thoughts on just how to avoid burnout and working all the time, but also keeping this really high bar and high expectations?

Elizabeth Stone (00:25:21):
It truly is not about time. I even found myself in a meeting earlier today saying, "If we're clear on the objectives of something, it might be that the last 20% of polish on the document is a really bad use of time. So if we're going to come together to talk through..." Like quarterly business review was the example, what were the highlights? What were the low lights? What were the learnings from the quarter? Where are there places of misalignment? The reason we're doing the quarterly business review is to have a really candid conversation about how we think things are going, to have a debate about things where maybe we're stuck. It's not to have a perfectly polished document for that conversation.

(00:26:08):
So my feedback in that instance would be, I would much rather have someone spend the time thinking about what's the conversation we really want to have? "How do I tee that up?" Not, "Could I spend another 20 hours to make it look like everything's perfect in this document?" And so I think in that sense it's not just excellence, like you wrote the perfect document, I should probably be careful to not use that as the only example, but instead we really got to the outcome we wanted to get to because we were thoughtful about it and we put a lot of energy and time and iteration into making sure we got to that outcome.

Lenny (00:26:43):
And is this an example where you gave someone feedback that they spent too much time on the polish or is this earlier? And to give the pyramid of this framework you kind of shared of set expectations, give specific feedback, help them fill the gap and then do it in private, is this the expectation setting in this example or is this feedback you spend too much time on this?

Elizabeth Stone (00:27:01):
This is expectation setting. So one of the things in my new role is that there's some practices that the team has had where they're trying to understand, Are we still going to have those practices? What's going to be the same versus different about those things?" and get an understanding of my expectations. So it's great that people ask that question so that I can be clear about, "Oh wait, if you're on the last 20% of this polishing the dock, I'd rather spend time over here. And here's how I would like the conversation to go so we all get something out of it instead of it feeling like it's just a leadership reviewer on my behalf." So in this specific situation, it was setting expectations ahead of time so that we can set everyone up for success.

Lenny (00:27:44):
Awesome. Okay. So we've kind of been talking around this, but this is an important part of the Netflix culture. Just broadly, Netflix has a really special and unique culture. Even though it's been around for I think over 25 years now, it feels like the culture has come up many times. There's that initial culture deck that came out that blew everyone's minds. There's a recent book, No Rules Rules I think it's called. And it feels like Netflix has done a great job at maintaining its culture.

(00:28:10):
It feels to me there's these three important elements, and maybe there's more. One is very high talent density and a focus on high performers. Two is candor and being really direct. And then three is giving people freedom and responsibility and getting rid of useless processes like vacation time and things like that. So maybe just to dive into that first one of high talent density and this focus on high performance. I guess the question there is just like, what does this look like in Netflix? And I imagine part of it is hiring, part of it is performance reviews. And then just why is it so important? Why is this such a focus on Netflix? What happens when you have such a high talent density?

Elizabeth Stone (00:28:51):
It's just so intrinsic to who Netflix is as a company. And in some ways it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes and that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days.

(00:29:37):
A big piece of that talent density is definitely hiring. So who are the people coming in and joining the team? But a lot of it is, we can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence and improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density.

(00:30:03):
And so in some ways it's not the end, it's the means to the end in what Reed and the rest of the leadership team has been trying to build. And so in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior. What I mean by that is giving the feedback, this gets into the second bucket. So giving feedback, being candid around your expectations when they're not being met, what could be better in helping people improve, and be able to receive that type of feedback yourself in order to keep talent density high? Because no one comes to Netflix as a perfect human being and stays a perfect human being the whole time. We all have ways that we could grow and improve. And so in order to keep that bar high, you have to be willing to have those types of very uncomfortable conversations. It's an uncomfortable amount of candor and feedback in order to keep that bar high.

(00:31:10):
And then the other piece of it is another thing that doesn't come naturally to humans, which is making a call in pretty timely fashion if someone's not able to meet the bar, and to say either, "I don't think the role you're sitting in is the right role, or I don't think that Netflix is the right place for you," and to make that something that is part of best practice to get to a point where you could make that decision. And that's where we refer to the keepers test, which is really just a mental framing to make sure we hold ourselves accountable for this. Where if I'm asking myself the question, "If this person on my team came to me and said, 'I'm leaving today. I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it,' would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?" If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, "Should you really be here? Are you in the right role?", if I might be a little bit relieved if you said you were leaving.

(00:32:20):
The reason the keeper test and that question is useful is because no one wants to think that way. It's very hard to say to someone, "I think this isn't the right fit. I think you should move on from the company." So we have to introduce some of those reflections in order to encourage the behavior. And we also then want to get to a place where when you're having that tough conversation, people aren't surprised by it. That is easier said than done. But you can only get to that conversation around, "I don't think Netflix and you are the right fit for one another" if you've been giving feedback along the way. And so it feels like in its most ideal state, it's a mutual observation. In practice, it's not always that smooth. Obviously we are humans. But that all feeds on itself in order to make sure that we're really holding ourselves to what we say our behavioral norms as part of the culture.

Lenny (00:33:17):
How is that operationalized? Is that just mental model that you should have in mind? Or is it like every quarter you should go through this exercise? Is it part of the performance review process? How does that actually operationalize at Netflix?

Elizabeth Stone (00:33:29):
It's definitely a mental model. So when we talk to managers about what does it mean to be a manager at Netflix, it would mean you should be with some frequency asking yourself this about the people on your team. People ask me frequently, "Am I passing your keeper test?" So it becomes part of a regular manager direct report, one on one. And it is just another way of saying, "Am I meeting your expectations? What's going well? What's not going well? How are you thinking about things?" And that can sometimes be a very awkward conversation to have. So in the middle of a lot of like, "We have to talk about this project or that deliverable or this thing that's happening," to take the time to step back and just say, "How am I doing?", can feel loaded sometimes. And the keeper test, while it feels like a very heavy concept, creates a lightness around being able to have that conversation regularly. So we do operationalize it. A point that you made, I'll just clarify, we don't have performance reviews.

Lenny (00:34:33):
Oh, wow.

Elizabeth Stone (00:34:34):
So we don't have a practice that a lot of other companies do where we would think about reflecting on a rating of how things are going. We do have an annual cycle of 360 feedback where you request and receive feedback from a lot of people, but it's not an input to some output, it's just for the value of the feedback and to make sure we're keeping that muscle. And we have an annual compensation cycle where we reflect on how are people doing? And so you think about performance as part of both promotions and as part of compensation, but in that way it has to be part of the day-to-day and part of the operating rhythm because we don't create a process where that would come to the surface.

Lenny (00:35:20):
Interesting. I didn't know that. So the idea there is just ongoing, like the whole... So what many people dream of, no performance reviews, we'll give you ongoing real-time feedback. We don't have to wait six months. I feel like people talk about this but rarely do this, but that's how you guys operate.

Elizabeth Stone (00:35:36):
In ideal.

Lenny (00:35:37):
In ideal, yeah.

Elizabeth Stone (00:35:38):
In practice. It's like you have to keep reminding yourself, "This is our ideal" because it's really easy to rely on the annual 360 cycle. And all of a sudden I do get about 300 pieces of feedback. And some of those things are on things that happened six months ago and I think, "Oh, I wish you had told me this at the time, that would've been more living the Netflix culture." So we have to push ourselves to do it that way. But yeah, that is if working well, it's very timely direct feedback. The 360 site goal is sort of the annual check-in on, "Let me get the full picture. Let me be able to distill some themes. Let me tee it up for a conversation with my manager." And then it does remove the sort of crutch of an every six month performance review or something like that.

Lenny (00:36:31):
When you talked about this example of someone asking you often, "Am I meeting your keeper test?", it makes me feel like someone's just super nervous. They're like, "Am I passing your keeper test?" And it makes me feel like it could create a culture of just like a lot of stress and worry and this hunger games mentality of like, "I got to compete and worry and I might die or get fired any day." I'm guessing the solution to that is partly cultural. This is just the way we work. You don't need to stress all the time, but you may be let go if you're not meeting this keeper test. How do you avoid this just constant worry that you might be fired any day and that you may not be hitting the bar?

Elizabeth Stone (00:37:08):
In my personal experience, I have felt a lot more at ease by having these conversations than by not having them. So in many roles I've had, I haven't been sure how I was doing or things I could be doing better on, and I didn't quite know how to get that information. And that made me feel much more stressed or nervous or at risk than having it be part of the culture to have those conversations.

(00:37:45):
So the thing that I think can be nerve wracking, and I feel it myself, is the high bar for excellence at Netflix and if we're doing this while you're surrounded by amazing people. And that can feed a sense of, "Am I doing well enough compared to how everyone else is doing? I know the bar's high." For the most part, that can drive people and in a good way, but in some ways it makes people nervous. And that's where I think it's helpful to know we expect to have these conversations so you can just kind of let your shoulders relax a little bit of, "Yes, the expectations are high, but my manager says I'm doing a great job, or my manager says I'm not doing a great job, but they gave me concrete things that I could do better." And so I think knowing is better than not. And so in that sense, it's the culture combined with the conversations around performance I hope take a little bit of that stress out of it. But I've certainly heard it a lot that without that conversation, people can be nervous.

Lenny (00:38:49):
That's such a good point and such a good example that I feel like every company wants to have a high bar and have only high performers and keep the bar really high for every person they hire. I'm curious, I know this could be its own podcast and book, but just in terms of hiring people that are amazing and keeping this bar of excellence, is there anything you can point out that might be helpful to other companies hiring to help identify amazing people and make sure that bar stays high? One thing I know is you guys pay a top market for salary. I think that's one unique thing about Netflix, is we just pay people. So maybe that's an part of this answer, but just what advice do you have for people to keep a really high bar in their talent?

Elizabeth Stone (00:39:33):
Yeah, I mean on the compensation point, we pay what we call personal top of market, meaning we want to be highly competitive in the pay, but we don't want pay to be like the golden handcuffs of Netflix sets market rather than paying people a strongly competitive compensation. So I think that that's important for attracting and retaining talent and has been a big part of the culture, but almost more importantly, we hope we don't have to rely on that to want people to want to be at Netflix or for us to be able to assess whether people are going to thrive at Netflix.

(00:40:20):
The way that I've thought about hiring with that context is we know we're going to offer you very highly competitive compensation, but are you going to come to Netflix and help us identify the right problems to solve or new ways to solve existing problems? And that's a different way of hiring than you might think about, especially at scale where you're saying, "Does this person have this skill, this skill, this skill? Check they're going to fit in this box and they're going to deliver this work that I need them to do." I'm being intentionally simplistic. I recognize a lot of people don't hire actually that way. But at Netflix we try really hard to say we're looking for the new perspective or the person who's actually going to make us stronger as a team. So thinking about additive skills, additive perspectives, people who are going to push our thinking on something. That tends to help us with thinking about talent density because you're constantly introducing people to the team who uplevel.

(00:41:25):
So then the questions you have to ask in an interview might be different because yes, we're trying to assess do you have the baseline skills to be successful here, but we're also looking for the things that make people exceptional or even stronger than the team we've got. And then you think about making the magical teams comprised of all those amazing minds and what can you get out of that. And that feels like more that the talent density and practice.

Lenny (00:41:50):
Got it. So the advice there essentially is, don't look for someone just simply great. Look for someone that raises the bar for the whole team, brings in a whole new perspective.

Elizabeth Stone (00:41:58):
Yes. That's a great way to say it. Yeah, it's a good way to say it.

Lenny (00:42:00):
I think what's great about this idea of just maintaining excellence consistently is that the best people want to work with the best people. And as soon as there's one person that sucks and the company allows for that, it just brings everyone down because they know, "Hey, we can be okay. We'll stick or no one's going to do anything about it." And when you make it clear, we only want the best and only hire the best and only keep the best, it keeps the best there, right? I imagine that's part of the strategy.

Elizabeth Stone (00:42:29):
Yeah. It's definitely the goal. And I think understanding that having gaps in the team and people's skillsets or their behavior can be really toxic for other people on the team. So it's a cost.

(00:43:54):
So I asked on Twitter what questions to ask you. And there's a great question that came in from Nan Yu. He's the head of product for Linear and he asks, "What practices does Netflix do that other companies should not attempt to do because their talent level is so much higher than other companies?"

Elizabeth Stone (00:44:15):
That is freedom and responsibility in a nutshell. So let me explain that. It's a good question. It's kind of related to what I was saying earlier, that talent density is a prerequisite for a lot of the other ways we operate. So if we want to create a work environment where we are not prescriptive about how people solve problems or the scope of problems that they could tackle, assuming they're highly impactful for the business, and we don't have a lot of process around that work, so think about being able to make large innovations to our engineering systems or introducing new ways to think about metrics and experimentation, we get a lot of those things because we give people the freedom and the space to explore and question things and experiment in a way with solutions. I think that that would be very hard if not dangerous if we didn't have a high talent density.

(00:45:32):
It's really not a top down do A, then B, then C. Even in how we go through some of our planning processes or thinking about how we think about priorities, there is a lot of room for contribution across all levels of the team and that requires talent density. And then there's things like you have to have amazing people if you're not going to have really strict guardrails that would influence the consumer experience or business stakeholders experience. We do give people a lot of responsibility on those things. So I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness is all hinging on we've got amazing people who are smart, but even better have strong judgment.

Lenny (00:46:18):
This is kind of what you always hear from people giving founders advice is, "Just hire amazing people, get out of their way and let them do their job," which is often not a successful experience. What are examples that either things that came out of this freedom, I don't know, products or features or ideas that came out of this or policies or processes you don't have that everyone else might have? So I know there's no vacation time, there's unlimited vacation time, I assume. Is that still a thing? Unlimited vacation time?

Elizabeth Stone (00:46:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:46:49):
Okay, cool. All right, great. And I know performance reviews, you talked about that. So I guess in either direction, is there an example of something that came out of this freedom or some process that which surprised people that you don't have or a framework or system?

Elizabeth Stone (00:47:05):
We've been able to deliver... I'll speak to my own team around innovations in our content delivery network or innovations in encoding or innovations in discovery and personalization. We're not driven by some leader saying, "I think this is a priority." They were driven in many cases by individual contributors who had great ideas for innovation. So a lot of the stuff that Netflix has succeeded in, came from creating space for people on the team. So there's probably thousands of examples of product features and things like that that came out of creating this space. And right now, the trick is finding the sweet spot so that we can operate efficiently at this type of scale without snuffing out some of that, what was kind of the core beauty of the culture.

Lenny (00:47:55):
Maybe a last question around just the culture. We talked about candor a bit. I'm just curious if there's an example that comes to mind of an example of candor that you recently saw or had to be the candid person that might be interesting to share where it's like, "Oh wow, that's what you mean when you say a culture of candor."

Elizabeth Stone (00:48:15):
There's a couple things that come to mind. I am generally a transparent leader, meaning I share information freely and openly. It's part of the culture to context, not control, which means part of my job is to make sure that people have the context they need to do their jobs well. And in practice, that means I take notes in leadership meetings and I share those notes with the whole organization. And that is sometimes it includes candor around reflections on things that aren't going well or problems we need to solve. Sometimes it's just letting people know, "Here's what leadership's talking about so that they have a sense of what's top of mind." But it's a version of transparency that I feel strongly about, doesn't exist a lot of other places. I think it's a version of candor too in being able to share... I can't always share every detail of everything that we're talking about, but I do try to share things that probably push the boundary a little bit in the team, feeling like they understand what's happening across the company and what I'm thinking about.

(00:49:22):
And then there's a second example that comes to mind, which is, until two years ago, individual contributors didn't have levels at Netflix. So all engineers were just senior engineers, all data scientists were senior data scientists, and we did not have a leveling system. We introduced IC levels two years ago almost exactly. And it was a big, big, big shift because it was seen as something that was sort of sacred of it. A lot of people came to Netflix because we didn't have it. We didn't have process around promotions. This is probably part of why we never had performance reviews, because promotions really weren't at play. And it gave people a sense of freedom of not having to worry about that type of structure. But when you get to a scale of an organization, we needed some type of scaffolding to say, "We want to talk about how we compose teams. When do we need the person who has 30 years of experience? When do we want to have a new grad?" Because that's what the work requires. We didn't have a language for it.

(00:50:27):
So I introduced Levels a couple of years ago and we had quite a change rollercoaster is the only way I can describe how it went.

Lenny (00:50:38):
That's a good phrase.

Elizabeth Stone (00:50:40):
Yeah, it was sort of like being the tumble dry machine for a few months, and so really talking through it with the team. That's just context and backdrop. For an example of candor recently, which is, we had kind of a postmortem or a retro on how has it gone with IC levels. So it's kind of like wells, not wells. And I would normally think in a lot of cultures it would be like, "Well, we got past that change. We're living that change." Don't reflect on it. Because that kind of opened some of that early debate. And I felt differently about it. I think it's a good example of being candid about, this was a big change for us. It hasn't all gone perfectly. There's a lot that we can do better in how we implement levels at Netflix. And I would rather share that information than pretend it's all gone swimmingly and we achieved every objective. So I think that I try to build examples like that because I do think that level of candor and reflection helps build the sense of community and trust across the team.

Lenny (00:51:44):
That's an awesome example. Kind of along the lines of that, but also this category of freedom and responsibility, something Netflix innovated long ago, and I'm curious if this is still a thing, is this idea of Chaos Monkeys, which essentially are a program that runs on your infrastructure that just kills random processes and things and just to see what breaks and make sure things are stable when things actually start falling apart. Is Chaos Monkeys... Was that what it's called? And then is that still a thing? Is there still some Chaos Monkeys running around the servers?

Elizabeth Stone (00:52:19):
Not unbridled Chaos Monkeys. No.

Lenny (00:52:22):
Okay. Contains chaos and niche.

Elizabeth Stone (00:52:24):
Bur no, we carry too much responsibility, speaking of freedom and responsibility for the member experience to inject pain, though we do do a lot of experiments to test resilience, and that does probably mean injecting things that we're not quite sure whether A is better than B. And so that happens across engineering systems really at scale. But it is not for pure chaos, it's for intentional learning and so we can avoid making bigger mistakes. And then as we go into new efforts like cloud games, we have a beta that's out now, Live would be another example. We do try to come up with intentionally low profile examples where we can test the bounds of our systems in a way that's unlikely to damage the member experience. But that's less randomness, more by design. And so we're doing that in a few places that feels mostly good engineering practice so we can understand when it's really showtime and we're going to really test our systems, will they be able to perform like we want them to.

Lenny (00:53:42):
RIP Chaos Monkey.

Elizabeth Stone (00:53:45):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:53:47):
So kind of along these lines of data, so data itself has always been at the heart of Netflix. My understanding is the way the data team and the insights team is structured has been one of the reasons Netflix has been so successful. And that's the team you led before you moved into this new role. Can you just talk about how these teams are structured and why this structure is so effective?

Elizabeth Stone (00:54:14):
Yeah. I certainly like to think of it as being special. It's unusual. I can explain why. So the scale of company that Netflix now is very often data oriented teams are embedded in other parts of the business. So it could either be they're embedded in a business line like ads or games, or they are organized more functionally separating data engineers from data scientists, from analytics engineers, from consumer researchers. We've resisted that and kept a centralized team that is both functionally diverse. So across all those types of functions that I just described and works on nearly every area of the business from within the team. I sort of understand why a lot of companies move away from this because it really does require basically extraordinary partnership that we would have people working on data problems that don't report into the teams that are relying on them.

(00:55:30):
But the benefit we get is we get to think about our functional expertise. So are we really world's best data engineers, world's best data scientists? And how do we continue to be ever better from a functional and technical perspective? It gives people better career paths because there's more mobility across the teams. It feels like a team that has a functional expertise with a lot of different problems to solve. And so I think it enables more cross-pollination of ideas in a way.

# The paths to power: How to grow your influence and advance your career | Jeffrey Pfeffer (Stanford)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're going to be talking about how to grow your power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:02):
The reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being less stressed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
You're not describing how the world should work. This is just how it is.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:15):
Not only is, but how it was and how it will be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
The Seven Rules of Power, get out of your own way, break the rules, show up in a powerful fashion, create a powerful brand, network relentlessly, use your power, and understand that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:32):
This is not about personality. These are skills they can be mastered.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
People might be hearing this and they're like, "I don't want to be this person."

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:38):
Well, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one. That is one way to get in our own way. If I think power is dirty, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
The opening quote to your book that I have here, if you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:58):
That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey is a Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford's graduate School of Business, and teaches one of the two most popular and oversubscribed courses in all of the MBA program, called the Paths to Power. The other class, by the way, is Touchy-Feely, which we dove into last month. In his class and in his recent book, the Seven Rules of Power, Jeffrey teaches the things that you can do in your life and in your work to build your power, and through that get things done and advance in your career. As one student described the class, it's the cod liver oil of the Graduate School of Business. You know it's good for you, but you feel a little nervous about it. In our conversation, we dig into each of the seven powers, why it's important to build these skills even if you feel uncomfortable.

(00:01:48):
We talk through a bunch of examples of the power in action and the impact it has had on people's lives, why it isn't as cringey or scary as you may think. I was actually nervous to have this conversation and I ended up being a huge fan of Jeffrey and the work that he does. We end the conversation with what you can start doing today to start building your own power. This podcast is basically for anyone that wants to advance in their career, whether you're an IC or a CEO, and I'm really excited to bring it to you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:02:36):
Thank you, Lenny. I am honored that you invited me on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
I'm even more honored that you decided to come on. We're going to be talking about something that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. I think it's going to make me uncomfortable. We're going to be talking about how to grow your power in life and in business. Let me just start by asking why does this stuff make people uncomfortable, and why is it still important for people to learn how to do this well?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:02):
Well, it's important because a guy named Gerald Ferris developed a scale of political skill. And he and a bunch of his colleagues over the years did a lot of empirical research that demonstrates that political skill is associated with a lot of positive outcomes, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being happy in your job, being less stressed. So the reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things. The reason why it makes people uncomfortable. You said it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should ask you the question, why does it make you uncomfortable?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:44):
There's a lot of things here that are probably not how people want to live their life necessarily, or want other people to act.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:51):
Yeah, so I think it makes people uncomfortable because the realities of what it takes to get power bear almost no resemblance to what you're taught in Sunday school or the mosque or wherever, how your parents raised you. They bear almost no resemblance to how we think the world ought to be. They bear a little resemblance to our aspirations. And I think we look around the world and we see people who have acquired enormous amounts of power and have used it for bad. But I tell people, I see people with hammers hitting other people on the head. That does not mean that a hammer is not a useful tool. You can take a screwdriver and stab it into somebody's belly. I have a very dear friend who we'll probably talk about later in the podcast. Laura Esserman is a breast cancer surgeon, and I tell people, Laura has a knife. She uses it to cure cancer. Muggers have knives. They use it to rob people. So I think we've confused the tool for how it has been used.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:56):
You also have this quote that the people who need to understand power and build their power skills are people who come from backgrounds or characteristics who would normally put them at a disadvantage.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:05:04):
I think that's exactly right. I will go this Sunday to Nashville Tennessee to talk to a bunch of people of color in the NFL who are trying to rise up the ranks. Stanford runs a program because the NFL is serious, I think, about trying to make more opportunity for people, underrepresented minorities. But these are folks who will not succeed unless they learn power skills, because the world is stacked against them in lots of ways.

(00:07:51):
Another element of your course that you try to make clear in your syllabus is to teach people not to be as judgmental. You also have this whole huge bold phrase, "This class is not for everyone." Can you just talk a bit about maybe why it's not for everyone and then why being less judgmental is important?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:08:07):
The class is extremely popular. I have a long waiting list. It's kind of mythical. And because of the principle of social influence, we are influenced by what other people do. We're influenced in our choices of restaurants, we're influenced in our choices of music. I'm not sure I like Taylor Swift, but I certainly want to go see Taylor Swift because everybody else is. And many people sign up for the class. And one year in particular, there were some people who sat in about the third row up, directly in front of me, and they looked every day like they were having some terrible thing put up some horrible orifice or something. They looked literally in pain, and so I decided, and of course they learned nothing. If you come to the class and you're in that much psychological discomfort, you're not going to learn anything.

(00:08:55):
And so what I try to do is tell people that in order to benefit from this class, you have to be open to learning the material. And if you're not, and by the way, this would be true for any class. If you go to physics and you say, I don't like physics, I hate physics, I don't believe in physics, I don't believe in the theory of physics, whatever, you're not going to learn anything. And so I'm trying to get the class, given those huge waiting lists, I'm trying to get the class to have people in it who are in fact going to benefit from it rather than sit there and look like they're in pain. And the judgmental thing, if Matthew 7, "Judge not that ye be not judged." The Koran says, "Only Allah can judge people." The American poet, Walt Whitman said, "Be curious, not judgmental."

(00:09:46):
Mother Teresa said, "If you judge people, you have no time to love them." Judgment, if I need to build a positive relationship with Lenny because you are on my critical path in my job, and jobs necessarily entail a reasonable amount of interdependence, I get things done through and with other people. If I decide that Lenny is whatever set of bad adjectives you want to use, dumb, incompetent, immoral, whatever, my ability to build a positive relationship with you, and you remain on my critical path, becomes almost zero unless you're a better actor or I'm a better actor than I think most people are.

(00:10:32):
So therefore, you should suspend judgment in the sense that if somebody is on your critical path, the only judgment you should make is they're on my critical path. If I want to get something done, I need their collaboration and cooperation, and the fact that I may not like them is in fact irrelevant. And as I have taught senior executives over the years, it is absolutely clear to me that one of the skills that they have mastered is they have a skill that you cannot tell what they think of you. And that's important because I need your collaboration, I need your cooperation. And if I leak out in ways that say I don't respect you or I don't like you, I don't admire you, whatever, my odds of getting you to work productively with me goes essentially to zero. So that's a judgmental story. Does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:21):
Absolutely. And I have a quote from your syllabus along these lines, "Not everyone we encounter in Paths to Power is someone you're going to want to emulate. This is a class about how to get things done, how to build and wield influence, and there are multiple ways to accomplish these objectives." So I've had two friends actually go through the course. One I asked about the course of the impact it had on her. She's actually a founder now. And she told me that your class was her single most favorite class at all of Stanford Business School, because it was realistic and applicable to life as a founder. Because it didn't sugarcoat business, didn't sugarcoat life. It told her how the world really works and it is helping her succeed with her startup right now.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:00):
Thank you. There's no higher praise than that. I actually don't read, I shouldn't probably say this on the public, but I don't actually read my course evaluations because the impact I want to have is not to have people like me, but to have that kind of impact. To make people more successful, more effective in their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
That is a good segue to one of your rules of power. So let's just talk about your Seven Rules of Power. I actually have your book right here and if folks want to learn more, here it is, Seven Rules of Power. This is your fourth book about power, and this is your best book about power, because it basically summarizes everything you've learned in a really cohesive way. So let me first share the Seven Rules of Power and then I'm going to dive into a few of them. Does that sound good?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:44):
That sounds perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:45):
Okay, so the seven rules, one, get out of your own way. Two, break the rules. Three, appear powerful. Four, build a powerful brand. Network relentlessly. Use your power, and success excuses almost...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:01):
Everything, correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):
Okay, success excuses everything almost. Got it. Okay. So let me start with power four, which is around personal brand. And the reason I want to start here is I have a friend that's actually in your class right now, Ralph, and I saw that he started a podcast. And he told me that he did it because it was part of the homework that you give students. You call it Doing Power. Is that the name of the homework assignments?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:25):
Yeah, I have. So we give them a bunch of assignments throughout the class, which are self-reflective assignments, but their big thing for the class is they have to do power. They have to do something during the quarter to take the principles of the class, and what they're learning, and put them into practice. And that is because everything I do, I do for a reason. That is because if you don't use what you learn, the learning will disappear. So if you go to a French class and you learn French, and you never speak French, in about a relatively short period of time you'll forget everything you learn. And so I want the learning to stick with them, so I try to get them to do something with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:06):
While we're on this tangent, I wanted to talk about this whole, you have a book, the Doing Knowing Gap.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:10):
Knowing-Doing Gap.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
The Knowing-Doing Gap. So let's just spend a little time there. I think that's really important. What are some examples of things that have come out of people doing these homework assignments, things that maybe led to something interesting?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:22):
Let me take my most extreme example. My most extreme example is probably Derek Kan, K-A-N. And Derek Kan was a little bit older when he went through the MBA program. And in 2012, his Doing Power project was to get appointed to be Mitt Romney's, it was Mitt Romney was running for president, to be head of economic policy for the Romney campaign. Believe it or not, he was offered the job. Believe it or not, he turned it down for reasons which we could go into if you want, but aren't that interesting. He wound up relatively soon thereafter as number three in the transportation department, working for Elaine Chao. And I have a picture of him when he comes to the class, I introduce him. I tell students, I give them a trigger warning and I introduce him. He wound up, at the end of the Trump administration, as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. And since typical of the Trump administration, by that time there was no director. He essentially ran the $6 trillion US budget. This is six years out of business school.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
I was thinking whether he got that during his class. Amazing. Okay, so this is a success story of Doing Power. Let's talk about this first power of building brand, and I think this is where people start to feel uncomfortable. They're going to be like, oh no, I don't want to be doing this. This doesn't feel good to me.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:51):
Why?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:52):
So let's talk about it.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:53):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:54):
Let's see. So talk about this power of building a personal brand.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:58):
There are by definition fewer positions at the top than at the bottom. The world, we might not like this, and I know people, the late Tony Hsieh, the Zappos tried to do holacracy or whatever, but the world is essentially hierarchical. The animal kingdom is hierarchical. It is better to be at the top than at the bottom for a number of reasons. Okay. If that is true, if there are fewer positions at the top and then at the bottom, then your job to advance your career is to figure out how to get promoted. There are many ways to get promoted, but I will guarantee you one thing, no one is going to promote Lenny if they don't know who the hell you are. So it is not sufficient for them to know who you are. They have to know that you're smart and personable and have whatever skills you've got, but they have to know you.

(00:16:52):
If they don't know you, you cannot choose what is not in your head. You know that better than I do. So therefore you have to do something to differentiate yourself. You have to build a brand. So when I think of Lenny in your podcast, I think of something. Not just 25 billion podcasts. When I think of somebody in McKinsey or Bay or BCG, one of the consulting firms, a gazillion people start off as front-line consultants. What are you going to do so that somebody knows who you are? What are you going to do that creates value for the firm and for you? So my friend Keith Ferazzi, when he started at Deloitte Consulting, did not do the spreadsheet stuff that he was, by the way, not very good at and didn't like. He started the Lincoln Quality Award. He decided to try to take Deloitte's brand recognition from about one or 2% to 30%.

(00:17:54):
He was appointed, though he left before he actually took the job, to the position of partner and the first chief marketing officer at Deloitte. I have another friend, Tristan Walker, who wanted to get hired at Foursquare. He sent emails to the founder. The founder ignored him. So Tristan Walker did something I think very bold. Tristan Walker began signing up partnerships. So one day the founder says, holy God, he signed up Starbucks. Maybe I ought to hire this guy. So you have to do something that causes people to know who you are, and that is what building a brand is about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):
It sounds very benign put that way. When people hear, I need to build a personal brand, it sounds like I need to post on LinkedIn, I need to post on Twitter, start a newsletter, start a podcast, which I know is kind of a part of it. But what are some examples you've seen of ways to build a personal brand that are effective?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:18:50):
So I have a friend who I bring to the class, a lovely tall Asian woman named Laura Chau, who made partner at a venture capital firm after four years, which is fast. Laura works for Canaan Partners, C-A-N-A-A-N. Laura said, I do not work for Andreessen Horowitz, I do not work for Sequoia, I don't work for Greylock, I don't work for any of these very visible large VC firms. So if I am going to get deals in the consumer space, that's her domain of expertise is consumer and consumer tech, somebody is going to have to know who Laura Chau is. Because again, you're not going to get the deal if nobody knows who you are. And so she basically did everything you talked about. She did writing. She started a podcast in which she invited influential people on. She contributed to a book. She helped people out.

(00:19:55):
She did networking dinners. She did everything she could so that people would recognize and know Laura Chau. And one of the things she did was she's tall. In general, Asian women are not tall. She decided to play up the fact that she was, in the words of some people, the tallest Asian woman they'd ever seen. She wears heels. In her heels she's six feet one inches tall. She also, when she comes to my class, many people come to my class with hoodies, God knows what. She has style and it's a unique style. So she thinks about very strategically, how am I going to dress? How am I going to look? How am I going to show up? How am I going to do what I need to do so that people know who I am? Obviously there's substance. If you have visibility without substance, people will know you're useless. But if you have substance without visibility, no one will know the substance that you got.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:56):
You also talk about how you can reframe this idea of not being self-promotional, but it's amplifying the impact of the team that I work with, or it's me scaling myself by sharing things I know and pointing people to it.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:11):
Absolutely, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
Awesome. Okay, let's move on to a different power. Let's talk about power one, which is getting out of your own way. Talk about what that means and how someone can work on that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:20):
Well, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one by talking about how this is the topic that makes people uncomfortable. And when something makes people uncomfortable, in general, they're going to shy away from it. So if I think power is dirty, if I think power is evil, if I think power is something I want nothing to do with, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career. So that is one way in which we get in our own way. Another way in which we get in our own way, many people suffer from what is called in the psychology literature, imposter syndrome. They believe that they were the admissions mistake at Stanford. They were the hiring mistake in whatever company they're working for. That somehow they got to this job, but they don't really deserve to be there because they're surrounded by people who are smarter and better than them, and therefore they will do things.

(00:22:18):
I can't even believe that this goes on. So I will have students, not many, but a few. Now raise their hand, I'll call them, and the first things out of their mouth will be, I don't know if this comment is going to be useful. This is called pre-emptory apology. If the comment is not going to be useful, don't say it. That's number one, but number two, don't apologize. Pardon me for interrupting. Pardon me for taking up your time. Stop all this apologizing. If you got the job you're in, you probably are not only qualified, you're probably overqualified. So don't use descriptors of yourself that disempower you. Don't think of yourself as not deserving of the job that you hold, because that attitude will leak out and other people will say, if Lenny doesn't think he deserved the job, then maybe I shouldn't think he deserves the job either.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:19):
So basically the first power is you're shooting yourself in the foot by worrying too much about whether people like you. This friend of mine who's now the founder that I read some quotes from, she said her number one takeaway from your class is if you want to be liked, get a dog.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:23:32):
That's correct. That is a quote from my dear friend Gary Loveman, who for many years ran Harrah's, which then became Caesars, the casino company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):
You also talk about this. Yeah, there's this quote I have. "Acknowledge that others are often no better than you, because that makes you feel better about the story." So for people that actually want to be liked, I like being liked. I don't know if it's a flaw in my upbringing. Is the lesson you're capped on your power if you worry about if you want to be liked?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:24:05):
At the end of the day, you don't want to be intentionally disliked. You don't want to violate my dear friend Bob Sutton's book The No Asshole Rule and gratuitously be an asshole. But you are hired to get a job done. It's interesting. I unfortunately am now too old. In the words of my chiropractor, I'm suffering from too many birthdays. So I have a lot of doctors who are doing a great job. Trust me, when I choose a doctor, I have a, unfortunately he retired, a neurosurgeon who did two surgeries on my spine. He's considered to be one of the top 20 in the country. If you go on Yelp, you read about his personality and his office furniture. As I said to somebody, he's doing microsurgery on my spine, I can wind up permanently paralyzed. I really don't care about his personality. I don't care about his office furniture.

(00:25:01):
That's an extreme example, but it makes the point. When you are put in a role, you are put in a role because presumably you are supposed to perform in that role. If you get appointed to be a head coach, if we make you a quarterback on an NFL team, or we make you center on a National Basketball Association team, you did not get that job because people thought you had a cute personality. You got that job because you have the skills to make your organization successful. And if you do not use those skills because you're worried about what everybody else is thinking, you are not only harming yourself, but you're harming them because you are not doing what you were hired to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:46):
So a simple way of thinking about this, which makes me feel better about. As we talk through this, I'm becoming less uncomfortable with these, which is a good sign. It's don't actively try to be disliked. Don't prioritize being liked, prioritize competence and respect.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:25:59):
Correct, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
And doing the thing that needs to be done.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:03):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:04):
Okay, great. Let's talk about rule number two, which is break the rules. So basically again, these powers are ways to grow power, and you're saying that if you break the rules, you get more power. Talk about why that's the case, what that looks like.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:18):
Well, for many reasons, number one, when you break the rules, you stand out. You become memorable when you do something that's unexpected. And being memorable is of course important, as we've already discussed. That's number one. Number two, the rules were made mostly by the people who are favored by the rules in place. So if we were talking about business strategy, we would talk about a word that is probably now overused. We would talk about being a disruptor. That you would disrupt an industry. And how do you disrupt an industry? By doing something that is different from the other industry incumbents. In Southwest Airlines, you don't do hub and spoke. At Amazon, you provide an incredible level of customer service. Whole Foods, you don't optimize on the cost of the stuff in your store, but you optimize on fitting local taste, whatever. You would be a disruptor, you would do things that are different.

(00:27:14):
The same principle holds for you, that if you are going to be successful, you have to do what number one, plays to your strengths, to use the title of a Gallup book. Number two, you have to do things again that cause you to stand out, and you have to do things that basically will make you more successful. One of the conventional wisdoms that people I think adhere to way too much, is don't ask. Don't ask, don't ask for help. You need to show self-sufficiency. So my colleague, Frances Flynn, Frank Flynn, wrote an article with Vanessa Lake entitled, If You Need Help, Just Ask. And it turns out people overestimate how many people they're going to have to ask to get help, and it turns out that asking for help makes people uncomfortable.

(00:28:03):
I was married, if you read the acknowledgments in Seven Rules of Power. For more than 35 years I was married to Kathleen Francis Fowler, who I could send you a picture. She looked literally like a supermodel and I never have been any particularly better looking than I am now. So somebody said to me, how'd you get her to go out with you? And the answer of course is, I asked. I asked, I asked, I asked. No one, well, maybe not no one. But few people are going to go out with you if you don't ask them out. Few people are going to marry you if you don't ask them to marry. Few people are going to do anything if you don't ask. And what is the worst that could happen? If you ask and they say, no, you are no worse off than had you not asked in the first place. If you don't ask, you're not going to get it. If you ask and they say, no, you're not going to get it. Get over your ego, ask.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:59):
Is there another example that comes to mind of someone breaking the rules say in business, that ended up being really successful as a result, or just someone that is really good at this in business?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:07):
I can give you many examples. One of my favorite examples would be Jason Calacanis. I don't know if you know Jason.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Oh yeah, I know you did a case study on him. I know him well. Yeah.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:18):
So I think Jason, I think consistently breaks all kinds of rules. First of all, when he comes to my class, nobody likes him, but that's okay. Almost nobody likes him. But...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
That's power number one. He's not worried about.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:33):
Yeah, that's number one. But also I think there's a conventional wisdom in the venture capital industry which he defies almost completely. He makes a lot of little bets, not a few big bets. He runs a very lean operation. He doesn't have a lot of partners. He doesn't have actually any partners, so he can't be fired by his partners. He began his career in journalism, which is interesting. Being a journalist is a wonderful job because you get to ask people all kinds of questions. And if you ask smart people questions, and you have some reasonable level of intelligence yourself, at the end of that process, you're going to wind up incredibly smart and incredibly insightful. And he wound up incredibly smart and insightful around aspects of the internet industry.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:23):
And he definitely has a lot of power. I think I am going to link to the case study in our show notes where you basically walk through how he went from nothing to a very powerful person.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:31):
And by the way, a very rich person as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:34):
Let's talk about another power, power five, networking relentlessly. What does that look like and how do you get better at this?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:42):
Well, I think there's research that shows that many people find networking dirty, and that's because I think they think about it in the wrong way. My friend John Levy, who has written a fabulous book, You're Invited. Which is a book about how to put on events that people want to come to. Is a fabulous human being. Will tell you that the first principle of networking is in fact generosity. It's generosity. What can I do for you? How can I be helpful? Who can I introduce you to? Either a company or a product or a person who can be helpful to you in your career.

(00:31:20):
But in order to be able to introduce you to someone who's going to be useful to you, I have to know people. If I don't know anybody, I can't introduce you to anybody. And the more people I know, the more likely it will be that if you say, I need to know somebody in X, I will know that person. So the broader your social network, the more people and the more things you will know. If knowledge is power, networking is a fabulous way to get knowledge about people and about ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
It's funny to hear this where it's like, yes, obviously this is right, but connecting it to if you want to become more powerful, more successful, you need to do this. I think that is a powerful point that we're all making here, is just like this actually is necessary if you want to acquire more power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:32:10):
Of course. I have a funny story about networking. So we have a thing in Stanford called View From The Top, in which these fancy people come in and give a talk. And one of the people came in and give a talk and made my class instantly popular, because he's an extraordinarily wealthy person. His name is Omid Kordestani, and so I reached out to him and I said, "Omid, let's have breakfast." So I can understand because during the thing, when somebody asked them what class was the most important in his success, he said mine. So I said, "Tell me your story." He said, "Well, I graduated from Stanford. I'm Persian in background, immigrant background. An engineer, HP, all the things that would make you kind of a nerd or something." He said, "I went to work for a couple of startups that didn't do well. Then I found myself in the mid-nineties at Netscape." The browser company, big deal. Anyway, Marc Andreessen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:07):
Oh yeah.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:33:08):
Okay. "So I found myself in Netscape in marketing and business development. I was not making any progress. One day I decided to take your class to an extreme. I decided to stop doing my job." So I said, "When people gave you projects to do or assignments or tasks and you didn't do them?" He said, "It turns out that I spent my time, not obviously at the bar, but in networking first with people inside of Netscape. And it turns out if you're well-connected to the senior leaders, they don't really care if you do your job or not. That's number one. Number two," he said, "oftentimes I can find other people to do the work I was doing. So instead of basically spending time doing my job, I networked first within Netscape." But Netscape was not that big of a company. So after a while he decided to go through, which is by the way, his job anyway, in marketing and business, he decided to basically drive through the Silicon Valley talking to people. And this is the rest of the browsers are just beginning.

(00:34:14):
Nobody knows what a browser is, nobody knows what the internet is going to become. So he's having all these fabulous conversations. All right, so he now knows basically everybody. It's 1998 and a little tiny company decides 10 engineers, typical Silicon Valley company. 10 engineers, all engineers. I have a friend who went to work for a company, run a company that had 26 people. He didn't have one sales and marketing person. Anyway, the company now has 10 engineers. They decide they need to hire their first business person. Being an analytically oriented company, they say, we're going to do this very analytically. We are basically going to ask everybody we can think of, and a few people we can't. Give us a list of the best technically oriented business people that you know. And there is of course one name that appears on every list. It is Omid Kordestani who becomes employee number 11 at Google and makes two and a half billion dollars.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:13):
Great success from networking. Well done. When people hear about networking, it just feels like you said, very cringe. I don't want to go to these networking events and try to pretend to talk and care about people. Do you have any advice for just how to make networking feel less cringy?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:35:28):
One of the exercises I give my students is I say, write a list of 10 people who, if you knew them and if they knew you, would be important for whatever you're trying to accomplish in your career. So maybe you're trying to get into biotech, you need to know 10 executives in biotech or whatever. Make a list of 10 people. Then for each person figure out how you are going to meet them. By the way, not necessarily in a network event. Maybe you want to do what John Levy does, which is hold dinners. In which by the way, the guests do the cooking, which is a very interesting idea. That of course taps into the IKEA effect. You always like something better if you participate in creating it. Maybe you want to hold dinners, maybe you want to try to reach out to them at lunch.

(00:36:21):
Maybe you want to reach out to them and say, here's an article I think you'd be interested in. Here is somebody who I think you'd benefit from meeting. So recently, I'm not a particularly good networker, though I'm better I guess than some people. I recently met Esther Wojcicki, I'm sure I killed her name. She's considered the grandmother of Silicon Valley. She's Susan Wojcicki's mother. And she is interested in depression, particularly depression among teenagers. And I said, you should know Leanne Williams, who's in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Science Department, who has done probably 300 articles on depression and has invented something which is called Precision Psychiatry. So I connected them to each other. Just send an email. I think you ought to know each other. They got together. I get credit for knowing people and connecting them, but I also benefit them. Leanne needs to raise money. Esther's got money. Esther needs to understand the cutting edge research in depression and biomarkers of depression, which is what Leanne's specialty is, so they benefit. So this is not some icky thing. This is connecting people who benefit from being connected.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):
That touches on something you teach in the book is, in your networking you want to become a broker, you want to be central. That's kind of what you want to work on. Can you talk a bit about what that means?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:37:47):
Well, that means you want to connect people. So many people with benefits, and many groups with benefits for being connected, and they're not connected. What does a venture capitalist do? Connects people with ideas to people with money, and takes a fee for doing it. What does an investment banker do? Connects people trying to sell businesses or raise capital with people trying to buy businesses or who have capital. What's a real estate agent do? Connects buyers and sellers of houses. There are all kinds of examples where the person's entire job is connecting people. But even for the people whose job it isn't, you benefit from knowing people. The more people you know, the more things you know. As I sometimes say in my class, if leadership management, call it what you will, is getting things done through other people, it seems like common sense that the more other people you know, the more you'll be able to get done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):
As someone that has become central to a lot of things in the product world, and has built a large network as a result of this podcast newsletter, I can tell you a thousand percent. This creates a lot of opportunity and power, you could say in quotes. So I've seen it happen.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:39:00):
Of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:03):
This episode is brought to you by Heap, the product analytics solution that shows you everything users do on your digital product, website, mobile product or other digital services.

(00:40:10):
Another lesson I guess you teach is to pursue weak ties. Talk a bit about what that means. What do you mean by that?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:40:14):
Well, the people to whom you are strongly tied, your family, your spouse, significant other, your friends, the people who work with you at work will probably, because they are close to you, know the same things and the same people that you do. So to the extent that you build ties with people who are more different from you in every dimension, you are more likely to learn non-redundant information, and come in contact with people that you don't already know. This again seems common sense. There's a lot of research behind it. Mark Granovetter, a sociologist who still teaches at Stanford, wrote a book entitled The Strength of Weak Ties.

(00:40:59):
And basically, no, actually, pardon me. He wrote an article called The Strength of Weak Ties. His book was called Getting a Job. And he did a study, I guess it was at that time in Boston. He did a study of job seekers in Massachusetts, and he looked at people who got jobs through applying to ads, through more formal means. And then he looked at people who got jobs through referrals from their network. And it turns out, of course, the jobs that you get through your network referrals are much better jobs. And oftentimes the best jobs that people got were referred to them by people that were not particularly close to them. Because they had a view, that's the word I was looking for, a view into the ecosystem of the Boston labor market, that the other people didn't have because they weren't in the same place as the other people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
I love that lesson. Let's talk about another power, which is using your power. So when people think of using your power builds more power, that's not intuitive. You talk about how it creates this self-perpetuating growth of power the more you practice power. Can you talk a bit about that?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:42:16):
Sure. So when you are given, it's interesting, my friend Deborah Gruenfeld, who wrote a book called Acting with Power, talks a lot about people's ambivalence to power. So sometimes people are put in a job. Herminia Ibarra who teaches now at London Business School, at one point taught in Seattle, at one point taught at Harvard, has an article in the Harvard Business Review in which she talks about a woman in a drug company who gets a promotion, and says to her colleagues, to whom she's now overseeing, that she's not sure why she got the job. She's not sure she deserves the job. Needless to say, she didn't do very well in this job because she got in her own way. But part of this is you are put in a position of power. You're put in a position of authority in order to make things happen. So to the extent you mobilize your resources and get things to happen, you'll get more resources.

(00:43:14):
People want to be associated with success. To the extent that you become successful, more people will want to work with you. To the extent that you get more stuff done, you'll get more promotions, more opportunities. Nobody's going to give you a job to do if the last five jobs like that they gave you, you couldn't get done. So the more you are able to do, which oftentimes of course requires power and influence, the more you're able to do, the more you'll be asked to do. But better yet, the more resources you'll be given to help you get things done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:48):
And I think there's interestingly you teach that just showing that you have power creates more power. People see that you have this power and they start to follow your lead more, right? That's a part of this.

# 5 essential questions to craft a winning strategy | Roger Martin (author, advisor, speaker)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Why are so many people bad at strategy?

Roger Martin (00:00:02):
What's taught now in business schools generally sucks. People aren't prepared educationally, and they sure don't get prepared for it in companies. It's intellectually challenging and it's emotionally intimidating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You have something you call the strategy choice cascade.

Roger Martin (00:00:18):
You have to have answers to five questions. What's your winning aspiration? Where to play? How can you win? What capabilities do you have to have that your competitors don't? And then, what enabling management systems do you have to put in place? For the most part, in the leading business schools, it's illegal to teach that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
Playing to win, you talked about, and there's kind of these two routes.

Roger Martin (00:00:38):
You have to be either differentiated or low cost, there's no way to protect yourself if you're not one of those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
Is there anything else you wanted to just leave listeners with?

Roger Martin (00:00:46):
I have never met this mythical beast called a great natural strategist. Great strategists have all one thing in common, they just practice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Today, my guest is Roger Martin. Roger is one of the world's most trusted strategy advisors. He's professor emeritus at the Rotman School of Management, at the University of Toronto, where he served as dean for five years. In 2013, he was named Global Dean of the Year, and in 2017 he was named the world's number one management thinker by Thinkers50. He's also the author of what many listeners consider their favorite book on strategy, called, Playing to Win. I've gotten a lot of requests to get Roger on this podcast, and I can now see why. This is the most tactical and fascinating conversation I've had on this podcast about developing a strategy, and that is a really high bar.

(00:01:38):
We delve into the five questions that you need to answer to help you craft your strategy. How Hamilton Helmer, Michael Porter, and Richard Rumelt's work fits into his framework and worldview, what people most often get wrong when they're developing their own strategy, the two options you have for how to win with your strategy, a very tactical and simple trick for getting started, thinking through your strategy, and so much more. This episode is for anyone who is trying to build their strategic thinking muscle. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app, or YouTube, it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Roger Martin.

(00:02:21):
Roger, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Roger Martin (00:02:24):
It's great to be here, Lenny, thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:27):
What I want to try to do with our time together is to help people that are on the ground at a company, say, like the product manager, designer, engineer, data scientists, folks that aren't necessarily the CO, or the founder or exec at company get better at product strategy. At crafting a strategy, evaluating strategy, developing a strategy. Because it feels like there's always tons of advice for the leaders of a company, but less for people on the ground doing the thing. And I feel like, luckily, your stuff applies to everyone. So, how does that sound as a lens for-

Roger Martin (00:02:55):
That sounds great, and can I tell us a little story to that end?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:58):
Please.

Roger Martin (00:02:58):
So, recently there was a newspaper article saying that, pointing out that 10% of the S&P 500 CEOs, 10% are ex Proctor and Gamble people. It's an amazing number, like a stunningly high, high number. Why would that possibly be? I believe it's because at Procter and Gamble there is a view that people way down the organization, like let's just say the head and shoulders brand franchise leader, who reports to the head of shampoos and conditioners, who reports to the head of beauty care, who reports to the CEO, so at least four levels down in the organization, in the guts of the organization, Proctor understands that that individual, not the CEO, not the global president of beauty care, not the head of haircare, not the head of shampoos and conditioners, the brand manager makes super important strategic choices, and if they don't make them well, the brand does terribly. And so, I believe... And not many companies have enough of that attitude.

(00:04:13):
So, I'm a big believer that people down organization have to make really important strategic choices or bad things are going to happen, if they make really great ones, good things are going to happen, and they get trained to be a CEO someday. So, I'm with your thesis. But yours is counter, what I would say is normal. What is most normal is people at the top do strategy, and people down below do something, and it's usually called execution, and I hate that, I hate that term of art, for what it's worth. And so, I think you and I are singing from a bit of the same songbook, even if it's a minority songbook.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
This episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset, it should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions. That's business 101. But here's a number for you, 54% of leaders say web updates take too long. That's over half of you listening right now. That's where Webflow comes in. Their visual first platform allows you to build, launch, and optimize webpages fast. That means you can set ambitious business goals and your site can rise to the challenge.

(00:05:43):
This episode is brought to you by Work os. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication, and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOs, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale, while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.

It's a drop-in replacement for auth zero, and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at Workos.com to learn more. That's Workos.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
I just want to ask this broad question about strategy, why is strategy so hard? Why are so many people bad at strategy?

Roger Martin (00:07:09):
Perhaps the thing that makes it intellectually hardest is that it is an integrative activity. It answers to a bunch of questions that have to fit together and reinforce one another. So, that just makes it a little more complicated, it's not like saying, Lenny, what do you want for lunch? It's saying, Lenny, what kind of diet do you want that'll keep you healthy? And that includes breakfast, lunch, dinners, snacks, a whole bunch of other things that you got to fit together. So, it makes that harder to do intellectually. Another aspect of it is, it is intimidating. Strategy involves making choices to do some things and not other things, and it is often intimidating to say, oh dear, I have to cut these things off, and not do them, and actually make a decision that I'll be held accountable for potentially, or I'll even hold myself accountable for.

(00:08:21):
So, that's a second thing. It's harder emotionally, not harder intellectually. And then, there's the training aspect of it, the knowledge aspect of it, which is, what's taught now in strategy in business schools generally sucks. It's gone on a crazy theoretical bend, the strategy academy as a whole has fallen in love with a theory called the resource-based theory of the firm, that silly and nobody uses it out in the world. And so, students are no longer trained on useful strategy. And the other feeder into people learning strategy were the strategy consulting firms, but the strategy consulting firms, the so-called strategy consulting firms, do almost no strategy anymore because it's a little business compared to post-merger integration, digital transformation, and a bunch of other things. So, people aren't prepared educationally for it, and if they're not prepared educationally for it, then they sure don't get prepared for it in companies. It's intellectually challenging and it's emotionally intimidating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:40):
On this point, you made about how schools are teaching strategy wrong, how do you describe what the wrong approach is?

Roger Martin (00:09:46):
It's a theory that's sort of taken over, called the resource-based view of the firm, that was... In the world of academics, there's a weird place where the number one emotion is jealousy, and people were massively jealous of Mike Porter, who created many of the most important concepts of strategy when he wrote a book, Competitive Strategy, in 1980. And so, they needed to counter him because they just didn't like the fact that he was so prominent, and they decided they would say he was about positioning. So, they called his the positioning school, and they caricatured what he said, which he never did, but they said he said it's all about finding a place that is structurally attractive, and then milking it for everything you can.

(00:10:43):
We at the resource-based view of the firm think that strategy is all about building resources. And if you build resources, it's almost like if you build it, they will come. And that's what you should pay attention to. Now, the problem is, any resource that may be useful somewhere is not necessarily useful elsewhere. So, it begs the question, how would you think through what resources to invest in building? What would be a way of doing that, investing here, versus here, versus here? It's silent on that because it's a dumb theory, and it doesn't have anything useful to say, in my view, about that.

(00:11:33):
And so, when the students go out and say to their company, I'm going to do a VRIO analysis, or a VRIN, some people just roll their eyes at them, and so it doesn't get used. I've only seen it used, I've been in consulting companies for 42 years, and I've seen it used once. And the trust, as is usually the case, is that it's both. And that's why the model I use for strategies says a lot about where you play is important, that's one of the key questions, and your capabilities are important, and you've got to link those things together. But that's, for the most part in the leading business schools, it's illegal to teach that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:20):
Illegal to teach your approach.

Roger Martin (00:12:23):
Yes. I couldn't teach my approach at my own business school.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:23):
What?

Roger Martin (00:12:26):
But when I was dean, the most powerful person, the departments, or areas as we call it, like strategic management is an area, they have 100% control over what's taught in strategic management, in finance, et cetera. The dean may be the most powerful person in the school, and I happened to be a super successful dean, so if anything, I was a super powerful dean, and students would beg me, they'd say, "Roger, you have 20 years of experience, you're sort of a famous consultant in strategy, and you've got these theories, please teach a course in it." Nope. I did do extracurricular stuff, where I had practice of one Saturday a year, teaching everything I knew to anybody who wanted to show up. But for credit, I was not allowed. And if you try to get a job at any business... The only exception might be Harvard Business School, maybe. But if you took the 49 other top business schools in America, and if asked the question, do you swear allegiance to the resource-based view of the firm? If you don't answer an enthusiastic yes, you have no chance of being hired, zero.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:50):
Wow. This academia drama, I had no idea.

Roger Martin (00:13:54):
A loyalty test.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:55):
This is unreal. Makes me even more excited to dive into your world, and your ways of seeing things. Before we do that, just we've had a few other strategy people on the podcast, it might be helpful to frame where they fit in the spectrum that you're describing. So-

Roger Martin (00:14:09):
Oh, okay. I may not know all of them, but you give me-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:12):
I imagine you do. So, we've had a Hamilton Helmer on the podcast, and then Richard Rumelt on the podcast. How do they relate, just for people to get into your stuff versus this dogma?

Roger Martin (00:14:25):
So, one of them is an academic, and one of them is a quasi-academic, or non-academic, like me. I was a tenured professor for many years, but don't consider myself an academic guy. I don't think Hamilton does, though I've never asked him-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:41):
He's an investor now.

Roger Martin (00:14:41):
... that question. Yeah. So, he's written a very, I think, useful book that would in some sense fit into my how to win box, right? I say strategies about how to win, and he has a, what I call, a categorical model. Here are categories of things that you should think about. If you're trying to win, here are seven ways of winning, and I categorize him as a non-academic practical strategy guy. Richard Rumelt is a now retired Tuck professor, and he is this hyper competition thing that he does. He also is of the, I'm jealous of Mike Porter kind of thing. So, I've got to say, Mike Porter is wrong, and here's how I am so right, and the competition doesn't take place in the way Mike says, where it's really stable, and whatever, it's really hyper competition, Mike Porter never in his entire life has said competition is stable, he's repeatedly said the opposite.

(00:15:54):
But in order to say I'm not like Mike Porter, and in fact, I distinguish myself by saying he's wrong, and I'm right, and so... I don't know. He seemed like a fine guy. I don't think that he, like most business academics, he doesn't know much about business. He hasn't gone out and practiced a lot. He came to our school, and gave a lecture because people loved hyper competition because he would blast Mike Porter, and he gave a example of Proctor and Gamble, I've been consulting at Proctor and Gamble, and know everything about Procter and Gamble, basically.

(00:16:42):
And what he said about Proctor and Gamble had zero to do with reality, like zero. It was just completely, utterly, absolutely wrong. And I asked him afterwards, just sort of like, "Why do you say that?" And he said, "Well, I think that's the way it worked." Are you kidding me? So, I'm not a fan of that piece of work. I would say it doesn't fit nicely into research-based view of the firm versus Mike Porter, it's sort of like, here's another lens to take on the world, and I'm going to take that lens, everything's hyper-competitive, and here's how you think about hyper-competition.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:32):
This is fascinating. I love that we're spending some time on this, this is really helpful to hear the landscape of strategy minds. Okay, let's dive into your worldview, and maybe the simplest way is just, how do you define strategy? What is a strategy?

Roger Martin (00:17:48):
Strategy is an integrated set of choices that compels desired customer action. So, the way I think about it is, there's a whole bunch of things a company controls, how many factories to build, how much R&D to do, in what areas, and how much advertising to do, how many people to hire, what to pay them, blah, blah, blah... Those are all the things under our control. What, Lenny, is the thing we have almost no control over? What, if we're a company?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:19):
What customers do.

Roger Martin (00:18:21):
Yeah. We would like them to take some of these out of their pocket and give them to us, can we make them? No, we can't. So, essentially, the job of strategy is to make decisions on the things we do control that will compel, we can't force, but it'll compel them. They'll say, gosh, I should take my hard-earned cash, and whether it's a company or an individual, I should take my hard-earned cash and give it to you, rather than give it to nobody, if there's no product now, or give it to a competitive product. So, the important pieces of it is integrated, it's the whole set of choices that has that one outcome, that it compels desired customer action.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:11):
Amazing. Okay. And to help people define their strategy, you have something you call the strategy choice cascade, which is basically five questions that you need to answer to help you think trough strategy. Can you talk through this?

Roger Martin (00:19:23):
Yeah. And this is the fruits of many, many years of doing strategy work, and trying to figure out, how do you do this thing? Because the fun thing was, I was in the era, I started in strategy in 1981, and that was early in the era, strategy was born in 1963 with the founding of Boston Consulting Group by Bruce Henderson, who was the father of strategy in my view, of practical commercial strategy. So, it was still in the early days, and Bruce Henderson had a theory of how strategy should... What result it should produce for you. Mike Porter then came along in 1980, so '63 Bruce Anderson, and '80 Porter, the two most important figures in the history of strategy, came along and said, a strategy has to look like this. It has to have this as its output. But neither of them was very good on, because again, it was early, they can't do everything right away, of, well, how would you get one of those?

(00:20:34):
So, Mike Porter says you have to be either differentiated or low cost. Good. And if you look through competitive strategy as landmark seminal book, to say, how would you do that? There is no answer. And because Monitor Company, the firm I was one of the leaders of for a decade and a half, was founded essentially to commercialize Mike Porter's work, customers would ask us, they'd say, well, we like Mike Porter, and we'd like to have one of those. We can look at ourselves under his framework, and we can say we're stuck in the middle, and he said, that's bad, and he said, good is this or this. How do we think through creating one of those? We didn't actually have an answer.

(00:21:22):
And it turned out, because I was the most, I don't know, intellectually engaged on this, and didn't mind the hard work of product development from about 1987, when we discovered we really didn't know that, and clients really wanted us to tell them that. Between 1987 and 1995, I did all this work on, well, how could you develop a process for getting yourself one of those, one of those excellent strategies? And I came to the view that you have to have answers to five questions. You have to have an answer to the question of, what's your winning aspiration? What are you trying to accomplish? Because it'll help contextualize the kinds of choices you could make. Then there's a where to play, on what playing field, or if you're like military stuff, battlefield, are you going to plop yourself down on? You're not going to play everywhere, in every product, at every vertical stage around the world, you're going to pick someplace, and in that place, how can you be either better than competitors, in terms of creating customer value, or lower cost than those competitors?

(00:22:38):
To win there, where you've chosen to play to meet your winning aspirations, what capabilities do you have to have that your competitors don't, that would enable you to win that way? And then, what management systems, enabling management systems, do you have to put in place to make sure you build and maintain those must have capabilities to win, where you've chosen to play, to meet your winning aspiration? And so, I came to the conclusion, actually it was in 1995, the end of an eight-year journey, I came to the conclusion those were the five, and you had to do them together, and that is the essence of producing a strategy that compels desired customer action.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:21):
I want to go through an example of a company, but before we do that, something I think that's important to talk about is, if your book is called Playing to Win, you talked about this idea of you need to play to win, and you argue that a lot of people are just playing to play, they're playing to play the game. I'm guessing most people listening, and most people developing a strategy, don't think they're doing that, they don't think they're just playing to play the game. They think they're playing to win. I'm curious what are signs that you're not actually playing to win?

Roger Martin (00:23:49):
It would be mainly signs given to you by customers. So, if you say, we're the most innovative company in our industry, and customers... And let's say the industry distributes through a given channel, and customers come into that channel and they look at the two products and say, I could flip a coin on this one, you are not effectively playing to win. Maybe you thought you were winning, but customers don't think you are better. Or if your competitor lowers their price compared to your price, and you say to yourself, oh my God, if we lowered our price, we would make no money, but your competitor keeps on pricing there, you may think you have the low cost position, but they do, and you have to give them whatever share they desire at that lower price because you can't compete there.

(00:24:56):
So, you'll know you're playing to play if you're not aiming to, and accomplishing, having either an offer where Lenny walks into the store, whatever kind of store it is, and says to the person in the store, I want that brand. An example, Lego, one of the companies I've worked with for a long time, great company. It turns out that if you do market research on kids, a store that purports to be a toy store but that doesn't have Lego is not a toy store. They would define it as not a toy. Mom, why are we here? I wanted to go to a toy store. And she said, but it says toys on here. And the kids said, uh-huh. That's an insane brand. That's an insane, insane, insane brand.

(00:25:54):
And it has a price premium for anything, over any of its competitors by a long shot. It keeps growing, it actually for most years in the last decade it has had 80 or 90% of the entire category growth is Lego. And so, they're playing to win, to be distinctive in the minds of consumers. But Vanguard has got $9 trillion of assets under management last time I checked. Does it do anything distinctive? Not really. The customer bought, do they have the lowest cost position so they can charge the lowest AUMs? Absolutely. And so, there's different kinds of ways, but you'd know by the actions that customers take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:48):
So, essentially, to mirror back what you're saying, to win, there's kind of these two routes you talk about. One is you're the lowest cost option, the second is you're differentiated. You have a differentiated brand, where it's not a coin flip, it's like, oh, I really need that for this reason.

Roger Martin (00:27:02):
Yes. Yeah, you got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):
And if you can't do that, then the advice you share is go find a different playing field.

Roger Martin (00:27:11):
Well, or get out of business, whatever... It's only a matter of time until you're dead, is the sad truth of the matter, which is the competitors in your industry, who are either low cost or differentiated, can essentially jerk you around as much as they want. It's like Southwest Airlines, right? Southwest Airlines was just a tiny little airline that flew Austin, Houston, Dallas, and now it's number one in passenger seat miles in America, and the only airline that's earned its cost of capital over the last half century, all the rest are losing money for their shareholders over time. They have good cycles and bad cycles. How did that happen? Well, it's just the other airlines had to step aside whenever Southwest came into a route, the other airlines just had to say, well, I guess you're going to get your 30 share, or 35 share of passengers on this route, welcome to town. That's all they can do.

(00:28:15):
They just have to seed position. And that's what happens, if you play to play, you'll end up just being... It's literally like having a bully who can just shove you, and you take one step back, then they shove you, and you take another step back, and they shove you, and you take another step back. There's no way to protect yourself if you're not one of those two. You cannot bully Vanguard, you cannot bully Southwest, you cannot bully Proctor and Gamble, you cannot bully Lego. That's the way the business world works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:54):
And in the case of Southwest, the reason they couldn't be bullied is they were the low cost provider and the other airlines couldn't meet their prices. So, they're like, all right, there's nothing we can do.

Roger Martin (00:29:04):
Yep, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:04):
Awesome.

Roger Martin (00:29:06):
So, while I was living in Boston, they entered the Boston to Chicago route, which was a duopoly of American and United at the time, and the price was about, in those days, a $1000 for a round trip because it was a nice duopoly. When Southwest come in, they say, we're going to fly Providence to Midway, not Logan to O'Hare, and it's going to be $200. And they had great advertising, I always loved the advertising that they had when they entered the, they did maps of Boston, and said, if you live in any of these places, kind of the south, the west of Boston, it takes you less time to get from your house to the gate than it does to go to Logan.

(00:29:56):
Because at Logan, you park in a parking garage, and then walk a half an hour, and then when you get through security, you still have to walk 20 minutes... Blah, blah, blah. And at Providence, if you've ever flown out of Providence, you can park about 100 yards from the gates. And so, they just had to say, we can't stop that, not everybody's going to do it, but a whole bunch of people are, and there's nothing we can do to stop that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:24):
What I love is we're already diving into these five questions. So we've been mostly talking about how we will win, basically, here's your options to win. Low cost provider, or be differentiated, or find a different place to win. Let me summarize the five again. What is our winning aspiration? Where will we play? How will we win? What capabilities must we have in place to win? And what management systems are required to make sure the capabilities are in place?

Roger Martin (00:30:44):
Right. You've got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Okay, cool.

Roger Martin (00:30:46):
You're a very quick study my friend.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:48):
I got some notes here. So, coming back to the how will we win? Because I think everyone's listening to this, okay, cool, we got two ways to win, we're going to be the cheapest or we're going to differentiate, okay. Okay, how do we differentiate? Is there a taxonomy of options that you think about or tell people, what are the ways and options for exploring, here's how we will be different?

Roger Martin (00:31:04):
It is mainly understanding customers, as well as you can, and then saying, is there a way to be distinctive against that? And there are lots of ways to do it, but it's tied very closely to the capabilities, which is, if you have a way of winning, you say, my where to play is I'm going to sell pet food on the internet, and my how to win is I'm going to be the best. But it turns out that anybody who can build a website can sell pet food on the internet, and in fact, 20 of them do it almost immediately, and they all go bust. You don't have the capability, so you've got to ask yourself the question, can I serve a particular customer need with a set of capabilities that are going to be hard to replicate by my competitors? They either can't do it, or they won't do it. And both are important questions because sometimes it won't.

(00:32:20):
Do you really think Walmart couldn't have built as good a website as Amazon, and at massive scale? I think they could have, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:30):
Yeah, probably. I don't know.

Roger Martin (00:32:33):
Did they? They didn't. They said, I hope this online thing doesn't really take off because that would be a pisser because we've got 5,000 stores across America, and we've got all that, and that would be a bummer. And so, they don't do anything for 10 years, giving Amazon the scale, so that Amazon then has this huge scale advantage on this, and network effects, and voila, you've got a competitive advantage that you didn't necessarily completely deserve. You needed the help of the player who stood to lose the most to hope that it wasn't going to happen. Same with Tesla, Tesla got a 10 year headstart, not because the OEMs couldn't, they could have, and of course GM did many, many years ago, create a fully functioning electric vehicle. But they couldn't figure out how the hell you make a buck on it, and so they didn't do it, giving Tesla the ability to establish a brand that people associate with that, electric vehicle equals Tesla, and allow them to jump way ahead, and then have the scale that is hard to hard for others to match.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:54):
You said something that's really interesting that I think is also really important, which is, you said that just being the best or better is not a solution. You can have a better pet food, you implied that's not going to get you there. Can you talk a bit about that?

Roger Martin (00:34:06):
Yeah. You have to answer a second question I guess, which is, here's the way I'm going to be better, and here's the way somebody else isn't going to be able to simply replicate that quickly. One of my favorite businesses, because I was on the board of Thomson Reuters for 14 years, it was Thomson first and then they bought Reuters, so Thomson Reuters. Best business is a business called Westlaw, and it's the dominant provider of online legal searches. So, if you're a litigator, and you're trying to, you're getting ready for a case, and you need to know what are the important precedents for this case, you go on to Westlaw, and put in some search terms using a Westlaw keyword system to help with it, and you get the five cases that really matter. You can Google it, and do the same thing, and you'll get the 500 cases that might matter.

(00:35:11):
How does Westlaw do that? Well, for now over 100 years, they've taken every case that's come out of the US legal system, had a lawyer, a Westlaw lawyer, write a head note that summarizes what's in the case, using these keywords so that they were searchable, and today, to do 2024, takes 1500 full-time lawyers. So, if somebody else said, this Westlaw business is incredibly profitable, and it keeps growing, and it's awesome, I'd like to be in that business... All they'd have to do is hire 150,000 lawyers full time, and you'd have to create a numbering system and a keyword system that's different than Westlaw's, and then you'd have to do what Westlaw has done for the past 50 years, which is give it free to law schools so that they teach their students before they even get out how to use Westlaw, and all...

(00:36:14):
No probs. That'll be easy, right? Nobody's even tried. Why bother? Life's too short. And that's the kind of capabilities you need to be able to say we'll win by having the searches that make the lawyer's job the most effective. And if it saves them time, it saves them money. And you don't need a huge law library. Law firms used to have these huge law libraries, you don't need one, you need a terminal, or actually, now it's on everybody's PC. And you don't need a bunch of librarians to go and find the cases that you need, they pop up on your screen. That's a great case of competitive advantage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:02):

(00:38:12):
So, essentially, we're talking about moats. What are some moat that you can create where people can't just copy what you're doing?

Roger Martin (00:38:18):
And Warren Buffett likes that terminology, right? That's what he says, he invests in moats.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:25):
Yeah.

Roger Martin (00:38:25):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:25):
I'll find the quote we used in a recent podcast episode, but he's like, castles with moats. And maybe along those lines, is there a way you think about types of barriers to recreate capabilities? It's like, here's the options we have, is it like... Essentially, the seven powers I think talks about this.

Roger Martin (00:38:43):
Yeah. Yeah. That's why I like Helmer, because he categorizes them. And I've got to look into it some more because I haven't studied it to say whether I would concur that there are just seven, or there are more. My suspicion might be that there are more, but there may not be. They may be all clustered, there may be variants that cluster behind those. But I don't, myself, have a categorization scheme that says, here's how you search for the moat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:20):
Great. That would be nice. So, here's the quote from Buffet, by the way, "I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."

Roger Martin (00:39:27):
Yes, I like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):
There we go.

Roger Martin (00:39:30):
I like that. And he's smart, he's consistent. Though, everybody makes mistakes, right? And he did too. Solomon Brothers, US Air... Anybody who thinks they can be perfect on strategy is delusional. And so, even the very, very best, like a Warren Buffet, who's outstanding, arguable genius, is going to sort of think, I think this is a moat, and it's going to be ephemeral. But any of us should be pleased to have a track record that would be anywhere close to that, on really identifying moats, because he has.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:11):
We talked about that with Hamilton Helmer, that every startup deck has, here's our moats, here's how we're going to have barriers to entry, and they're all delusional, rarely is there ever an actual moat, especially in the early stages.

Roger Martin (00:40:22):
Yes. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
Let's go back to the five questions again, because that's so core to the way you think about strategy. What do you think about using, say this FigJam as an example, as a hypothetical, just to think through questions that they might ask to think about strategy, and I can describe what FigJam is so you [inaudible 00:40:38]-

Roger Martin (00:40:38):
Sure, sure. I do not know that product-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:40):
Okay. It's basically a visual whiteboard collaboration tool, where people can put in sticky notes, and put little mocks, and kind of play around with all the cursors.

Roger Martin (00:40:46):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:47):
And so, it's for brainstorming, and ideation, and things like that, and laying out concept.

Roger Martin (00:40:52):
Gotcha. Okay, that would make sense for Figma.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):
Figma. Yeah, exactly.

Roger Martin (00:40:55):
Right. Okay. So, you'd asked the question, what are we trying to accomplish? Are we attempting to create something where nothing digital exists, people do this in pen and paper, and so we're trying to invent a category and then be transformative by making the user experience better? Is that what we're trying to do? Or are there players already doing this and they're just not doing it very well? You'd want to say, well, what are we trying to accomplish? And I don't spend a whole lot of time on that because you got to toggle back and forth between those five questions, but you have to have a reason for searching in a given space for where to play, how to win. What do you think their reason for thinking FigJam is worth investing in is? What do you think it is? Is it white space, or is it crummy offerings in the market currently?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:03):
If I had to get to it, I think they're trying to expand their market and they have a stronghold in design tooling, and there's this adjacent market for product teams broadly to be using Figma more. And there are existing tools similar to that, that are good.

# A framework for PM skill development | Vikrama Dhiman (Gojek)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:07):
I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things. What you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:22):
Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc? You must have that impact through the artifacts that you work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
I'm curious what you found most impedes people's career growth.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:37):
How you view change, whether you are focusing on things you control, and third is how you see yourself. The moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):

Vikrama, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:00):
Thank you for inviting me, Lenny. I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:03):
So as you know and hopefully as listeners know, I'm on this quest to meet the most insightful product leaders from all over the world and your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia. And you're also the third guest from Gojek, so there's definitely something in the water over there and I want to talk about that. To just dive right in, you have a very strong reputation for building incredibly strong product talent and also design talent, and also helping people transition from other roles into product management, which a lot of people listening to this podcast dream to do. So I'm going to ask a bunch of questions around this area. How does that sound?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:47):
Sounds good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
Okay. First question is just when you think back to the people that have done best in the product management role and have had a rapid career rise, what are some of the most common traits or behaviors or habits that you find in these people?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:05:05):
Over the last decade and a half, I've had the opportunity to work with some really strong product managers, learn from strong product managers, and some of them have had rapid career growth. When I was younger and I was starting off, I used to think it's all about the product. If you've got a really cool product to work on, your growth's guaranteed. And if you got really a product which no one cares about or a stream which no one cares about, then your growth is going to be slightly slower. But as I started seeing more and more product managers at their craft, I saw that working on a cool product area is not the only thing. In fact, sometimes some product managers would come back and complain that despite their product doing really well, they've not really grown.

(00:05:51):
And while some other product managers whose product didn't have the impact really grew. And as I started looking at it and as I started making notes, as I started talking to other product leaders, what I discovered was that the really strong product managers who were also growing in their careers did some things differently. And based on that, I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things, and I call it three W's. So what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? The really strong product managers are good at usually two of the three things. The ones who rise and when they are rising, they are performing well on all the three access. So if you would like, let's talk a little bit more about each one of these W's.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):
Yeah, I would love to. I love that you put the word what at the top and that makes it the three W's, which is clever because I find even if the acronym is not necessary, it's really helpful to help people remember so I totally respect what you did there. So the three is what you produce, what you bring to the table and what your operating model is. Is that right?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:09):
Yes, absolute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
Okay, cool. Yeah, let's talk about these.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:11):
So what you produce, a lot of people index on the impact while and they start thinking about goals, they start thinking about direction and they start thinking about strategy. While it is important to know at what stage of the career you are and what kind of a product that you are working on, the very first thing that anyone, when you're starting off, produces is outputs, okay? The output can be launching a product, it can be analyzing and running an experiment, and it could even be just being a part of the team and contributing to a go-to market strategy. So focus on that output significantly. As you get comfortable with output and you start getting comfortable with working with different stakeholders, you start controlling what outputs are necessary, which is when you move to the outcomes. Outcomes are product areas, goals that you can own and or collaborate with other stakeholders on.

(00:08:14):
And when you start figuring out which outcomes are necessary, that is when you move to the leadership and directional areas. The mistake that I see a lot of product managers make is they start operating in either output or outcomes. And when you are transitioning to outcomes, it's very important that you continue to still hone your craft on outputs. For instance, do you just give up on the go-to-market strategy or do you start making product nodes which are then picked up by marketing people and are able to be used to create that go-to-market strategy? You always, always have to have the output and outcome even when you're moving up the so-called career management ladder. So that is very, very critical that as you are producing, even when you are at the senior most levels, don't forget your IC roots, don't forget the IC component. And sometimes it is necessary to just pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things. That also gives you a lot of creds with others in the team as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:20):
So highlighting one insight here is that a lot of advice you hear about how to do well in your career, which you pointed out at the beginning here, is it's not just not immediately drive impact. That's not necessarily what you need to obsess over, which is actually what I recommend to people is just find ways to have impact. So this is really interesting. Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done. Don't so obsess with the impact. Can you talk more about just what, when you say output, what are you describing there? Is it just ship products and be helpful and produce something?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:09:51):
Absolutely. So outputs is shipping products, but it also comes in smaller things. For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way. And one of the product managers actually did that yesterday and I went, wow, it just made my life so much simpler. And not just my life but so many other people's lives so much simpler, and we were able to take that specific output and use it as part of our overall strategy. If that PM would have obsessed about the overall content strategy, overall how we are going to do it versus just how we are going to be sourcing it, they would have indexed on something bigger and maybe would have not even been able to make that impact. But now, they were able to show something which was a small part, which was an output, but it fell into the overall outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:54):
The way I think about what you're describing, which I actually 100% agree with, is when you're starting out in your careers, execution is where you need to deliver. People just want you to get stuff done when you're just starting out. It's not like help us define our strategy and vision for the next three years. We just have stuff we need done. Can you help us get it done? Well, yes. And then essentially the advice is as you get more senior, you'll have more opportunity to think about strategy and what to build versus just how to build it and actually execute on it.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:25):
Absolutely. So focus on outputs at the start of your careers and don't forget outputs even when you grow in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):
So along those lines, just to close the thread on this idea, it's still helpful if you work on something that does have impact that matters, right? How important is that? And you said that you've seen successful product managers work on things that aren't as impactful and still do really well, but I guess would your advice be tried [inaudible 00:11:52] be in a place that is going to drive more impact versus it's not actually that important in the early career?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:58):
So I'll give you my example. In one of my previous roles, there were two product areas that were important for the organization. My product area ended up being the center and focus of the organization, yet the product manager who was chosen to lead the area when it became big wasn't me. It was someone else. At that time, I really felt very bad that okay, why did that happen? But now when I look back, I can see why that happened because that product manager was so much better at the overall craft of output, yet when they were focusing on outcome, we're not forgetting the output as well. So they were just better at me on launching products, they were better at me on working with design, in producing design artwork, and they were definitely better than me in running the experiments as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
I love that. Yeah, basically when you're just starting out, just execute well, execute smoothly, ship things on time. I'm going to say a few things, but I'm curious what else comes to mind here of just what does good output look like? Is it do things that are helpful to your team and manager, ship things on time, bug-free, have a clean road map, everyone's aligned behind, [inaudible 00:13:11] deadlines, things like that. I guess what else along those lines should people be like, "Okay, here's what I should be doing to have good outputs?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:13:16):
Some of the things that I think are useful. So first, what's output? Output is something which is very tangibly defined, which doesn't take too much of your time, effort, and energy to visualize and think and strategize over and you are able to quickly get moving on. Go and ask your product leader, go and ask other leaders on what are the areas they are blocked on. Sometimes they will be blocked on, "Hey, I need to prepare this brief for this particular summit", "I need to prepare this particular slide for a leadership review", "I need to prepare a review, I need to prepare a review which has to be done with the legal." You can volunteer and definitely own and deliver the first drafts of those even if the final draft is not something that you own. That's a simple example of an output, which I feel a lot of people miss because they want to be focusing on the bigger strategic pieces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:16):
It's basically be useful. That's the way I always like to talk about this, just like your job as a PM is be useful, make your team more effective, help your company be more successful. Just find ways to be useful to everyone around you.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:14:27):
Absolutely. And be useful in doing the small things which make an impact and also contribute to your learning versus being useful in areas which you think the mini CEO should be working on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):
Right. There's all this talk about being an empowered product manager, building empowered product teams. I think there's an important nuance. When you're just starting out, you haven't earned the right to inform strategy and vision people. Why would people follow you at this point? We just need to get stuff done, so that comes over time.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:01):
Absolutely. And it's not just when you are starting off or when you are young. Even with if you are senior and you're starting off with a new team, even if you're starting with a new company, you need to have that mindset. And sometimes you will not know the best. And we'll talk more about how to, what is your operating model, which is how you work with others. It's a very, very important thing for you to know that you are one part of the cog wheel, you're not the entire wheel yourself. And a lot of the folklore around product managers can make you confused, especially when you're starting off in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:40):
I love it. Okay, let's keep going. Number two.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:43):
Number two is what you bring to the table. Now, I think how I describe that is what is your impact on impact? So the first access is impact, but you also need to have an impact on impact. And this is what I had missed a lot in my early career, that you put the coolest product areas, your product area is successful and that automatically guarantees your growth. It doesn't. You have to also show that yes, you were a useful contributor to having that particular impact. The simplest thing on this is that is your PRD quality good enough? Are you writing that the draft notes that go and circulate to the care teams, to the marketing teams and so on? Are you making sure that you are deriving from the strategy that has been shaped or you're constantly just pushing back on the strategy? Similarly, you also how you are drafting the north stars, how you are working on the experiments, how you're working on the data, how you're working on the metrics.

(00:16:43):
All these things take time, effort, and energy. And I know there is some literature and there are some operating models where people are working only at strategy levels while all of these execution of these artifacts is being done by some other people. I don't think, especially when you are starting off, that's a very, very good thing. Even when you are mid-senior, I don't think that's a very, very good thing. You have to have to be able to produce these artifacts which are product artifacts. Even if there are people in strategy creating their artifacts, even if design is coming up with a design brief, you need to have a cohesive product strategy or product PRD and work backwards from PRD and product knows yourself. These things are important to show you are progressing on four pillars, which is data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy.

(00:17:41):
Product managers constantly are evaluated on this when you interview, but you also have to demonstrate these on the jobs. And the best way to demonstrate these is through the artifacts, through the notes that you are sending. So you must have that impact to impact through the artifacts that you work on. For a lot of product managers, when I ask, "Hey, I was working on this very impactful area. I'm not able to have the impact on my career, what is missing?" And when I go and ask, "Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc that you have or collaborated on? Can you show me the brief that you sent to the design team on the problems and the ranking of those problems?" Usually, you'll find something or the other missing.

(00:18:31):
In cases that those are bad, you will find that the pre-iteration planning, pre-sprint plannings are not running properly. You will find that the Jira storyboards are very empty and there's just a title in the subject and nothing gets described and so on. So you'll miss all these pieces. So these are the things which you bring to the table and it's very, very important that you work on these aspects as well. Finally, we have what's your operating model, which I feel is the most important thing which you have to have to focus if you are going from mid-senior to senior level. This is essentially about communication, collaboration, organizational skills and community skills.

(00:19:16):
And across product managers, again, because of the folklore of mini CEO and others, I see that a lot of people get carried away in the way they operate as product managers with other stakeholders. There are three tenets that I define in working well as a product manager with others. Number one is raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with. Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself. And finally, you are in charge of getting the decisions made and not making all the decisions yourself. I think as long as you follow these three tenets, you will have a successful relationship across stakeholders. These three tenets are easy to say, but they become very, very hard to embody and display on a day-to-day basis. But this is essentially going to be your struggle no matter at what level of product management you are operating at in your career or within your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:28):
First of all, can you just repeat them? Because I think this is... Essentially, it's like a mantra that PMs can think back to of, "Am I doing these things?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:20:36):
So the three things which are very important for product managers to work with others and other stakeholders are raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with, bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself, and be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
I like this list a lot. It reminds me, there's this product leader I worked with who their team got pushed to do a bunch of stupid stuff. And he realized later that, "Hey, it's actually my job to have pushed back on doing this stuff." He was the head of product for this business unit and he realized, "Oh, I see. That's actually what I should be doing now that I'm in this role." And you sometimes forget that one, you have that influence. And two, that's something you should be doing.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:21:33):
Absolutely, absolutely. It's always within your control and it's always the things that are within your control that you should be controlling rather than focusing on the things that are not within your control and obsessing about those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
I'm so aligned with the way you think about all these things. Coming back to the second actually, just to give people something they can do with this trait. So the way I think about what you described, and correct me if I'm misinterpreting it, is there's a detail-oriented-ness, high quality-ness to the way that you should be crafting all the documents/artifacts you're creating, your one-pagers/PRDs, your roadmaps, your strategy docs, just like they should be really high quality. So along those lines, if you're an ICPM trying to get better at this stuff, how have you found is the best way to level up in these things? Is it working with your manager and getting feedback? Is it peers? What helps somebody get better at the quality and yeah, the quality of these documents?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:22:34):
What you bring to the table is one of the most misunderstood attributes and aspects of product management. On one end, you could get around and say, "Here is my PRD, here is my JIRA board, here are my stories, here is my pre-sprint planning or pre-iteration planning document" and go. It's not just about the spread and the width of the things that you're doing, but it's also about the depth of those things as well. Some product managers, what they bring to the table is arguments, what they bring to the table are debates, what they bring to the table are pushbacks, while others are able to channelize the questions, channelize the inputs, channelize the direction and convert that into strategic choices which can then shape discussions, which can then shape direction. Be the latter and you will rise faster in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):
So you have these three buckets of what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what your operating model is, the three W's. So let try to summarize and see what I missed and then we'll move on. So one is just focus on executing, getting things done that are helpful to your team, your company, your manager, and focus on just getting stuff out. Not so much in necessarily in strategy. Even when you're a manager and a leader and a VP, just like you're still responsible for producing things, not just telling people and being wise. Two, what you bring to the table, my takeaway here is produce high quality artifacts that raise the bar.

(00:24:05):
The way I think about this is as a PM, you want to have this aura of I got this. People put something on your plate, you want to feel like Lenny's got this, I'm not going to have to worry. It's going to be forgotten and I know it's going to be done well. And then the third piece is this idea of an operating model. Basically just make sure decisions are being made. It's not about you that you're pushing back on bad ideas. Is there anything else I missed before we move on?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:24:31):
No. I think the art of pushback is another important factor because if you're pushing back a lot and the way you are pushing back matters a lot as well. Just don't be someone who's seen as an obstacle and a hindrance and as someone who's just very difficult to work with, but rather see as someone who's able to actually add value to whatever your leader, your stakeholders, your product area demands and you are able to advance the product and the direction and execution forward. Once you do that, I think keeping that as the intent and ensuring that your team is getting unblocked and not getting to do work on anything which is stupid or is likely to be changed, then you've really got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:23):
Do you have any advice for how to pushback in a way, the way you describe it is not to be difficult to work with or without seeking importance? I guess is there words or phrases or approaches you found are effective for pushing back against ideas that you disagree with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:25:38):
What I've seen that people who do pushback very successfully and are still considered not difficult to work with, they are also able to bring the tempo of the conversation to a more logical space from an emotional space. I think that's such a useful skill and I sometimes am guilty of operating on a slightly emotional note, which is useful. Sometimes you need a war cry, you need a high pitch, you need execution on war footing. All that is fine, but it's only fine in some cases. In other cases, it's always very important that you're able to bring it down to the logical space so that a logical and a little more equal footing of the discussion can happen. And a lot of this is something that leaders need to ensure is happening, but product managers and product leaders who are working with executives who are able to bring this tempo down and bring it to a little more logical space will also do far better in their careers and they'll also have a lot more rapid career growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
So let's talk about the flip side of rapid career growth, which is career growth that stalls. And I'm curious what you've found most impedes people's career growth. What do PMs do that shoot themselves in the foot and slow their career? Any pitfalls do you find are important to try to watch out for?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:27:15):
I think part of it is on a lot of us in product leadership space. We've not done a very good job in defining rubrics, growth frameworks and so on. But even in places where growth frameworks exist, like three W's, what I've seen is that clean mindset shifts and changes can enable faster growth, but those mindset and changes also can hinder your growth, right? So the first thing is whether you are focusing on things you control or whether you're focusing on things that are beyond your control. Second, what's your relationship with change? And third is how you see yourself. The third is very, very powerful and we'll talk about that as well. The first is what you control. If you drew an access of what you control and what you cannot control, as you're starting your career, most of the work that you're doing is in what you control, right?

(00:28:15):
You are very obsessed with feedback, you're very obsessed with, "Okay, can I do this?" "Can I do this?" "Okay, I'll probably not do this. I'll probably do this", and so on. You're not worrying about the overall corporate strategy, you're not looking at what the competitors are doing, what is their market cap and all those things. You're focused a lot on your craft, you're focused on a lot on your output and you're focused on how you are growing. As you start becoming mid-senior, I see the conversation shifts from what can I do, how am I learning, how am I growing, to why is the organization not doing this for me? Why can that stakeholder not change this thing about themselves? Why do I not get to work on projects like this? Things which start going outside your control. And it is very, very important that you keep your focus no matter what stage of career you get into what you can control.

(00:29:16):
And again, it's easy to say that everything in universe should be in your control. It doesn't happen like that, but a large number of things that impact your career are within your control. And go back to the three W's that we spoke about, what you work on, what you produce or what do you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? And there is tons to do on data, tons to do on technology, tons to do on communication, collaboration, design and research, strategy and community. And you can spend years and years and years crafting those things. Focus on those things, growth will happen at every single stage. The second aspect of it is your relationship with change. Again, when you are younger, when you're starting off, rate of change is crazy. You are growing almost every six months. You are picking up skills and experimentation, you're picking up skills in how to analyze.

(00:30:15):
You're picking up skills in how to work with different kind of stakeholders. And since the rate of change of your skills is high, your rate of growth is also high. Again, as you start becoming mid-senior, I start seeing conversations on, "Okay, maybe I should not do that. Maybe I should not take on this product. I don't know what it means for my career. I don't know what it means for my growth" and so on. So your rate of change slows down. So it's very important that as you get to mid-senior level, you are constantly checking on what you can do to keep increasing your rate of change. And one of the simplest things that you can do is if you think you are four on data, figure out who. And you may be four on data out of five in data. Within your organization, start benchmarking yourself with the best in the industry.

(00:31:13):
You'll automatically see that your scale drops and as your scale drops, you start seeing what you need to improve and do. If you start seeing that on communication and collaboration, you're reaching four out of five within the PMR, start mapping yourself to other stakeholders in other functions. Again, your score will fall in your eyes and you will start figuring out what are the things that you can do as well. So keep your focus on rate of change and rate of growth will automatically take care of itself. Sometimes it also involves changing your team or even changing your company, but those should be the last results. There are significant things that you can do within that as well. One of the final things that I see which limits you, especially as you start growing in your career and you reach mid-senior levels is how you see yourself.

(00:32:04):
I see a lot of product... And I've been guilty of that. When I see that a lot of product managers, that's included me at some stage, doing these things, people will come back and say, "Oh, I am a very high agency PM" or, "I'm a very collaborative PM." Earlier on, I used to think that okay, I need to give this kind of work to these product managers. I need to fit them with these kind of team, these kind of work areas, these kind of opportunities. But then I started understanding these things are not just signaling, they are also anti-signaling. They are like, "Oh, I'm high agency. So it's sometimes okay if I'm little brash, if I cut corners somewhere, if I sometimes come across as a little rude to some people" and so on, right?

(00:32:55):
Similarly, if I'm seen as a hyper-collaborative person, so it's okay if sometimes I'm not very decisive, if I'm not moving fast and so on because I'm this kind of a PM. So it's very important that you check for what are the stories that you're telling yourself because those stories are defining you at a basic level, which is then very hard to correct through frameworks and structures. So figure out what is the story that you are telling yourself. If you are not able to figure that out, talk to the people you trust so that they can tell you that as well, and then correct those stories. And the moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
Wow, there's so much meat and wisdom in what you just shared. I want to go in so many different directions. Maybe just to follow on this last thread, did you go through something like that yourself where you have this sense of yourself that hindered you? Okay, awesome. You're nodding your head, if you're not on YouTube. Can you share that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:33:57):
Yeah. So I'll give an example of when I joined Gojek. The very first thing that I learned in my career was SQL and Oracle. And I was very proud of the fact that my data skills are awesome and I know several frameworks and I know several tools and so on. And when I joined Gojek and I saw one of your guests, Crystal, and I saw the work that she was doing and her team was doing and I just immediately was like, "Yeah, no, this is not... I'm nowhere near", right? And similarly, I also thought that my communication skills are really good and my product strategy skills are very good, but then I worked with people like Dito and people like Sidu who was so good at their craft that it challenged me to see that okay, what is it that I am missing? What is it that I am doing wrong?

(00:34:57):
And it auto-calibrated me in my eyes on where it was, but that also created a hunger in me that this is what I need to fix. And I immediately corrected my assessment of myself that I'm not the strongest product manager on data. I'm not the one who knows all the strategy pieces or even strategy frameworks or how to bring everything to a strategy point of view or communicate it from an effective perspective. And then I started framing I'm still in a learning phase. When I see that I'm not in that phase now, I try and make myself humble by interacting with people who are far smarter than me on different scale or reading different books, or watching podcasts like yourselves. And that keeps you grounded on the fact that okay, you are always learning. And I also found that seeing yourself as someone who's a learner is an enabling story to tell yourself, okay?

(00:35:58):
It may not be the most exciting story, it may not be the most memorable story about yourself, but it is definitely one of the enabling stories as well. Similarly, I think one other thing that I used to say about myself was more that I'm very high agency PM. But as I started working more in Southeast Asia, I learned that mindfulness is also very, very important, that not every team, not every culture will work with you in a very hyper aggressive style. But you still need to get the work done. And I'm still learning on that and therefore, I've started using a word, I don't want to be a high agency person, I want to be a mindful agency person. And so these terms are very important because these are the stories that you keep telling yourself and these also then start shaping your behavior. I do feel that I have a lot to do, I have a lot to learn on these skills, but these things definitely keep you grounded and you keep coming back to the learning phase again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:09):
It's interesting that when you saw Crystal being incredibly good at working with data, you just realized, "Hey, maybe I'm actually not very good at this." And your reaction wasn't, "God damn it, I'm really screwed and this is really depressing me", it's, "No, instead I'm going to try to get better at this." And that reminds me some of the feedback I get with this podcast, those people are like, "Man, these people are so good, I'm never going to be this good. It discourages me from thinking I will ever be super successful in this career." Clearly, you have a different approach. Do you have advice or guidance to folks that are sometimes discouraged seeing people being so incredible and helping them actually continue to level up in this rate of change you talked about versus just like, "Nope, I'm never going to be that good?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:37:54):
I think as product managers it becomes difficult because a lot of your growth is being determined because of feedback of others. And because product management is so ambiguous and still not defined, the stakeholders can also give feedback on variety of dimensions. Some of them may not even be important enough to give feedback on, but they are important enough for them and so therefore, they give you feedback. And therefore, you have to shape that feedback in. But you also have to consider that there are these eight access that we spoke about, the data access, the design and research access, the technology access, the strategy access, communication access, collaboration access, organizational skills access, and the community access. You need to channelize feedback into okay, is this an area that you are targeting for growth or not?

(00:38:51):
And one of the most important things that I learned was that when I joined Gojek or even earlier, there would be so many different areas that I needed to improve on and still need to improve on. You can't improve on every single area. That's what overwhelms you. You need to pick which is the area which is the maximum leverage for you and improve on that particular aspect and then move on to the next area, then move on to the next area and so on. Obviously, if you are floundering in something, if you're really negative in something, then you fix that first because that will give you the highest leverage. But if you are picking up data and design and strategy and technology all at the same time, that's when you'll overwhelm you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:33):
So to summarize the advice there is one, be actually very open to feedback you're getting. It's easy to say that, it's hard to actually listen to people criticizing you and act on it. So I think that's an important takeaway here is just actually, feedback is a gift and actually understand that and try to act on it. I have a great interview with Jules Walter who's a PM at Google now, and he has this awesome quote about how whenever people give him hard feedback, it's like internally he's just melting, but that's externally he's like, "Thank you so much for that feedback, I really appreciate it. It's very valuable."

(00:40:10):
And so that's a good way to get people to keep giving feedback. Okay. And then the other piece of advice you just shared there is pick a focus area. Like say you're getting all this feedback, your strategy isn't amazing, your PRDs aren't great, just find one thing to focus on. And I don't know, do you try to do somewhat quarter? Somewhat year? Do you have a heuristic of how long to spend on one thing?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:40:31):
So different skills take different time and how you are progressing also depends a lot as well. For skills which are softer in nature like communication and collaboration and community, those are skills that you will work on all your life. You'll never achieve anywhere near two or five on five on those ever. There'll always be something that you will miss, there will always be a new context, there'll always be a new set of stakeholders, new company cultures that you have to adapt to. For others, you have to see that what gives you the maximum leverage in your career. When you're starting off, my recommendation is that you pick between data and tech one, and definitely one on design and research and strategy.

(00:41:18):
So usually, that's the combo that I recommend. My advice is if you're coming from design and research background, then you pick data or tech. If you're coming from a data or tech background, then you pick design and research, and that gives you the maximum leverage because that's a skill that you will necessarily not have developed over the years. Once you've demonstrated on two of these three, between data, tech and design and research, then you start focusing on strategy. We've had great success at Gojek in transitioning a lot of product managers, especially in Indonesia, using this framework. And it's produced a lot of good product managers for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
Well, let's actually follow that thread. That's really interesting. And so the approach is you have this access of skillsets and you pick, for this person moving from say customer service to product, here's the two things you need to focus on. Can you talk more about that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:42:15):
Yeah. For instance, we recently had two PMs, one who came from a growth background. This is actually [inaudible 00:42:24]'s team. And one from a research background. And with both of them, we use very different tactics. So we gave one of finding driver redesign, which was very much a very design-focused product, but we still had them leverage their data skills because we were able to create a PRD with incredible amount of data on exactly what different segments of customers we're doing. And that then we worked with designers on what the designs and the framework for that will be. And even now, Lenny, if you will come and see our finding driver redesign next time you are in Asia, it's a piece of art. And if you would see that that was worked on by a product manager who actually came from a growth and data background, that makes it even more special.

(00:43:13):
Similarly, the PM who transitioned from research, I kept giving feedback on technology and data skills are the ones that we need to check. And I need to hear from engineers that yes, they're able to work with her very strongly. And once she was able to do that, she's recently turned a very heated question on one of the features that we were doing into a full-blown solution with designs, with trade-offs and everything, and able to now convert it into a question for leadership on how we should be approaching this particular product and direction. So I think that's proven successful as well. Similarly, there's another person who took risk who was originally from research and again, worked a lot on our products, including our enterprise product. And she's doing an amazing job as well. Again, going through that path of okay, these are the things that you need to leverage.

(00:44:14):
The only watch-out is that it doesn't work out always. In some cases, some PMs will pick these things up fast, and it also makes a big difference if you are transitioning when you are slightly younger in your career. If you are already senior in a function and then you are transitioning, sometimes it can take a lot of time in transitioning and picking up those skills. But it's definitely doable if you get a very strong product leader working with you who's able to shape those skills for you. So it's sometimes okay to go a little slow when you're transitioning so that you're able to go faster later rather than getting faster somewhere and then being stuck there for a while.

(00:46:29):
Something that you mentioned earlier that I wanted to come back to is this confusion about what the PM role is and how that trips people up in being successful in the role and continuing to thrive in the role. You mentioned this to me offline too, that this is just something you deal with a lot, just this frustration of what the hell is this job? What am I actually responsible for? What am I not? What do you find is helpful in helping people work through that, get past that, not make that a big blocker in their career, not knowing exactly what the PM role is?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:46:56):
I think we've been in technology product for several decades now, but we are still figuring out what an exact definition of product management is. And even the strongest definitions are slightly principled and philosophical in nature, they're not very concrete, and that also means that every and different technology companies have gone through different journeys and they've defined the roles very, very differently. And even within a very large company, you will see that different teams, different divisions are approaching the roles very, very differently as well.

(00:47:34):
And on top of that, what that does is that not only internally the product managers are figuring this out, their managers, their leaders are figuring these things out for them, but the other stakeholders who have to work with these product managers are also confused and they don't know what to expect. And the number one question I get from stakeholders is, is a product manager expected to do this? Because they also don't know, okay, is this expected from a product manager or not? And my general answer to that is, if this is something which is blocking the progress on the product, then yes, the product manager should work on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
Love that.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:48:09):
But that works if the product managers have had some training and they have had some training in working with different stakeholders and they have had something on the job. What I've figured out is that there are certain functions and there are certain disciplines which you can't define, but you can only become better at with practice. For instance, what is an actor or what is a dancer? Right? So these are things that you will get better at as you become skilled at it. And earlier, these things used to be looked at as something which is very artistic, only the people who are talented or only specific kind of people can do it. But now, each one of those has become [inaudible 00:48:57] and frameworks as well. So there are courses on filmmaking, there are courses on acting, there are courses on dancing and so on. And similarly, product management is that space as well.

(00:49:08):
So you have to understand there's an art to it and there's a science to it, but you can use the science to figure out the art. So that's the philosophical side of it. The second side of it is what we spoke about earlier that instead of figuring out what is product management, figure out what's your contribution, what's your output and figure out are you contributing on these access on data, on design, on technology and on strategy. And one of my favorite things is that if you created these four circles of strategy, of technology, of design and of data, and you created a product management circle which encircles each one of these, so you are the only discipline, which is the co-collaborator for all of these disciplines and tying all these things out.

(00:49:59):
So it's not about you standing alone, it's you always collaborating and pairing with someone else. But you are the only one who's pairing with everyone else and therefore, you have that unique insight which no one else in the team will have. That role can be played by someone else, it doesn't necessarily need to be called a product manager. But if you are being called a product manager, you figure out the [inaudible 00:50:24] the time piece that you are. And when you are added to the team, you must dream the team's overall contribution, overall energy and overall output up and not down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
I love that. Something I always tell people is the PM doesn't necessarily have the magical skills other team members don't have, it's that they don't also have another job. Engineers may do a great job at being the PM, they just also have to build and code. And they don't have time to do all the things that a PM has to do, and a designer is in the same way, a researcher or data person. And so oftentimes, that's just like there's this person that has the time to do all these glue, work things between teams. And the great PMs also are very good at these skills that help you do these things, but it doesn't mean other people can't do them.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:51:19):
You see yourself as playing a role and not your title and not your function, and that just clarifies a lot of things for people. And different people will play different roles. And depending on the kind of a PM you are, are you in a specific domain or you are slightly generalist, the role that you will be playing in different teams can be different and the variety of roles that you can play makes you a better product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
I love that. You've mentioned these four access attributes of great product managers, overall product managers. Let's just spend a little time here. So you say basically the things you need to be doing and good at, data, design/research technology, strategy, and then you also mentioned collaboration and communication. Maybe you're-

Vikrama Dhiman (00:52:08):
Yeah, organizational skills and community. I think those are very, very important because one of the things and one of the things which one of the product managers works with me continues to say, and I really plus on that a lot, is that product manager is the all community enabler in the team, in the organization. And that community is the software aspect which ties everyone together towards a common mission of delivering an output. And that I think is a very, very important goal in today's context, especially for teams which are becoming more remote or teams where people are not co-located or they're distributed. That community aspect becomes a very, very important part that product managers need to focus on and bring and channelize as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:05):
So let's just quickly describe each of these attributes. I imagine people might be thinking, "Okay, what should I get better at as a PM?" And this is an awesome list. Each company has their own career ladders and attributes and things like that, but not a lot of companies don't. So I think for people that are trying to figure out where do I need to get better, I think this is a really cool list. Can you just maybe just a sentence explanation of each of these attributes and skillsets that a PM needs?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:31):
So each one of those skills, like the most growth ladders, what they will do, is they will have say for data, they will have level one, exhibits these traits. Level two, exhibits this trait. Level three, exhibits this trait. Level four and level five and so on. That's how they'll describe it. But five is absolute ninja level data quality, like you could probably do a data startup of your own.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:55):
Like Crystal basically?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:57):
Crystal. And level zero is someone who cannot even basically define the basic metrics for this particular product and won't be able to figure out is this particular thing impacting orders or users or revenue. And so you'll really not be able to figure even that piece out. Similarly, on design and research, for product managers, we focus a lot more on problems and are you able to identify problems from a user's perspective. That's at level zero. And level five will be somebody who's able to define the user problems but is also able to tie them to business roles as well. So that makes it the holistic. Similarly, on technology, it's one of the skills which is relatively easier to define where you don't have any tech understanding. If somebody asked you what is HTTP or API or internet and you'll be like, "Okay, I don't know what it is."

(00:54:55):
And while on the other end, you are able to have deep debates and could probably write technology design documents yourself as well. I think sometimes people get confused between data science. And in different organizations, I see data science bucketed either in data or in technology. Either is fine as long as you are clear on what your organization's framework is. Similarly then, there is strategy. Strategy is I think another area in product management which gets very confusing because there is obviously corporate strategy, there is business strategy, there's pricing strategy, there's strategy everywhere. Product strategy for me is where you are able to define that while somebody defines that this is the mountain that you're going to climb, but okay, how are you going to climb that mountain is basically the product strategy piece.

(00:55:47):
So you are not in charge of okay, are you focused on growth? Are you focused on revenue? Are you focused on profitability? That's someone's choice. Are you going to pick this country? Are you going to pick that country? But once that is picked, what are the user segments that you're going to focus on? What are the needs of those user segments? How are we going to figure out what the right product for them will be? What is the order in which we are going to work on that? That whole piece of product strategy is with the product managers. And again, in the first case, you are basically going to rely on everyone to tell you, do this, do this, do this. In second and in the level five cases, you are able to articulate a very coherent product strategy at a broad level as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:33):
Amazing, thanks for sharing that. I think for people that are trying to craft career ladder for product managers, this could help inform the way they think about this. By the way, when we mentioned Crystal, for folks that have no idea who we're talking about, she was a early head of growth at Gojek back in the day. She was a previous guest on the podcast. I always forget how to pronounce her last name exactly, but I think it's Widjaja, Crystal Widjaja.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:56:33):
Widjaja.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):
Widjaja? Okay, okay. Great. Going in a different direction, we're going to move to contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you believe that other people wouldn't agree with or generally just don't believe?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:57:12):
I used to think intent is the most important thing, right? And when I was starting off, that used to be the advice that as long as your intent is right, even if some of your words are not landing, even if some of the comms are not landing, that will work out. What I've seen is that it's not enough. Your actions, your behavior, and the way you communicate, the way you collaborate, that also has to communicate and show who you are as well. So intent is not enough. And that's a thing which I think a lot of people in my age group just don't get, but people who are slightly starting off their career, it resonates well with them. Second thing I think where I feel that it's become, I don't know, is it contrarian or it's become politically incorrect, is that you still need to put in the effort and our number of hours is effort.

(00:58:23):
And I think that's one thing which has become very politically incorrect to say over the years when I was younger, it was the norm that yes, you will have to put in the effort, you will have to put in the hours to grow and improve your skills. And it's not even about your growth in the company, it's just your own growth. You have to spend the time, effort, and energy into growing. I think a lot of that is getting lost in the debates between complete workaholism and just being not very serious about your growth at all. So I think those are the two that I find myself having to explain myself again and again and why I feel this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
I completely agree with that. I find a hugely strong correlation between hours you put into the work you do and success. And I think there's been a return to okay, working hard is really important and you shouldn't be afraid of promoting working really hard. So we've actually gone through everything that I wanted to ask you. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to share or is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:59:41):
No, I think it has been great talking to. I hope it was useful to people. I've tried to keep it real, but also in takeaway format. And if there are any questions that you have that I feel I have not answered, I'm happy to answer them.

# Feeling stuck? Here's how to know when it's time to leave your job | Ada Chen Rekhi

## Transcript

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:00:00):
It's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us. Which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard [inaudible 00:00:42] experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ada Chen Rekhi. Ada is an executive coach and also the co-founder of a product called Notejoy. In her coaching practice, she focuses on helping founders scale themselves. Before starting her company, she was senior vice president of marketing at SurveyMonkey. Before that, she started a contact management startup that was acquired by LinkedIn where she ended up leading LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team. Two fun facts about Ada. One, she started her current company with her husband, which we chat about whether that's a good idea or not. Also, her brother is Andrew Chen of a16z fame. In our conversation, it explains how to make better decisions with a framework she calls Curiosity Loops.

(00:01:21):
We do a live exercise around my own personal values. She shares a bunch of advice on how to intentionally and practically build your early career path. How to thrive as a woman in Silicon Valley, when to get a coach and what you can do on your own without one and a ton more. Enjoy this episode with Ada Chen Rekhi after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:40):
This episode is brought to you by Sprig. Next generation product teams like, Robinhood, Notion and Loom rely on Sprig to uncover blind spots in their product development process. Sprig let's product teams collect user insights fast, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. One of the things I love most about Sprig is that they're all about getting product teams the specific insights they need in the timeframe that they need it.

(00:02:07):
As of today's, Sprig is making that even easier with the new and improved templates library. On this podcast, you've heard a lot about how useful templates are for companies as they grow. Sprig partnered with some of the top product teams and product thinkers to build proven playbooks, specifically to solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today from how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow to troubleshooting drop off. Sprig helps you build better products. Sprig now has a library of more than 85 templates that you can use to get started collecting user insights quickly right in your app. I especially love that Sprig builds templates specifically for product teams, and I was really excited when they ask me to create a template around product sense.

(00:02:47):
One of the questions they get most is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to build a playbook along with Sprig on how to do that based on my experience at Airbnb and from what I've learned interviewing top product folks like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to build your product sense. Explore my product sense playbook and the entire Sprig templates library and build better products faster. Check it out today at sprig.com/templates. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/templates. Ada, welcome to the podcast.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:03:20):
Thanks. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:22):
So I've heard such great things about you from a lot of people, including a bunch of guests that have been on the podcast. And you also have this really great event diagram of maybe an ideal guest for the podcast. You've done growth. You've done products. You've started a company. You're also an executive coach to founders. So there's a variety of topics I'm excited to begin too. So thanks again for being here.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:03:22):
Yeah, I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:45):
An interesting thing that I'll start with is that when we were chatting about what to focus on in our conversation, where you're emailing about this, and you did something that I thought was really interesting. You ran something called a Curiosity Loop where you pinged a bunch of your friends and asked them for input in this really structured way. So I thought I'd start there. Could you just share what this process is, so that we can learn how to maybe do it ourselves, this idea of a curiosity loop?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:04:08):
A curiosity loop is essentially going to a whole bunch of people. In this case, I sent out an email very quickly to about 10 or 11 people and asking them, "Hey, here are nine topics for Lenny's Podcast. What are two or three of the topics that resonate with you and why?" And I got back such an incredible amount of information for about 20 minutes of work. I don't normally do this, but I actually showed you some of the anonymized feedback from people really just talking about what resonated and what didn't. So I came out of it just so much smarter, and curiosity loops are my method of doing so.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Often, people ask friends for advice on just like, "Hey, what should I do here? What can I maybe talk about on this podcast?" Your approach had a lot of structure to it. So maybe two questions just like, what is the actual structure to this concept? And then two, just people... You can often ask friends for advice, but you also don't want to over bug them with questions. How do you think about just not over asking everyone questions all the time, but all decisions you want to make? So I guess the question is, when do you use this versus just not?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:05:12):
I think that there are heavyweight and lightweight ways to use this. So the heavyweight way was what I just exemplified by saying, I sent an email and I made a doc. And on the other side, I had all of this really interesting and rich data. The lightweight way to do this is really just make it your ongoing theme of what you're curious about as you interact with people. So maybe it's this thing where every single day as you talk to people, if you have a social topic, you might just bring up the same question over and over again and start looking for are there any differences or surprises in what people are telling you? One of the big reasons why I think curiosity loops are really useful is that it really fights the fact that there's a lot of bad advice out there.

(00:05:54):
And it's not bad because it's not well-intentioned, but it's bad because it's not contextual. So when someone tells you to quit your job and chase your dreams, or they tell you to sit tight and grind through and build some experience before you go off and go start the company that you've always been thinking about starting, which piece of advice do you actually take? Right? A lot of it depends on your situation, what you're considering, what skills and experience you actually have, and curiosity loops actually are this way of really thinking about how do you make your advice contextual. So I'll break it down a bit in terms of how I think about structuring it. So the first piece of a curiosity loop is really just thinking about asking a good question. In the time when I was working at SurveyMonkey in the past, I had this opportunity to spend a lot of time with the survey researchers, and we really talked a lot about what makes a question good.

(00:06:44):
So in this case, a question's good if it's specific, if it solicits rationale, and it's not biased. You don't want to start a question with, here's what I think because people have this tendency to want to please you or to agree with you. So a good example... Well, let me start with a bad example of a question. A bad example of a question is, what should I do with my career next? It's just such a poorly formed question because it's really vague, it's not specific. It puts a lot of cognitive load on other people, and the output that you're going to get from it is probably going to be similarly bad. Garbage in, garbage out. A better example of a question might be something like, "Hey, you know me. I'm a marketer. I've been thinking about doing this webdev thing. So my plan is to quit my job, do a webdev bootcamp and then go find a job elsewhere. Do you think that's a good idea?"

(00:07:45):
There's just so much rich data to actually explore with that. First, are you suited to being a developer? Are webdev boot camps effective? What's the state of the economy in the hiring market right now for junior web developers? And that's an example of maybe a question that's a little bit more specific and gives people something to anchor on. So that's the first piece. The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you. And then after that, you really want to ask the question. And this touches on what you said about how do you make it really lightweight?

(00:08:41):
Ask the question in a way that really gets you a useful constructive answer, but doesn't put too much weight on people. So what I usually like to do is just make it very lightweight. So in your case, I said, "Here are nine topics. Can you pick your top two and tell me why you like them?" Some people went above and beyond and scrolled through and gave me feedback on every single topic. Some of them just said, "Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid." I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer. Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.

(00:09:35):
And then finally, to close the loop, I think a big piece of it is processing that information and then thanking them for it. So a big misconception that people have when they're really getting into this work of asking for advice or input from other people in the community is often that it's really one-sided. I'm asking you for help and you're getting nothing out of it. The reminder that I would have for all of you is that it feels really good to help someone. It feels really good to be heard and give input. And a big piece of that is, if someone comes to you and they said, "You gave me this advice, it changed my life. Maybe it's not at that level, but it really affected my decision and here's how it turned out. Thank you so much." That feels so good, especially if you only spent a few minutes giving them the input that enabled them to make a better decision.

Lenny (00:10:21):
So to summarize, I wrote these pieces down. The concept broadly is if you want advice on a decision you're trying to make, pick some friends and this is... I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:10:55):
I would try to optimize for getting at least three or four responses. It just depends on the nature of the loop. And then you think about what is your response rate. So if you're emailing really busy people that you don't know very well, maybe you would assume that you only get half of people to respond. If you're emailing people really well and it's really lightweight like, yes or no, and here's why, then you might just send out a handful.

Lenny (00:11:22):
Okay, awesome. So it's five to 10 people, broadly sounds like. Oh yeah, you want to make it really quick and easy. So it's like, here's 10 things, which of these two do you think I should focus on? So it's a quick ask as something you recommend, and then just thank them for it after you finish. Is that broadly the approach?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:11:39):
Yep, that's the approach. One thing I want to note is that it's actually really useful for personal things as well. So we framed it in this professional context of, I'm trying to change a job. But one example that I have is when we had our daughter who's now three years old, one of the debates that my partner and I were having was how do we actually set up our estate planning in terms of if, God forbids, something happened to both of us. How should she inherit the state? And my partner was basically saying, "18 years old, she gets everything fully unlocked." I was saying, "Oh, well maybe 25." And we're at this impasse. And we actually just started to tell each other, why don't we, in our day-to-day conversations with folks that we trust in our family, people that we think are smart, that have kids ask people what their perspective is on it.

(00:12:28):
One thing was really telling, no one out of everyone we asked said 18. So that really dragged my partner up. And then the other thing that was really interesting was that we learned a little bit about executive function and the research around it. So executive function, which is your ability to make decisions and plans and be thoughtful peaks at the age of 30, and it's all downhill from there. So bad news for people like me that are older.

Lenny (00:12:54):
And then I'm getting [inaudible 00:12:54] or game over.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:12:55):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:12:55):
Just like I'm-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:12:57):
But if you're thinking about 18, you are so far from your peak. So it dragged us both up in terms of what our set point was to make a decision like that. But we wouldn't have figured that out without a curiosity loop because it's too much work to dig through papers or research or whatever else to try to come to a good decision on it.

Lenny (00:13:14):
So the core lesson here is just, versus just emailing a bunch of people, asking for advice, which I imagine people often do, just what should I do here? Creating a little bit of the structure and even calling it a curiosity loop, I bet, helps people feel like they want to be a part of this and participate and help.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:13:31):
Yeah, definitely. One of the things that I always try to do is I try to explain to people in my ask, here's why I picked you. So for example, I picked you because I really trust you to be a sound source of truthful advice and give me some feedback. So I really value that. Do you mind spending a couple of minutes and just giving me some thoughts on this?

Lenny (00:13:53):
And how often are you pinging people? If you're a friend of Ada, are you getting curiosity looped every week, or how often? What's your rate limit?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:14:02):
I usually reserve it for bigger things. So probably quarterly or anything where I'm having a big debate, and I'm feeling really indecisive.

Lenny (00:14:12):
Awesome. It also makes me think about this idea of a personal board of directors, and this feels like an asynchronous approach to that concept where instead of a call every, I don't know, quarter month with small group, it's asynchronous. Here's an ask I have-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:14:24):
Totally. Yep. I think this is really based off of the marketing concept of customer advisory councils. So when I was working in marketing and product at a startup, one of the things we would always have is a group of our top customers on DM, basically. And if we had really interesting product conflicts, we would actually just go ping a couple of them and ask them, "Hey, we're debating this. Do you mind just giving us your quick thoughts and telling us why?" And then being able to as a marketer come back to the product conversation and say, here is the literal voice of the customer and four or five different verbatims on what people think about this really enabled me as a marketer to have a seat at the table. And the insight and the helpfulness of that was really something I wanted to bring to my personal life as well.

Lenny (00:15:07):
That's really interesting. It's basically user research for your life. User research, you're told don't do what people tell you to do. I guess it's the same thing here, where it's just like, here's advice and then you end up making the decision for your own own life.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:15:19):
Right. Right. Yes. That is the big caveat. Don't do what people tell you to do. Take it as an input and look for the hard feedback. Look for things that you strongly disagree with or are surprises to you. Because to me, I think these loops are more about looking around the corner and seeing if there's anything you missed in terms of the integrity of your decision making process.

Lenny (00:15:43):
Sweet. You said that people told you what we should not talk about. They're like, "Don't cover this." What was in that list?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:15:50):
So I think there were two topics on the list. The first one, it was just how do you onboard and hire and bring people onto the team? And the feedback I got there was like, "There's just so many people who have done this. I'm sure you have some interesting concepts, but I personally wouldn't be that interested in hearing it. And that was really useful to me. And then the other one was actually just about being a woman in Silicon Valley and the experience of that. I actually had someone write, and you probably read this, Lenny, "No. Stay far away from this. There's no winning on this topic."

Lenny (00:16:23):
Oh, my God. Okay, let's touch on that topic rather than, it's going to be great.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:16:28):
Yeah. So let's ignore the advice?

Lenny (00:16:29):
Yeah, let's ignore it. Before we get to that, I wanted to first talk about you. You gave me some homework also ahead of this chat. And the homework was around helping me figure out values and personal values for myself. I did the exercise. So first of all, can you just maybe talk about what this exercise was, and what the goal of it is? And then I'll share what I come up with.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:16:51):
So the homework that I gave you is similar homework that I give to everyone that I work with in coaching, and it's this values exercise. It's this 10 to 15 minute exercise where you're presented with a list of words that might encompass potential values. It's pretty lightweight. You just go down the list, and you pick out all the words that resonate with you, and then we filter them down into groups of values, and then we filter them down into a stack rank and a list. And the output on the end is basically three to five sentences that cover what are the values stack rank that are important to you right now in your personal and professional life? And what I really like is, it's this internal scorecard of what really matters to you in your decision making process as opposed to the external scorecard of status, money, wealth, how other people perceive you, that often we feel really pressured by. So it's this great way to look back and see how well do decisions, or how well do my situations in life align with my values?

Lenny (00:17:53):
Sweet. And what I liked about it is, if someone were to be like, "Hey, come up with your values." I'd be like, "Oh, my God. I'm just sitting here thinking about words and concepts." And it was really helpful because it was basically multiple choice. Here's all the options across tons of categories, just keep picking and then helps you whittle them down. I ended up with six. I feel like that's one too many. Actually, I added a bonus one because it's just one that I really like. But should I read through what I came up with?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:18:18):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Lenny (00:18:19):
So here's what my values, I guess. Choose adventure, stay optimistic, treat others you want to be treated. Classic. Keep getting better, act generously. And added one that my grandma taught me back in the day that has stuck with me, that had nothing to do with this exercise, but I just wanted to have on this list, which is, first do what you need to do, and then do what you want.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:18:44):
I love it. What a great list of values and what stands out to me from that list too, Lenny, is this idea of achievement or status or success. A lot of the things that we talk about publicly, what your LinkedIn feed might look like don't actually show up in your values. And it must reflect in some of the choices that you've made in your life.

Lenny (00:19:04):
Yes, I hope so.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:19:08):
Let me ask you this. Let's try to apply some of the values in real time as an experiment.

Lenny (00:19:14):
Oh, boy.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:19:15):
If you think about a recent decision that you've had to make or a decision that you're facing coming up, can you share what that decision might be? And then let's try to apply the values to it to think about if you were living up to these values, what choice would you make and maybe some of the pressures you might feel to choose otherwise.

Lenny (00:19:37):
So an ongoing decision I have is I have all these opportunities of things I can be doing. Additional things I can be doing. The podcast, this actually was a good example of I never wanted to do a podcast because I really wanted to... Life is good. I was writing this newsletters, doing great, making a living, doing one great email a week. And I was like, "Why would I do anything more? This is good." So I've constantly resisted, I resisted the podcast for two to three years, and then eventually succumbed. And it was a great decision in the end. But now, I have other things that I'm trying to not do, but they're always pushing into my mind space like, a book for example. Of course at one point, and I paused that just so I could have more time for the podcast. So I guess the decision is just like, what should I say yes to versus say no to?

(00:20:26):
I'm looking at my values a little bit, and one of them is choose adventure, which you would think would be just do stuff, just try stuff out. But I feel like maybe it's just a missing bullet point here of, I just want to do less. I'm trying to take on less and do less and cut out and-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:20:44):
That's really interesting.

Lenny (00:20:44):
... simplify. Yeah. Because there's just endless things I could be doing, and I want to spend time with my wife. And now, my new child is coming in a couple of months, if all goes well. So that's where my mind goes when you ask that.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:20:57):
Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe if you were to decompose adventure, what adventure actually means to you and you go into that word list, you might actually just find that some of these opportunities like writing a book, at some point, it doesn't feel like an adventure.

Lenny (00:21:13):
Right. That's so true. The beginning of it is an adventure. And then that's such a good point because yeah, once you start a thing... Something I always say about this content creation life is like, it's easy to start. It's hard to keep it going, and it becomes just this treadmill of just, you have to keep creating awesome stuff basically for the rest of your life. I don't know how you get off the treadmill. Not that I'm complaining, but that's just a reality of this path. So that is such a good point that it becomes not adventurous very quickly. So that's really interesting.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:21:13):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:42):
I guess the other thing is just, what's a cutoff? What am I... I do a bunch of angel investing and so I'm thinking about just stopping that for a while just so I get up more time with my new child and just carve out things that maybe aren't as essential.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:21:55):
So on the values exercise, I think what you've done a really good job of is just really delineating, here are some examples of choices that you have to make. I think that there are some points in our lives where writing a book, it just seems really obvious. It's good for your career. It's the next level in terms of where you go from the community, the newsletter, the podcast and getting to that next level. But where I think there is value is these lists of values can help ground us from those obvious decisions. So in my life, to share a mini example of this, there have been a lot of cases where the next obvious step for me might be to go an executive at a big company and to go chase the dream and continue on the latter climb of my career.

(00:22:40):
As I've examined my own personal values, a big piece of it has really been around prioritizing relationships and really pursuing knowledge and growth on my own terms. And things like independence and autonomy have started to creep up over time, especially once I started a family. It became very clear to me that sometimes the external scorecard of what people think you should go do is very much an opposition of what I actually want to do. Even though it might be objectively better, depending on what scorecard you actually use, I would actually be less happy with some of those outcomes. So I think values are this really nice useful tool to think about how do you make better decisions again to maximize for your own alignment with life.

Lenny (00:23:23):
That's such an important point. It connects back to the course that I taught and then this potential book of, it just feels like an obvious thing I should do. It was great, but it just didn't bring me joy. And other things bring me more joy. So it was a really good reminder of just like, do I really want to be doing this, or is this just a thing that feels like a smart thing to do but maybe isn't for me psychologically? So I love just the reminder of coming back to values as a lens to decide if you want to do a thing versus just, what are people telling you? Smart or... Which just feels like the natural thing to do.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:00):
Yeah, and it's really self-aware of you too. I think too. Cut it off because you start realizing that you're doing this course, and it's not giving you energy or it's not quite the right thing. It's really hard to say no to things.

Lenny (00:24:12):
It is. It is.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:12):
And I don't think we focus on that enough.

Lenny (00:24:14):
Yeah, I've learned how to do that better. I have all these auto templates of ways to say no in different ways. Actually, ChatGPT, somebody's tweeted this that it has all kinds of good suggestions. If you could ask it, how do I say no to my manager who wants me to prioritize a feature? And has all kinds of clever words to [inaudible 00:24:30].

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:30):
Oh. Yeah, that's a great use for it.

Lenny (00:24:32):
The other thing that I realized as we were going through this exercise that I imagine you find also is when you come up with an initial set of values, I was realizing I maybe another value of just keeping things simple, simplifying. And I imagine that's part of the process of narrowing in on what's important to you is you take this first pass and then you try to use it in making a decision and then you realize, oh, there's this other thing that's really important to me and that updates your values.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:57):
Yeah, I think you could definitely use that process to force yourself to make a stack ring and to be really clear, and also change it. Change it. It's yours. So change it over time as it suits you.

Lenny (00:25:08):
All right. It feels like there should be a curiosity loop AI bot with your values that you email, what should I do with this decision? And then it's like, oh, you think simplicity is great? You should not do this.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:25:20):
The next big idea.

Lenny (00:25:22):
There we go. Somebody build that. Okay, so it's funny we went into reverse interview, and then I have to asking questions again. So let's do this. You talked about your career and how you resisted these shiny object opportunities to focus on the thing that you were excited about and wanted to do. So maybe a couple questions there. One is just early career advice. You coach a lot of founders. You had a really in incredible career doing all kinds of interesting things. What have you learned about what works best for optimizing in your early career?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:25:55):
My early career was pretty wild. So I had a really fast run. Over the course of seven years, I went from my first job, which was basically this entry level sales job at Microsoft, working on Microsoft adCenter to SVP of marketing at SurveyMonkey, leading a global team. And when I reflect back on what works across my early career, it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit, which actually sounds dark now that I'm saying it out loud, but-

Lenny (00:26:27):
Yeah, sounds great. I love it.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:26:29):
Explore and exploit, if you're familiar with it from growth background, is really just around what mode you're in. You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it, how well it works, whether or not it fits for you. Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more. And when I think about explore and exploit for early career, it's all about exploration. You really haven't experienced that much, but you're doing it with a thesis. You're doing it with that growth mindset where you have a hypothesis. So coming out of school, my first job was at Microsoft. I was at adCenter. The big thing I learned from the 367 days that I was there was that corporate life at that point in my career was just a little bit too slow-paced for me, and I was really hungry to go do something else.

(00:27:19):
But I also learned quite a lot about marketing and advertising. And I had the suspicion that not only did I want to try something smaller, but I also wanted to try marketing. So I moved to this series a startup where I had to sample my desk on the first day called Mochi Media. And I was in a marketing role at a startup and had this great run there over three years, where I learned all kinds of things and even tried product at some point. What I learned from that experience was then I love marketing, games was pretty fun and being in a smaller team was really dynamic. It was this choice on, do I exploit and go deeper into the industry or do I explore more? I was 23 at the time, so I decided I have so little to lose, let me continue exploring. My big thesis was, let me try being a founder. So then I founded Connected, and Connected was this personal CRM that's a little bit like Clay.

(00:28:14):
If you've seen Clay now recently, in terms of how do you do a better job of managing and building your professional and personal network and-

Lenny (00:28:20):
Yeah. It's a beautiful product.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:28:22):
Yeah, it's a beautiful product, much more beautiful than what we built at the time. It was such a great learning experience to discover what it was like to be a founder of a company and an entrepreneur. My personal learning out of all of those things was really just that I was continuously optimizing that I loved marketing. I loved being a founder. I really like small teams. There are pros and cons to this corporate life, where maybe things are really slow paced, but the scale is really important. So that was really what carried me through a lot of my early career. After Connected was acquired by LinkedIn, I moved into this exploit mode.

(00:28:59):
So I was at LinkedIn for a period of time while I was investing, and I really wanted to be intentional about the time that I spent there in terms of how I wanted to exploit it. So unlike a traditional path where you're really focused on trying to get the biggest title, a big team, set yourself up to run a big org, my role at LinkedIn was really explicit. I even told my manager this when I first came in, "I'm here to learn to be a better founder." So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it. So if I can make my LinkedIn experiences match to that, that would be a huge win for me independent of promotion, or compensation or a whole bunch of those things because the plan afterward is actually to go off and start another company.

(00:29:53):
So I managed to get into this great role leading gross marketing for LinkedIn, working with their growth team from a hundred million to 200 million members, read every experiment brief that I could, spent a lot of time with the team, really understanding their process, and then shifted into the subscription side where I worked on LinkedIn subscriptions and ran their sales subscriptions business at scale through the online channel. And saw how all of those pieces and worked together from a financial planning and analysis stage to all of the optimizations that they did. It was just such a rare opportunity, but I wouldn't have gotten those opportunities if I just let them promote me or I followed a strategy where I was just focused on trying to get the biggest title.

(00:30:35):
Instead, I was focused on those learnings and those experiences. Ultimately, the fact that I was a startup founder. I had big company experience. I had growth experience, and I had subs experience. And I was a product marketer. That was actually the winning combination that caused SurveyMonkey to send me a LinkedIn InMail, start a conversation and ultimately bring me in as their head of marketing at the age of, I think I was 27 or 28 at the time. Because their rationale was, you have all these experiences that we really need and you don't have the management experience, but we have plenty of that. We're happy to teach that to you.

Lenny (00:31:10):
I really like this framework. I've never heard it described this way. Explore and exploit connects a lot with what I always recommend which, early on, is to optimize for a variety of experience so that you can figure out where you actually have a good time and what you're interested in versus getting stuck on the first thing something. I don't know if you'll have an immediate answer to this, but I'm curious. Many people don't know how long to stick with something that maybe doesn't feel good but may lead to something. Like, someone may be in a job right now, or just like, "I really don't like this job, but I feel like it'll lead to something great. And I don't want to give up too quickly." So I guess the question is, what are heuristics that tell you to stick it out and stick with something that you think will lead to something great versus hold the recording and get out?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:32:01):
That's a great question, and it's a really tough one that is contextual on the person that you are. So one of the things that I like to share is this idea of, it's a little gory, don't be the frog. So if you are familiar with the story of the frog, it's this idea of boiling the frog. So if you take a frog, and you throw in a pot of boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you take a frog and you put in a pot and you increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive. And how I apply this to your question to come back and circle back to it is that, it's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them or we think, "Gosh, it'll get better. The next manager will get better. I'm always one conversation or one promotion away from getting to that next step."

(00:33:02):
But you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending. That's what makes the advice really contextual. I really look at it from the lens of learning. What can I learn here, and how am I growing and developing? So there might be an argument for you to stay at a job for two decades. If it turns out that every single day you're being really challenged, you're learning new things, you're deriving a lot of meaningful enjoyment out of your work and you're this happy frog that's hanging out, realizing that things are good and the temperature is not rising. But there are also situations where you might encounter just some really hard walls, where you don't get along with the thesis of the company. You don't agree with the direction of the company that you're in.

(00:33:53):
There are fundamental aspects of the role which are limiting to you or you're not learning a lot, frankly. I think that happens a lot, where you providing a lot of value and doing a good job at a company, but you might not be learning things that stretch you and grow you to achieve your ultimate goal. When you are aware of that learning, I think that's the point at which you have to say, "How do I change that? How do I be an agent in my own career and make a difference in that?" And it doesn't necessarily mean that the strategy is to quit your job and do something catastrophic, and then go do something else, take a course or sign up for something new. It might actually mean a proactive conversation with your manager or the leadership to say, "I love what I'm doing here, and I would also like to learn a little bit more. And here's what I'm interested in."

(00:34:44):
And then try to find a way to either land the right projects. So in my case, it was really growth and subscriptions, that experience that I really wanted. Let's say, you hit a blank wall there, even take it as a gift of time, which is great. I'm not going to be able to get this from my company, but now that I have this extra time because I'm so optimized at this job, how am I going to choose to use that time? And it might be around building relationships with some of the key people at the company or learning something new on your own time that you can leverage in another way.

Lenny (00:35:17):
I like that. Make the most of the time, even if it's not the best opportunity for you. Also love the frog boiling metaphor.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:35:23):
Little gory.

Lenny (00:35:24):
No, it's great. So I guess the lesson there is think about are you that frog being boiled right now and think ahead, is this going to be the end of the-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:35:24):
Right. Keep an eye on your environment and which way is it trending?

Lenny (00:35:35):
Yeah, the temperature on the thermostat in your office. The other thing this makes me think about is, it's so easy to get caught up in making your resume look amazing and continuing to just like, "Oh, if I get this next role, my resume's going to look so great." And this other logo and this cool title and role. I find that just like, you do that long enough in your life, you end up... You retire, and then you die. Life is that resume. Right? That is your life, you're living, and there's not going to be a point at which you have to realize, okay, I've done all the things to make my resume. Also, I'm like, "What do I actually want to do? Am I enjoying this?" Because it'll never end. You're never going to end trying to make a better resume and a more awesome background for yourself. Do you experience that with yourself or other people you work with of just over optimizing to make an awesome series of roles and logos and then forgetting, do I actually enjoy any of this? What am I doing?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:36:31):
I have experienced that personally a lot. I think that it may be a generational thing or it just may be my background, but having grown up with the Asian tiger parenting, it's very focused on logos or certain accomplishments or certain achievements like, going to an Ivy League school, working in a company that someone's heard of, being able to have a certain title. At a certain point, I bailed out a bit and I really started to think about who am I trying to please and optimize for? That values exercise that I had you do, Lenny, is actually a big piece of that. So I probably took it for the first time over a decade ago, at this point. I looked at those values and I said, "Well, if I draw a straight line from where I am right now and just extend it forward and play the rest of the movie as it plays out, given the current plot line, how well does that optimize for those values?"

(00:37:27):
That's great. My parents might be happy about my resume or other people might look upon me in a certain way because I've managed these achievements, but in my day-to-day life, what really matters to me, what's really meaningful to me, only some of this stuff really matters. So getting very intentional about that and being clear about who your audience is as you navigate your career. I think it's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us, which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.

Lenny (00:38:25):
I love this topic. Thank you for sharing that. This episode is brought to you by Sprig. You already heard me talk about how Sprig helps you uncover blind spots in your product development process, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. Just this week, they launched their brand new templates library, which you can find at sprig.com/templates. Which helps you plug and play proven playbooks for helping you identify and solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today. From how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow, to troubleshooting drop off. One of the questions I get most on this podcast and in my newsletter is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to work with Sprig to build a playbook for how to do just that, based on my experience at Airbnb and what I learned from interviewing top product people like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to develop your product sense, which informed this template that you'll find. Just go to sprig.com/templates to find this playbook and 85 more that is sprig.com/templates. S-P-R-I-G.com/plates.

(00:39:31):
What triggered your reevaluation of that path? Was there just like a, "Oh, man. I need to really rethink where I'm going." And then I have a follow-up question.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:39:40):
Really just a career opportunity. And it was this step where I could do something that was, at the time, really high profile and really exciting and felt great, but also involved demanding travel and grueling hours. And wasn't in a space that I was excited about, but it looked amazing on my resume. And I was talking to a friend about it, and they actually introduced me to this values exercise to say like, "Ada, go through and fill out this values exercise, and apply it to this job." What I realized at the time, after I did it, was that my top three values, the things that I cared about this job would categorically just fail at because I would be gone all the time, in pursuit of glory that I didn't really care about. Instead, my current path at the time was something that if I persisted in, it would actually be able to potentially fulfill all of those values.

Lenny (00:40:36):
It reminds me of a friend who has this metaphor of this ego monster sitting in the corner of the room that's always yelling at them, when they're... To do the thing that's impressive and take on the really cool role, and just get an awesome title, and do something really impressive, that's just like yelling at them from the corner. And my friend's just learned to just like, "Okay, that's the ego monster pulling at me. I don't have to listen to that. Doesn't mean I'm going to be happy if I listen to this guy." And that's been really helpful to my friend just to disassociate that part of the brain.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:41:10):
Yeah. The ego monster is a great way to put it. I use something that Warren Buffet has talked about, which is inner scorecard versus outer scorecard.

Lenny (00:41:19):
Tell me more.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:41:20):
So he talks about how there's an outer scorecard, which is how the rest of the world evaluates you, how you keep score in terms of external factors. So top 10 lists, wealth status, title, maybe things that people really care about. And then your inner scorecard is things that actually matter to you, how you spent your day, how good of a person you are. Did you have an adventure today, Lenny? Were you kind? And there are a lot of things that maybe are in opposition to each other. So really thinking about did you win at the cost of kindness? Did you succeed at the cost of losing access to the adventure that you really wanted? I think really thinking about it in that lens helps you trade off against some of that external pressure and the ego monster.

# When to invest in new acquisition channels | Adam Grenier (Uber, MasterClass)

## Transcript

Adam Grenier (00:00:00):
One of the biggest pieces of advice I'm giving to people that are like, "How should we adjust our marketing with the economic changes and things like that?" I was like, "Start by assuming you no longer have product market fit, because you had product market fit in a different market." It's a different market now, so you have to start over. And hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things, and you could be right back on track. But if you just assume you need to launch a new channel to fix this problem, you're going to be wrong, because your entire customer base changed, not just the next 10% of customers that you're looking for.

Lenny (00:00:34):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Adam Grenier. Adam was head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber where he basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team from the ground up. Then he went on to VP of Product and Marketing at Lambda School, and most recently he was VP of Marketing at Masterclass. These days, Adam advises companies, large and small, on growth and marketing strategy.

Lenny (00:01:10):
In our conversation, we cover how to decide when to try new and emerging acquisition channels like TikTok, VR, newsletter ads, and how to go about testing them out. We get into the growth CMO role, which is an emerging role that Adam has helped pioneer, and we get into some real talk about burnout and depression and mental health issues that often come with working in tech. This was a really powerful and insightful conversation and I learned a lot from Adam both as an operator and as a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. And so with that, I bring you Adam Grenier.

Lenny (00:01:48):

Adam, welcome to the podcast.

Adam Grenier (00:04:04):
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:06):
It's my pleasure. I'm really excited to chat. So, I'm going to give a very brief overview of your very impressive career, and just let me know if I missed anything.

Adam Grenier (00:04:15):
All right.

Lenny (00:04:15):
Sound good?

Adam Grenier (00:04:15):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:04:17):
Okay, so you were most recently VP of Marketing at Masterclass, which I'm actually a happy subscriber of and I've watched many a video. Before that, you were VP of Product and Marketing at Lambda School. I don't know if that's right before, but that was something you did. Also, you were head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber, which is a really cool title. And I think you spent four years there and you basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team. And currently you're doing a bunch of advising and exploring to see what you want to do next. Is that about right?

Adam Grenier (00:04:50):
Yeah, you hit most of the key points. I think pre-Uber, the first chunk of my career was on the advertising side, so worked in agency world. So, I kind of think of this as phase three of my life. Ads world was phase one, startup and growth world phase two, and now really just spending time helping entrepreneurs and founders and built companies and that type of stuff.

Lenny (00:05:16):
What's been your favorite phase so far?

Adam Grenier (00:05:18):
I mean all of them. I just embrace what gets thrown at me and allow it to organically happen. So, each phase has had its pros and cons and ups and downs, and so I think they've all fit pretty well into where I was in my career.

Lenny (00:05:34):
Speaking of moving and adjusting and iterating, I know you're big into improv. How serious are you about improv?

Adam Grenier (00:05:44):
Good question. Serious in the sense that I've done it for a very long time and I still do it and I try to do it regularly. Serious as in am I aiming to make money off of it and have a career out of it? Unfortunately not. There was a point in my life that that is what I wanted to do. I lived in Chicago, did Second City ImprovOlympic, a variety of different places, did quite a bit of performing, but also got into corporate paychecks early as well.

Adam Grenier (00:06:12):
And so kind of built a lifestyle that made doing improv full time probably not the best path for me at the time. And so made a pretty conscious choice early on that it was more of a hobby and if something ever came of it, cool, but if not, that's okay. It's something I keep coming back to, because it's very grounding and fulfilling in ways that work and family life and things like that don't quite hit for me.

Lenny (00:06:34):
Actually at Airbnb we had an improv teacher come and work with the PM team. It was for months. We did improv games once a week.

Adam Grenier (00:06:42):
Nice.

Lenny (00:06:43):
And played all these fun things. And I'm curious what you've taken away from improv that has helped you become better at your work?

Adam Grenier (00:06:51):
So, I think generally the whole suite of skills that you develop in improv are pretty applicable, right? Because you are getting comfortable on your feet with change, with teamwork, building off of each other, experimenting, trying new things, a little bit of everything. I think a couple of the key rules or themes of improv that I really try to hammer home with people are obviously the "Yes, and..." side of improv, which everyone's probably heard, which is in a scene the worst thing you could do is deny somebody, because you're actually just stopping progress and you're not building off of anything.

Adam Grenier (00:07:27):
So, the appropriate approach is to say, "Yes, that is true, and..." and add to it. So, if someone's like, "Hey, you have a chicken on your head," not saying, "No, I don't." Just kind of ruins that scene. Versus saying, "Yes, I do, and it's name is Sally. What's your chicken's name?" Builds on that and gives it more opportunity. And so I think that in growth in business is super important to be able to say, "Yes, I do see your idea," or "Yes, we did accomplish this and this is what we want to do next and this is how it's going to build on it," I think is super important.

Adam Grenier (00:07:59):
The other one that I think is less known or talked about is the gift of details. So, in a scene, if you give somebody really specific details about something, it gives so much more meat to be able to work off of in terms of what's coming next. So, if someone's starting a scene and they're clearly watching television and clicking through the channels and I walk up and just say like, "Oh, you're watching TV, cool." That's a yes statement. I'm not denying what they did. But if I come up and say like, "Oh cool, you're watching TV. Is that an Alf episode? I haven't seen Alf since I was a kid. It reminds me this one time I actually ate my own cat."

Adam Grenier (00:08:39):
Just giving those specific details of Alf and me as a kid and I had a cat, which if people don't know Alf, he ate cats.

Lenny (00:08:48):
I don't remember that. I remember Alf, but I don't remember he ate cats.

Adam Grenier (00:08:51):
He was always trying to get the family cat. So, those kinds of details add a ton of value and you take that into the business world, to use Masterclass for instance, if I say, "Yeah, Masterclass, we've got this way to build content that is both entertainment and education," that's interesting. But if I say, "We create content that is both education and entertainment to solve people's deep curiosities in the way that maybe a biography would." That just opens up the exact problem that you're trying to solve. What are other alternatives to that problem? How are people consuming that? So, I think the gift of details in good improv and learning those skills is something that I really value and look for in every aspect of my business life as well.

Lenny (00:09:41):
It sounds like it's really helpful, one, in marketing, creativity and positioning, and things like that you just described. Have you found it also to be helpful in collaboration like this "Yes, and..." piece? I'm curious, is there an example or story where you like "Yes, and..." someone? Do you actually say "Yes, and..." in a meeting? How do you actually find that you use it?

Adam Grenier (00:09:58):
I hear it every now and then. I don't usually literally say it. I think one of the areas that I've found it to be valuable is when you've got cross-functional work. So, obviously at Uber we dealt with city teams a lot, and so a lot of the times the way that the central team would scope a problem versus a local team would scope a problem, would almost feel at odds with each other. And if you approach it with that "Yes, and...", it's often still true.

Adam Grenier (00:10:24):
It's like, oh, both of these things can be true at once. You could have a different goal than I have, or you have a system problem local to you that is important to you and it's not important to me. That's okay, both things can exist. So, now that we accept both and can work off of each other, we're more likely to build both a better rapport and energy among ourselves because we're not just saying, "No, no, no, no, you're wrong. That's not true, that's not important to the business. Why are you doing that?" That type of energy when cross-functional work, it just kills the scene, it kills that progress. And then you don't build relationships, you don't build the right solutions, all that type of stuff.

Lenny (00:11:06):
It sounds really good. Everyone in theory wants to be really good at this. And I imagine just doing a bunch of improv is a really good way to get better at not getting defensive and being like, "Yes. And how do we make this idea better?" Is there something you can advise folks to work on this skill, or is it just do a bunch of improv classes and it'll kind of help build that skill?

Adam Grenier (00:11:25):
That's one. I would say that I'll say that all the time to people, "Do some improv classes." And I get a lot of people like, "No, I'm not funny," or, "I don't want to do improv." And I think it's still a really great class to take, even if you have zero interest in doing improv, or public speaking, or any of that kind of stuff. Because, again, improv 101 is taught everywhere. Every city has it somewhere, and it's rarely ever people that are trying to do improv professionally. It's all games, like you said. The classes that you all did at Airbnb is what improv 101 is, right?

Adam Grenier (00:12:00):
It's just like, "Hey, let's just have fun. Let's just get out of our skin," and things like that. So, I do think everybody should take improv classes. I think it's also something with a lot of goals or skills that you want to develop, I think being really public and open about you wanting to develop that. So, if you are managing a team and you want to sharpen the skills, make it a team goal, or have accountability and just say, "Hey guys, I know that I've been pushing back on things lately. I want to really try to embrace and grow off of ideas better, hold me accountable, call me out and be like, 'Adam, "Yes, and..." this please."

Adam Grenier (00:12:32):
Or giving people permission to push back on that when it doesn't happen, I think also just opens the door for more productive conversations with people and the ability to hold yourself accountable and keep trying it.

Lenny (00:12:47):
I love that. And such a good team bonding activity. There's like all these reasons to do this as a team. My wife actually, she's a designer, artist, writer, illustrator kind of person, and she's been taking a lot of these sorts of classes to help inspire her creativity. She never wants to be an improv person, she did stand up classes.

Adam Grenier (00:13:03):
That's awesome.

Lenny (00:13:05):
As you said, it just helps you get the juices flowing along these lines. Okay, so we're not going to talk about improv the whole time.

Adam Grenier (00:13:13):
We could if you want to.

Lenny (00:13:15):
We could. Throw me word, let's go. No, we don't want to do that. So, there's basically three things I really wanted to chat about with you. One is how to decide when to invest in an emerging acquisition channel like TikTok, VR, Clubhouse was a big thing. You have some really interesting thoughts on how to decide and approach this thing. To the growth CMR role, which is kind of this, I think emerging role, something you're really good at, and I just want to get your thoughts on what's happening there. And then, three, some real talk on burnout and depression that often comes with working in tech and stuff that we go through. Does that sound good?

Adam Grenier (00:13:51):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:13:51):
Okay, great. So, to start with in the first topic, if you think about it just every company essentially goes through this kind of S-curve of growth. They start slow, they find something that's working, then hopefully it works out and things start to grow, grow, grow, and then eventually it flattens out and you see this S-curve that happens. And every company is always trying to find the next S-curve to add this layer on the cake that keeps overall growth up while this first growth channel slows.

Lenny (00:14:18):
And so people are always looking for what's the next thing? "Oh man, Clubhouse is coming out. We should get on Clubhouse." "Oh, TikTok is so hot, we've got to run some TikTok ads." And there's always something new, like newsletter ads, I don't know, podcast ads, if that's new. And you have a really interesting framework for how to think about this and make decisions and experiment. So, I'd love to hear insights there.

Adam Grenier (00:14:38):
So, the exploring emerging channels framework that I'll take, either my teams or companies that I'm advising through, has three core ingredients that I like to spend time with. So, the first is really understanding if there is an overlap between what the customers need is, what your company's goals are, and what the channel actually does really well. So, the example I've used in the past is Spotify in the moment of things like Clubhouse and Paparazzi and stuff like that becoming really popular.

Adam Grenier (00:15:14):
Well, for Spotify, they're trying to get more people to consume music and be entertained by music and things like that. And it's all audio driven. And so their growth goals are probably around new customers or deeper engagement with audio. The customer's needs are discovery and more ways to maybe have deeper relationships with their music. If you're a jazz fan, can you learn new jazz artists or more about the artists that you love? Things like that. And then take those two channels. If you take something like Clubhouse, it's audio first, it's almost like live podcast radio type feel to it.

Adam Grenier (00:15:57):
You can get into these rooms with just people with really amazing esoteric knowledge about something. And so its strengths have a really clean overlap to me with the goals of Spotify, the needs of the customer and the strengths of that. And so that to me is great. That is probably a green light in terms of is it even worth our time? Versus Paparazzi is very photo driven and nothing really to do with music or anything like that. And so it's like even though Paparazzi might have become the best biggest channel ever, is that the thing you should be putting your time into? It would be a yellow light for me at best.

Lenny (00:16:36):
And how did you describe that again? It's the medium matches?

Adam Grenier (00:16:40):
Yeah, the strengths of the medium. So, let's take influencer right now. Actually two of the channels that a lot of people are talking about right now are streaming TV or OTT and influencer marketing. And so to me, one of the strengths of influencer marketing is hyper targeted contextual marketing. And so I can go find the five influencers that are hardcore Alf fans, and if I'm marketing Alf something, great, I can go find that specific thing. Whereas OTTs a lot harder to get that specific.

Adam Grenier (00:17:16):
OTT strength is broad reach and video storytelling and that type of stuff. So, it's like, okay, well maybe my medium is if I'm Masterclass and I have a ton of video content and storytelling and things like that, that channel actually makes a ton of sense probably. So, it's like what are the strengths of that channel is something that... that is actually probably the piece I see people ignore the most, which is they just want to know if a channel is hot or not. And this gets especially hairy in this world of a lot of B2B doing more consumer-esque marketing. There's so many B2B companies that just don't apply to emerging consumer channels.

Adam Grenier (00:18:00):
And it's just like, please just stop. I don't need a Notion Clubhouse channel this week. And maybe there's a world to do that. But I think that's kind of number one, is making sure that there's even a reason that you should be there to put it on your radar right now.

Lenny (00:18:19):
Awesome. What does the OTT stand for by the way?

Adam Grenier (00:18:22):
Oh my gosh, you're putting it on the spot.

Lenny (00:18:24):
It's all good.

Adam Grenier (00:18:25):
I'm drawing a blank on it.

Lenny (00:18:26):
But essentially it's a streaming platform?

Adam Grenier (00:18:28):
Over the top. Over the top. So, instead of it being cable TV, it's coming from a box. So, it's primarily if you think of ads on Amazon or Hulu or even if you go to cnn.com and you start streaming and you get an ad first. it's basically video ads, but a lot of them now are happening on televisions and on streaming services rather than just on websites.

Lenny (00:18:55):
Got it. Okay, cool. So, the first is the strength of the channel. You should look at that.

Adam Grenier (00:18:59):
Yep. And how that overlaps with your customer and your business needs. The second is the channel DNA. And so this is looking at things like where are they in their trajectory? So, Clubhouse is actually a perfect example, because in a weird way, so Clubhouse got hot before Facebook got cold. And I was pretty amazed how many more people were trying to crack Clubhouse than TikTok, because TikTok hadn't really released their ads solution yet, but neither had Clubhouse. But everybody was talking about Clubhouse, and TikTok is very clearly not going away anytime soon, where Clubhouse hopefully won't. Like this is an amazing product.

Adam Grenier (00:19:41):
I really enjoyed it and loved it, but it was clearly very early, very quickly at that point of hotness where everyone was just kind of, "That's the reason I should be there." And part of this reason is to accept the risks of going into that channel. So, if I go and dedicate two quarters of work to Clubhouse, I need to accept that they are so early in this curve that there's a good chance this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it'll be over. It's not a repeatable action. It also is important because if you get something to work on a channel that's earlier in their growth curve, the likelihood that they will change is very high.

Adam Grenier (00:20:23):
You're going to need to commit a lot of cycles to keep it going, because it's like, "Okay, well, their product is going to evolve drastically very quickly over the next two years." And so a really great example is Facebook early... I was at Zoosk. And so Zoozk and companies like Zynga got tons of their early growth because of notifications on Facebook, which was one of their early features, which allowed basically anybody that took any action on Zynga, it would post on everybody else's page that you got 10 carrots, and that was a huge growth lever.

Adam Grenier (00:20:59):
But then Facebook just pulled the plug on that. And so it's like, well, if you put all of your energy into that and that's it, it was pretty clear that that was still an area that's like this may not last forever. The last thing on the channel DNA that I like to look at that's a little bit more, I don't know if odd or unusual is the right term, is I like to spend a lot of time thinking about how they monetize. What is the monetization strategy of the channel? And the reason is because if you, as a business, can match or support their monetization strategy, it actually gives you a really interesting leg up with that channel.

Adam Grenier (00:21:37):
Because the likelihood of you being able to call them up and go do custom stuff with them, or partner with them, or that your solutions will actually stick around for a while, it'd go up pretty drastically. And so my key example of this was with when Facebook started exploring mobile ads, Hotel Tonight, we were one of the alpha testers of mobile ads, because I'd been sitting here buying ad inventory on networks for the last five or six years and just waiting for Facebook to work, because it just wasn't really working for mobile installs.

Adam Grenier (00:22:13):
And it's like, I know this is a huge channel because I can use it on my online marketing, my web marketing, but as a mobile acquisition it's nowhere near as efficient as a lot of these other networks. And so as soon as they were doing that, I was able to basically position and say, "Look it, you want to work with us. Let me into your alpha, because I have five years of experience already buying mobile ads. I know the space. I know it'll work. And if you get us to work, we're a killer case study, because we are a non-game and a lot of money is spent on gaming, but there's these whole other major categories that you're going to need other than gaming examples within that group. So, you're going to be able to use me as a case study and a lot of different scenarios than the gaming players."

Adam Grenier (00:22:59):
And so I was spending a lot less than the gaming players, but because of that understanding that your goal at Facebook is to make ads work for all of travel and for all of leisure and those kinds of things, that's the value of working with me. So, that's another piece of the channel DNA I like people to focus on.

Lenny (00:23:18):
Awesome. That's such a good one, because to your point, if your goals are aligned, they're going to be like, "Yes, let's make this happen." And it always feels like it's this behemoth that doesn't want to talk to any new startups, but if you can make the case of this is going to help you and the way you laid out is so clear, it's such a good idea.

Adam Grenier (00:23:35):
And especially with emerging channels, right? Because their whole thing is that make this work for a long time. It's part of the challenge you see with some new channels flipping to the other side of growing an ads business, will gravitate towards like, "I want to get Disney on here," but Disney is very campaign driven, or they have been traditionally, where it's like you may get one big paycheck from them, but that doesn't... The way that UA driven gaming works is you get that to work, that's a gift that keeps on giving forever, right? Because there's not one of those companies, there's thousands of them and they all do the same thing. So, being able to drive that conversation is really helpful.

Lenny (00:24:18):
Cool.

Adam Grenier (00:24:18):
And then the third main ingredient is just your own company DNA. And so I think risk profile is a big one. Do you actually have comfort in being a first mover, a true first mover? Nobody knows anything, tracking's not going to work, it's not going to be programmatic. You're probably going to show up on content that's offensive. You're probably going to ask for refunds that won't happen. It's going to be really painful to be a true first mover. Do you have that appetite? Do you have the staff to actually be able to put someone on that and it not distract from everything else?

Adam Grenier (00:24:53):
And then the other piece on the company side is just your current channel mix. There's very few companies that I recommend saying, "Yes, go put energy on this brand new channel that you don't know how to scale yet before you've figured out some type of volume on Google and Facebook." Every now and then there may be a perfect fit where it's like, absolutely, you should be the person doing this. But if you're not at least getting something out of the basic channels that everybody else is using, it's probably not the thing you should be putting your first energy into. It should be like, "Great, I've got a good foundation." Like you said, now we're at that stage of trying to add things, tends to be a better stage to do more risky exploration into new channels.

Lenny (00:25:40):
What advice do you have or can you give to founders teams that are trying to test one of these in terms of just how to run these tests? How much time should they spend, would you say? What do they look for? I know that this is a hard question and super dependent on the situation, but any advice there?

Adam Grenier (00:25:55):
So, I think going through those three ingredients should help shape that answer, right? Because if you're like, "Okay, well, the first one is super strong, the channel DNA is maybe really early and I've got a small to mid-size team and maybe only one channel working," then it may be like, "Great. Put half of one person into this, because it's maybe interesting. But don't put any more than that into it." Versus if it's like, "Man, this is a killer fit the channel's a little further along and I have a 20 person team, so I'm going to put three dedicated people to this, because we are in prime position to be the leaders in this new channel and really push it."

Adam Grenier (00:26:36):
So, I think it's figuring those pieces out, because it is a very it depends answer, but rarely ever is it like, "Hey, this should be your entire team's focus for the next three sprints or five sprints." I think that if you've got that half person working on it for a while and there starts to be some magic happening, sure, put a sprint or two against it as a whole team. But generally speaking, I think keeping it minimum at first is my typical recommendation.

Lenny (00:27:06):
I had another guest, Yuri, who I think from former Grammarly, and he made a really good point that it's often better not to try something than to do it badly and then take away the wrong lessons. I guess, in your experience, what's a timeframe you think people should put into this stuff? You said two sprints, maybe a couple weeks. I don't know, what's the range of just maybe don't spend more than X months on something new if it's not clearly working, just based on your experience.

Adam Grenier (00:27:33):
Generally I wouldn't let anything bleed past a quarter. You can probably get some good signal in a month or less, what I would call fishing. It wouldn't be like you're just putting bait in the water to figure out where the fish are, not necessarily getting statistically significant repeatable solutions. The big variables that can change that timing, so if I'm exploring a new video channel, the content I need to create is if I'm going to have to create something that takes three weeks to produce and $20,000 to make, I may want to give it a little more time, because I gave it more of an upfront investment.

Adam Grenier (00:28:16):
Versus if it's like I want to put text ads in podcasts listings or something like that. It's like, great, I can do that by myself at midnight and it's not distracting anybody or anything. And if it doesn't work in three weeks, let's move on. But generally ideally what you're working through, and we'll touch a little bit more on this with the Growth CMO, is that this should all be part of a roadmap. It shouldn't just be randomly chosen and thrown at. This should be part of your sprint process and you should have a backlog of other things that you want to try. And so you're actually weighing that decision of how long based on what other opportunities you're missing out on by investing in that.

Adam Grenier (00:28:57):
But I would say most channels, especially new ones, are going to take more than a couple cycles to kind of suss out. Because there's no rules, there's no playbooks yet on how to do them well. So, give it a little bit of time, but if you're going over a quarter and you don't feel like directionally it's getting better or it's interesting, I would put it back on ice for a while.

Lenny (00:29:18):
Cool. And to your point, you're not going to see any statistically significant answers. Is the thing you look for just like you know it when you see it? Oh wow, qualitatively feels like it's working kind of thing? Is that what you kind of look for?

Adam Grenier (00:29:30):
Yeah, and I think define that going into it. What am I looking for, for this? So, something like Clubhouse I'm probably not going to see clicks. It's more about are we able to start a room and increase the size of that room by 10% every time that we run it? Okay great, that means that we're at least getting better at this and there's more reach available to us. But if we're getting 20 people every time we start a room and then it goes down to 15, then we're either not doing this well, the channel's not doing well, or there's just not enough reach for us to actually expand. Versus TikTok you might be able to say, "Great, I can actually track clicks and conversion, so let's look at it the way we would any other channel."

Lenny (00:30:11):
Got it. So, kind of look for momentum and that you're getting better and that it's moving somewhere. Awesome.

Adam Grenier (00:30:16):
Yeah. Yep.

Lenny (00:30:17):
Cool. So, a question that I'm sure is on many people's minds that they would want to ask is, Adam, what are emerging platforms that are interesting right now that we should experiment with? What do you feel?

Adam Grenier (00:30:28):
So, I mean I mentioned OTT, or basically the key thing with OTT is that it's way more trackable than traditional television, but it has similar value that traditional TV does in terms of the ability to do more long form storytelling type content, and a lot of it's not skippable if you buy it. And so those are reasons to be exploring that right now. It's hard for me to call that emerging channel, because it's been around forever. It's there's more of it and the tools and services around it are way better now than they were four years ago. And so I think the sophistication and ability to scale OTT is much higher now than ever before. Influencers probably the one that I'm most intrigued by, because similar to OTT, the scale and services and the ability to go do it is still there.

Adam Grenier (00:31:19):
It's also got that hyper granularity that when I get into influencer tools, it feels to me like early Facebook when I used to go be able to target Lenny, or 10 people that have exactly the same likes as Lenny. And that type of stuff where it's like you can get so specific and find exactly who you need. It's incredibly tedious and manual and it's a lot of relationship management. So, I'm also keeping an eye on the technology being built around influencer, because I think that's a huge area of opportunity for entrepreneurs right now.

Adam Grenier (00:31:57):
But generally speaking, the scope and opportunity there is huge and it's not going away, but it feels very new and different right now. And it supplements the ability to do some hyper level targeting that you've not been able to do, that Facebook and Google are getting less open about at the same time. I think VR is really interesting in the way that mobile was interesting before iPhone Three, where it was if you've got a VR app, it's a really interesting space, but if you don't, it's not that interesting to me yet. Any that have come up for you that you're like... what are your thoughts on this?

Lenny (00:32:35):
No, these are great. All I think of is TikTok.

Adam Grenier (00:32:38):
I feel like TikTok's crossed a chasm, whereas they actually have a formalized ad platform now, people are finding scale. There's still a ton to do there and influencers is also weird, because it crosses all of these other worlds as well. But I think TikTok is actually hyper interesting and everyone should be doing that. But I think of that less as you should be doing it as should I do it, should I not? And it's more I need to figure out how to do Facebook if I'm at least mildly appropriately should be there.

Adam Grenier (00:33:05):
The podcast ads I think are great. I think that I bought podcast ads 15 years ago, so it doesn't feel like an emerging channel to me. I think there's way more volume now than there's ever been before. One of the guys that was on my team at Uber has a company that's doing programmatic buying and that type of stuff. And so I think there's more opportunities on podcast. I think people want to treat it like Facebook ads or direct response ads, immediate response ads. And actually what I keep seeing as the effective strategy with podcast ads is treating them more like radio where it's more about getting on the right program, making it personal and feel like it should be part of that program, and then repeating over and over and over again.

Adam Grenier (00:33:53):
So, I think podcast is super interesting. I think it's just hard to scale. It's likely not going to get people the same volumes as the Googles and Facebooks of the world.

Lenny (00:34:01):
Cue our mid-roll ad. I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from Podcast sponsor, Amplitude. Hey John.

John Cutler (00:34:08):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (00:34:10):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (00:34:21):
Well, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So, the big aha was seen how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach and send data to other destinations. Experiment and CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (00:34:42):
And supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (00:34:46):
Yeah. So, Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.

Lenny (00:34:55):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started.

Adam Grenier (00:35:01):
I also come from a very consumer perspective. I'm actually stronger on B2B companies using podcasting, because it has that exact same value I just described, but each one of their customers is substantially more valuable. So, they don't need the scale that a consumer application or product would need.

Lenny (00:35:20):
Yep. That's exactly who I work with usually. One last question on this topic. What percentage of the time do you find that an emerging channel works? Is it like 20% of the time, 10%, 5%? What should people estimate, it's probably not going to work but when it does it's going to be game changing?

Adam Grenier (00:35:34):
Like 5% of the time. There's new things popping up all the time. I think the area that I think of as emerging that I've found more success in is taking things that exist already and make them... so the two slices of it are either it's existed for a long... like podcasting. So, it existed for a long time and now we're finally getting to a spot where it feels scalable. The other is existing channels that introduce something brand new.

Adam Grenier (00:36:04):
So, at the mobile ads I described on Facebook, pre mobile install ads and post. Those first 18 months of mobile install felt like an emerging channel, right? Because they were changing the product every week and tracking didn't work, and there were all these funky problems with it even though Facebook had been around forever. But brand spanking new channels, I don't know, they rarely work or are worth the effort early that you hope that they will be.

# Thinking like a gardener, slime mold, the adjacent possible: Product advice from Alex Komoroske

## Transcript

Alex Komoroske (00:00:00):
So much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like I have a plan. I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen. And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. What I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. If you do this properly, it looks like magic. I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get, including products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Today, my guest is Alex Komoroske. Alex is one of the most original, articulate, and first principle thinkers on the future of product and tech that I've ever come across. This conversation will get your brain buzzing in all kinds of ways. Alex spent 13 years at Google where he worked on Search, DoubleClick. He led Chrome's Open Web Platform team for eight years, led augmented reality within Google Maps, and developed a new toolkit to align company-wide strategy from the bottom up. After a stint at Stripe as head of corporate strategy, he's currently founding a startup that aims to reimagine the web for the AI era.

(00:01:13):
In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover how LLMs and gen AI will impact how we build product in the coming years, what skills will matter most as AI becomes a bigger part of our lives, what companies can learn from slime mold, organizational kayfabe, the adjacent possible, strategy salons, why you should be thinking more like a gardener than a builder, plus a bunch of productivity tips, life advice, and so much more. This was such a fun episode, and I'm sure this is going to get your mind thinking in completely new ways.

(00:01:57):
Alex, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Alex Komoroske (00:02:01):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):
I love the way your brain works. My brain immediately starts buzzing anytime I start reading some of your stuff. And one of the more interesting things that you write and do and a really interesting habit you have is you actually have this doc that you keep called Bits and Bobs that I love, and we're going to be touching on a lot of the things that you share in this doc, Bits and Bobs, and we'll link to it. First of all, can you just explain this doc, Bits and Bobs, what's it about?

Alex Komoroske (00:02:27):
Yeah. I think it's like 600 pages now. It's this one Google Doc. Every so often, almost every day, someone will accidentally add a suggestion like add a space or something because it takes so long to load that while they're waiting, they'll tap on the screen and then it'll turn into taps on adding a comment or something. And I take a lot of notes. And people, I tell people when I'm in meetings with them of like, "If you see me on my phone or typing, that means I think you said something very interesting and I'm writing it down. It's not that I'm just that I'm disengaged. I try to collect all these ideas." And then once a week, I go through, I take a few hours and I just reflect to myself and try to find patterns and unpack and find meaning and things. And I write those down and I started sometime in the past sharing those publicly, and it's now become a thing I literally can't stop doing.

(00:03:17):
I just find someone who was like, "Oh, if you get more exposure for this, if you broke these up into tweets that you sent out once throughout the day," it's like, I did this for me. I'm happy to let other people see and peek into my weird mental process if they want, but this is 100% about my own self-reflection. And it's not designed. I don't want anyone to feel compelled to read it or... In fact, it's designed a little bit to be, I allow myself to be a little bit illegible. I want people to have to work a little bit with it. And it's not going to lay it out on a platter. It's going to jump between different things. I'll use terminology sometimes that is, what are you talking about? And I do that specifically. I don't want anyone to read and be like, "Oh, it sucks. It wasn't worth my time." It's like, "Cool." It's a 600-page Google Doc of my just unspooled insights. It's okay for you to not want to dive into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:09):

Alex Komoroske (00:06:21):
I started it many years ago in the same conceptual thing, taking a bunch of notes. I have a thing called The Compendium, which is an open source tool. If you look at it currently, it looks like I haven't touched it in years, but that's actually incorrect. I built this about five years ago. I use it every day. And so I have, I think let's see, I currently have 17,248 unpublished working notes. And so what I do during the week is I'm taking notes very quickly in meetings, and then every day or two, I go through and I process them and put them in as working notes in The Compendium, and this is where I correct misspellings. I add just a little bit more context so that it will make sense to me if I were to read it in a year.

(00:06:58):
And also, I built a feature into it that uses embeddings to find similar cards. I find similar ideas from the past. And then what I do on Friday afternoons is I sit down and I go through all the notes I added that week and I just click and check the ones that still resonate with me, they still seem interesting in some way. And then I have a little export thing. I put it into a Google Doc, and while the kids are napping on the weekends, I just go through them and try to distill them a little bit more in a more long-term format. And then on Monday mornings, I publish them. And again, it's a deep... For me, it's like I can't imagine not doing this. It is the place where I find most of my most interesting insights is by reflecting on interesting conversations from the week before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:39):
As we get into the conversation, people get to see how deeply you think about stuff. Part of the reason you're able to think so deeply about stuff is you have this practice where you take time to reflect and share and crystallize. There's so much power in just forcing yourself to write it out, I imagine versus, just not.

Alex Komoroske (00:07:54):
100%. I find that when you're busy, you're constantly just go, go, go, go. There's no time to do any deep thinking. Deep thinking takes time and space, and you got to create that space. The mundane, pointless bullshit will take every square inch you give it. So you got to make that space to sit back and reflect and luxuriate in these ideas. And when you do, you're often like, "Oh my God. Oh wow, that's one I'll keep."

(00:08:18):
And I told people, back at the very beginning of my career, I used to work from home on Fridays. And people gave me so much shit for this and they'd say, "Oh, you're working from home on Fridays." First of all, I will line up my output any day of the week. I'm very proud of the impact I've had. Second of all, Monday through Thursday, I'm in meetings from 8:00 to 6:00 or whatever. I'm just running between. I'm singing, pinging people and scheduling things and flinging action items. And the one day I don't take meetings is on Friday, and that's the day I read documents carefully that people had sent me or reflect. And I think to myself, what is the thing that if I had done it before the week started would've saved me tons of time and effort that week?

(00:08:58):
So for example, maybe in 10 different one-on-ones with people on the team, I had to explain to them a strategic thing that we were doing or a change that we were making. And the idea and the way I framed it worked for everybody. Well, you know what? That should probably be a document, right? If the same idea worked for 10 different people and now in the future there's probably 10 other people that need to hear it, and now I'll write that document in 30 minutes and now I have it as a memorialized thing that other people can read on their own time without having to involve me.

(00:09:24):
And you also find these interesting ideas sometimes where you look at this problem that you're banging your head against, you go, "Oh wait, if I will like that, that would've a wildly different dynamic." And you can only find those when you take a step back. And I find that people, I told someone, I mentored someone, I've mentored hundreds of PMs over the years and I told someone that at one point and they go, "Oh, I wish I had the time." And it's like, you got to make the time. All of us are busy and we will always be busy. And so this to me is not something I do to just for the enjoyment of all. I do deeply enjoy it intrinsically. It's something I do because I think it makes me more productive and effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
I'm very tempted to go down a whole direction of just how you structure your time and your productivity calendar and all this stuff, but I'm not going to do that. That could be another episode if I do.

Alex Komoroske (00:10:09):
I do for that for hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):
What I want to do instead is pick on some of the Bits and Bobs that you've been focusing on noodling on that I think are going to be really helpful to listeners in how they think about product and the future of AI and all these things that I think are emerging. And the first one is actually that I want to get your thoughts on how AI and LLMs are likely to impact product development. A lot of the listeners of this podcast are PMs, engineers, founders, people building software, and you're spending a lot of time thinking about AI and product development. A lot of your Bits and Bobs have been just like, "Here's what's happening. Holy shit. This is how things are going to be." So let me just ask you this how do you anticipate LLMs and gen AI are going to change how products are built in the next three to five years?

Alex Komoroske (00:10:56):
I think they change a lot. I think LLMs are truly a disruptive technology. In fact, I would argue that what we're seeing in the industry is us trying to use mature playbooks from the end stage of the last tech era in one that doesn't really fit yet. To me, LLMs are magical duct tape. They're formed principally by the distilled intuition of all of society into a thing that operates between, a cost structure between human and plain old computing. So much of how the industry is built presupposes the idea that software is expensive to write and cheap to run, and LLMs undermine both of these. So it makes it LLMs allow writing shitty software to be significantly cheaper, not necessarily good software, but good enough in certain contexts. And also it means that there's certain software now that isn't plain old computing that can be run cheaply. It's relatively expensive marginal cost.

(00:11:49):
And so if you're going to do a consumer startup, it can't be based on advertising. It's just too expensive. Advertising cannot clear the inference costs even with inference costs declining. So I think the way to me, a disruptive technology changes tons of stuff, all these assumptions you didn't even realize you were making because you didn't realize it could be any different.

(00:12:07):
Imagine if you were locked in a room for your entire career, no windows, and you have all these experiences. You're going all this know how. You're getting this sense of how things work, what will happen. And then imagine that room tilts on its axis by five degrees. Everything looks roughly the same, and yet now the dynamics of the force of gravity is pulling in a different direction than it was before. You didn't even think about the force of gravity before because it was so omnipresent. It never changed that it's just a blank in your head. And now gravity has changed effectively for your perspective and all kinds of intuition is now wrong. I put this thing on the table, it's going to stay there, and then it slides off and falls into the wall. All kinds of weird stuff will happen.

(00:12:44):
And I think LLMs to me feel like that. I can't tell you the number of people who are... At some point at a year or two, someone came to me, they're like, "I just built a prototype, product that would've taken me three months. And I can believe it's going to start up." I was like, "How differentiated do you think that is?" Everybody can do that now. It changes the basis of competition. I think today I see a lot of folks using LLMs, and LLMs are like a squishy computer. We're used to computers doing exactly what we told them to do, which is not necessarily what we meant. And only some people have learned the skill of programming, the arcane magical incantations to make computers do exactly what you meant.

(00:13:24):
Now, LLMs can do all kinds of stuff. And they don't do exactly what you told them, but they do typically do roughly what you meant. I see all these places where people will build products and they'll say 80% of the time, 90% percent of the time, it's great. 5% of the time it punches the user in the face and they're like, "Oh, we're going to reduce the number of times it punches us in the face." It's like even if you get it down to 99% of the time, it's fine. If it punches in the face, that's not a viable product. And so how do you design your products assuming that this thing will be squishy and not fully accurate and fully work?

(00:13:53):
People use these things a lot as oracles. "I'm going to have it. I'm going to formulate the answer and it's going to be a fully fledged answer." And of course, strawberry has been really stabbed at. Gotten a chance to play with it. They are getting better at some of these kinds of behaviors at great expense. But in a lot of cases, I instead would rather say, "How can you take LLMs for granted? How can you assume that you now have this magical duct tape? Don't assume it's going to solve all your problems. Don't assume it's going to do autonomously be able to give high quality results of every case. But what can you now build now that you have magical duct tape?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:24):
You're a product manager for most of your career. Now, you're a founder. I'm curious what your advice would be to product managers and people building products in terms of what skills they should lean into, what you think is going to be matter most. There's hard skills. There's soft skills. There's getting more technical. There's getting more product business-oriented. Just what do you think people should work on more and becomes more valuable and what do you think becomes less valuable from a product builder perspective?

Alex Komoroske (00:14:52):
I think in this early stage, we're in the community gardening phase, not the factory farming phase of this technology. And so I think what people need most is curiosity and play. You should be playing with these things and trying out different things and seeing what weird things are possible now. One of my favorite things, to be honest, right now, it's using AI is WebSim. WebSim is so weird. What a weird idea, like why? And then you play with it and you realize, "Oh, this is a thing that could only exist in a world where LLMs exist." And I think these kinds of odd, interesting, weird, provocative, generative things will be where a lot of the interesting patterns are found because right now we're so used to... If the playbook, if the cost structures have changed, the kinds of things are now possible, the playbook is wrong and we should throw it out or at least ignore it to some degree. So it will feel like we are navigating through a whole new industry that it has in the past.

(00:15:47):
Anytime that an industry gets really, really, really, really, really good at like vertical SaaS, we know how to execute the crap out of that. We know exactly what to do. It doesn't require that much. It requires consumption and execution velocity and all this. But vertical SaaS, I think, is not the right model of how you would attack a problem that is an AI native style problem. And I think that those are where all the interesting things will be. And again, I think a lot of the tactics that we're trying out at the beginning, they won't work. It'll turn out that they only work 95% of the time, and 5% of the time they punch you in the face or something. And that means that you have to be more adaptable and you have to assume that a scrappy thing will be more important.

(00:16:28):
One of the ways I put this is we've seen a vast reduction in the cost of distribution of information, and now we're seeing a reduction in the cost of information production. And most of it is slop. And so in this cacophony, how do you stand out? You stand out by having good taste. I think taste is the most important thing. You have a perspective that is different from the background noise, different from the average and that people find compelling. How do you find your own taste and how do you lean into that taste is, I think, much more important than just generically executing in the way that everybody else could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):
There's so many threads I want to follow here, but maybe on just this last one, when you say taste, what do you mean by that? What should people think when they're like, "Okay, I got to work in my taste"?

Alex Komoroske (00:17:09):
Taste, one way of looking at this is differentiate from what the LLM would've written if given the same prompt. How different, how distinctive is what you have to say. And I think so much in large industry, in large organizations is about fitting into the role. How can you be a better and more efficient cog in that particular kind of machine? And I think in this new world, what you want to do is how can I become the best version of myself? How can I lean into the things that I have an interesting perspective on that make me different? Those are the kinds of things. And now of course, if you lean into something and you're doing something out there and nobody resonates with it, then it doesn't count. Good taste is something that is individual and also compelling to others. And so find what things you say that resonate with other people and lean into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
I love that. Back to the WebSim example, we're going to link to this, but definitely play with WebSim. I was interviewing Dylan Field at Figma Config and this was his... Asked him like, "What's the number one thing you think people are going to get more excited about in the future that you're playing with now?" Because he's really good at identifying things that are going to be bigger in the future, and that was his choice. And it's very hard to understand exactly what it is if you just go there. But basically it's like you type a URL and it invents what that website is using just AI LLMs.

Alex Komoroske (00:18:22):
That's insane, as in. And you can get it to do, you realize as you play with it more, you can get it to do all kinds of specific things and you can steer it based on the way it uses the context of the last few pages. It creates a coherent world that's coherent with the things that you have recently seen, because you can steer it directly and you can watch fascinating people. They'll cover all kinds of wacky little techniques to get to generate, like generate a game for your kid that's on a specific type. You can do all kinds of stuff. And I'm not saying necessarily WebSim to me is a disruptive thing. Things that look alien and weird and yet are compelling, those are what we should be paying more attention to as opposed to take an existing playbook and slap something on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
I love that. Another point that I saw you make about AI and the way it's different from other things we've done is most of the tools that we adopt in the workplace are collaborative where it helps your team be better, helps you collaborate better, and AI is the opposite. It makes you individually better. Can you talk about that insight?

Alex Komoroske (00:19:18):
100%. I think this is one of the reasons is that the question right now of, okay, everyone's talking about AI and yet nobody's doing... There's no interesting breakout success obviously other than OpenAI and Anthropic obviously. So is there any value being created? I think it's entirely possible. And Ethan Malik who's a good friend, who has an amazing blog who's absolutely worth reading, has pointed out, too, that this is a thing that make individuals better in a way they might not want to tell their manager about. I can now do my job twice as fast. And if the organization sees that, they might go, "Wait a second. We should pay you half this much." They're like, "What if we get rid of some extra people or something?"

(00:19:56):
And so if this stuff is magical duct tape, it's very hard to make scaled, repeatable, large scale things out of it. It's very easy to do rig the shit out of anything. And so you'll see it being used in the small in a way that's almost entirely below the level of awareness of the seeing at the organization. The organization almost won't see it or sense it, and yet it could be adding significant value or just being used quite heavily. And I think this is one of the things that makes it if everything is happening in the long tail of usage, then you could conclude, "Oh, it's not being used for anything in the industry," but it's being used all over the place. I talked to Claude 20 times a day. I just have long conversations with it. I have tons of projects loaded up with all kinds of contexts on different topics, and I literally could not do the job I do now without having a conversation partner like Claude.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:48):
Let me follow that thread real quick because a lot of people are like, "Okay," people keep telling me, "Play with AI. Use ChatGPT." Sometimes it's hard to see exactly what they can do with it. Can you give one example of how you found it really helpful or how you use Claude or another tool in your day-to-day?

Alex Komoroske (00:21:02):
I use it to think through problems. And so like when I'm trying to name a concept or get a handle on a few different ways of looking at something, just saying, "Here's what's in my brain about this topic right now. Here's some relevant context." I have a number of projects that just stuff as much of the Bits and Bobs into the context as I can, which is very helpful. And I just say, "Just play with it. Just give me 10 examples of that thing," or then, "Critique these ones," or, "It feels like this one's the best one for me. What works about this? Why is this one the best?" Or, "I want to work at an angle now that has something about know Helen Nissenbaum's concept of contextual integrity. How would I layer that in?" It's just think of it as having a extremely well-read but slightly naive friend who is will never make you feel dumb and is willing to engage you in any particular topic you want to go down.

(00:21:49):
So when you talk to an expert like a lawyer or a doctor or something, you know that that time is extremely valuable. You have a very small slice of time, and so there's tons of questions you don't even bother to ask. "That's a dumb question. I'm not going to spend $1,000 to answer that question." Whereas if you can have that conversation, now this is not saying use it for legal advice, but it can allow you to explore through a problem domain and then later check it with experts and say, "I believe this is a coherent outcome or a thing that should happen." And they can go, "Oh yeah, that works." So I use LLMs to help me. It's like getting a, it's like an electric bike for idea spaces. You can just cover so much more ground so much more quickly in them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:26):
I love that metaphor because it builds on Steve Jobs's that computers are a bicycle for the mind. And that's really a beautiful way of thinking about it, that LLMs are like the electric bicycle for the mind.

Alex Komoroske (00:22:37):
I don't think if that's someone else's, the...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):
Oh, okay.

Alex Komoroske (00:22:39):
I don't know where it came from. Part of my job is a collector of ideas, and so I try to put myself in the most interesting information streams with interesting people that I've found to have taste, have a perspective on something. Maybe I disagree with it, but they definitely have a coherent idea. And then I just allow myself to like, "Oh, that's a really good idea and let me build on that or let me..." I don't even know where that particular one came, but I'm 95% sure that somebody else said that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):
I want to get to this idea of gardening versus building that is central to a lot of the way you think about it. But before we get there, I want to touch on another bit and bob that I love that you come back to occasionally, which is this idea of organizational kayfabe. Talk about what this idea of kayfabe is on its own and then how this applies to organizations in your experience.

Alex Komoroske (00:23:26):
One thing I should flag before I dive into any this stuff, sometimes when people hear me talk about how organizations work and systems, they think I'm being cynical. And I want to be very clear, I'm hyper-optimistic and I also believe that one of the moral precepts is how do you maximize the agency of real humans as ends in and of themselves? And so sometimes when I get excited about this, people go, "Wow, that is so cynical." No, I'm just trying to describe the system as it actually exists. Once we know how it exists, we can figure out how to make it do great things and how we as members of this system can tweak and nudge it.

(00:23:56):
So I just want to flag that before I dive into this. I have this slime mold deck which has gotten a ton of traction over the years, and part of the reason for that is because it feels like people tell me it feels like they think they're crazy and it feels like giving a big hug saying, "You are not crazy. Here's why this thing shows up." And once you acknowledge it, it feels like a bummer to acknowledge it, but once you do, now there's all kinds of options that pop up. "Oh, given that this thing is way more expensive than it looks, I can now do this instead. That one's 10 times cheaper. These two options, this one is way cheaper, way more likely to succeed." So once you see these forces, you see them more clearly.

(00:24:28):
So kayfabe is I think a lens that's useful to understand how organizations actually work. Kayfabe is a word that comes, I believe is a carny word that is used and applied to professional wrestling and it means a thing that everybody knows is fake and yet everybody acts like is real. And I think it's one of the defining forces within an organization, any organization. So kayfabe in the small is optimism, enthusiasm. When someone says, "We're going to do this thing," you say, "Yeah, we're going to do that," even if I think this isn't going to work. If you say, "I don't think this think is going to work," everyone loses hope and it definitely doesn't work. So having a little bit of this is extremely valuable. It's the lubricant that allows organizations to believe they can do something and to attempt to do it.

(00:25:09):
The problem that you get is as organizations get larger, imagine you are five levels down or something and you have this project you're working on and you're trying to give a status update to be rolled up to leadership. And it's currently a yellow, and your manager asks it and you know it's not going to be presented to leadership and enrolled up until next week. "It's yellow, but I've got my arms around the problem. I know how to fix it. I'm going to go talk to Sarah. I think we have a solution. By the time this is reported up the chain, it's going to be green." So if I make it yellow, there's a non-trivial chance that someone's going to swoop down and say, "Well, what's going on? We have a review," and it will be way harder to fix, so I'm just going to... A little white lie.

(00:25:46):
This is a totally reasonable thing to do. It's a self-defensive thing to do. And it's probably the right thing for the organization too. The problem is this happens up multiple layers and it compounds. So then your layer above you does the same, and the same, and the same, and levels up you can be many orders of magnitude off of the ground truth. And so the kayfabe, the thing that everyone pretends to believe is true, is obviously incorrect. And the dangerous part about this is it can lead you to make very bad decisions. And if you as someone who sees this can see that wait a second, the official strategy is definitely not going to work, you're like, "I got to tell somebody. We're doing work that's going in a bad direction. It's not going to work." And you go and say, "I think that it's actually not going to work for these reasons."

(00:26:27):
And what someone will say to you, this happens by the way, I'm not substituting any particular organization, this happens literally in all organizations to some degree, is the senior person will say, "Alex, I agree with you. It's not perfect, but if you hit the ground truth button, if you share that and everybody, the whole thing will shatter and we can't do anything. And so help me fix it. Don't say the ground truth. Just help nudge it and fix it." That's a good point. Okay, so you help working on it and then you realize a month later, wait a second, it's getting worse. We're doing things that's not good for the company. It's not creating user value. It's not good for the employees. They're burning out. It's just not good for anybody and it's getting worse. And so if you think you're going to go and hit the ground truth button, before you do, you'll be flying tackled to the ground by somebody and stabbed in the dark because you will destroy everything.

(00:27:13):
And so it becomes correct to hold onto this idea of if you acknowledge the kayfabe is false, then you are in danger of getting knocked out of the game. And so how do you do good things despite the fact that you're pulled in two different directions? And this increasingly in the limit, it can be good to a point where the easiest way is if I do, if I hold on this idea, we might create significant value for the company. If I let go of this idea, I die. So the easiest way to maintain this split-brain thing is to just turn this part off and just earnestly believe the kayfabe. This has been organizations become zombies, and anyone individually you talk to behind the scenes will agree yes, it could not possibly work. That turns out that these things work this way, and yet the entire organization lumbers on.

(00:27:56):
And this is a death state for large organizations. It happens all over the place in any number of different conditions, and this is one of the reasons it shows up. And I think acknowledging that is an important way to help navigate and still make good grounded things happen. How can you allow disconfirming evidence to show up that doesn't kill you, that helps make you stronger? And if it all has to come in one massive moment that could ruin everything, then you aren't going to hear it. And then it will build up and build up and build up and build up into a super critical state that could shatter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:27):
I was just listening to a couple podcasts, and a thread that came up in a number of them is some of the most successful leaders, their instruction to their reports is, "As soon as there's bad news, I need to know as soon as possible. Do not shield me. I just want to know all the bad news as soon as possible." Feels like that's one solution to what you're describing.

Alex Komoroske (00:28:44):
Disconfirming evidence hurts, and so you won't realize it because it hurts at any given moment. It's like, "Ugh, it's a distraction. We're just trying to get this thing done." And so it comes from a good place to not get it, but if you're busy, that's one of the reason you need to take a step back. We take a step back, you're a little bit calmer. You can absorb this as confirming evidence. It doesn't feel like an existential threat. It's really easy to get surrounded. If you are very powerful, you will find all the confirming evidence you need. And if it doesn't exist, it will be created for you without your knowledge.

(00:29:12):
And so this is one of the reasons that large companies are radically different than smaller companies. And one of the traps that you can get into of not realizing this dynamic is happening, and you can make very bad decisions if you don't understand that it's inherently what's happening because they're all, "Oh, we'll have some bad actors." No, no, no. If people don't play this game, this game is emergent. It shows up even though everybody hates it. And if you don't play the game, you are knocked out of the game. The underlying dynamic that must be true in any organization on a fundamental basis is you can't make your boss look dumb because if you do, they're the person who decides, "Oh, this person's not performing," or whatever. And that one little asymmetry, that one little fact, in most cases it does not matter. That one little asymmetry is what leads to the systemic compounding thing where you get these really weird dysfunctional emergent things that everybody hates, nobody wants, and yet nobody is in the position to change per se.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):
I love your caveat at the beginning that continues to resonate in my head as you say this. You're not cynical about, "This sucks." It's more, "Here's what I'm observing. We need to think about ways to get around this."

Alex Komoroske (00:30:16):
Yeah. Because I think so much pain and misery is caused by us being not acknowledging these fundamental, inescapable things. It's almost impossible. Entropy is one of those things. Entropy emerges because there's more ways to go away from a point than towards a point. It fundamentally must be true in really any universe you can possibly imagine. And so if you're going to fight entropy, you're going to lose at a certain point. It's like if you are aware of these things, you can find subsets of ideas that do work despite these challenges. And that's some of the stuff, the tactics I advise are often things that look playful. They look unserious. They look like, "Oh, you're saying you don't know the answer?" No, I'm admitting I don't know the answer.

(00:30:55):
And I'm saying it doesn't matter if I don't know the answer because this thing, this very small seed I am planting is so cheap that yes, I can't tell you for sure this will work, but I could tell you there is a chance that it'll work. And the downside of this is basically the opportunity cost of planting the seed in this one moment, and the person who's planting it enjoys planting it so that an opportunity cost really isn't that much because they get energy from doing it. So who cares? Plant a bunch of these suckers. If one of these grows into an oak tree, that's great. Don't try to analyze beforehand which seed is going to turn into an oak tree. If it's super simple to plant the seeds, then plant the seeds. And if it starts growing, then keep watering it. That's it. That's the thing.

(00:31:30):
And people sometimes will see this as like, I've been called in my list before because they said, "Well, you're saying that you don't know the answer to the thing." It's like no, I'm saying I don't have to know the answer to the thing. If on a systemic basis I let these ideas and then you respond to the ones that are working that are viable, it doesn't really matter if you didn't know ahead of time which ones were going to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
It's a great segue to talking about this core idea that again informs a lot of the way you think, which is this idea of building versus gardening, the magic of acorns. Talk about this general idea and then I want to follow some threads.

Alex Komoroske (00:32:02):
So much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like, "I have a plan, I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen." And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. And so what I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. So it's like a lead by gardening vibe. I don't try to pick the things in the system. I try to work with what I've actually got and I try to lean in on the ones that turn, I think are going in the direction that I believe is valuable based on constantly seeking disconfirming evidence.

(00:32:44):
And if you do this properly, it looks like magic. It looks like a thing. It looks like getting lucky because what you're doing is you're farming for miracles. And so on a systemic basis, I can't tell you which of these things will work, but I can tell you there's a very high likelihood that one of these will work in a way that is interesting and transformative. And so if you're looking and finding these seeds that have the compounding potential of if they work, they would start working at an accelerating rate, then you don't have to know ahead of time. To me this is, I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get building products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:26):
Is there an example that you can give from either from something you worked on or something someone worked on that came or true miss? Because I think people hearing this might be like, "But I got to ship stuff. I got to hit some goals. I don't have time to sit around and garden and plant seeds. I got to actually build."

Alex Komoroske (00:33:41):
If there's an ecosystem approach, if there's something that if it works, it'll be self-accelerating. So okay, what you're going to do this thing, we aren't entirely sure what's going to work, but if a developer writes a thing and somebody uses it, it'll attract more developers, more users, and then this would grow on its own. Then and it's cheap to do the little example of the thing. It's cheap to build a little open source, tinker the little thing and just put it there. And if nobody uses it, it's fine. It was fun to build. It took you three hours. It's fine. If someone does use it, then you just invest in incremental bit of unit each time that you find a signal that somebody is finding it useful and then you stop if you ever cease getting that information.

(00:34:16):
So I would use this. Anything that is shaped like an ecosystem that has some kind of network effect, and many things have network effects, have some kind of compounding loop. Compounding loops are not rare. They are, "Look." It's like truffle hunting. You have to know what you're looking for and find the dynamics of a thing that if it worked would work at an accelerating rate. Lots and lots and lots of things intrinsically have this shape. Anything with a network effect, anything where the power goes up with a number of users, but it shows up in all kinds of problems that we don't normally apply it to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:47):
Along the same lines, you also advise people to think more emergence-oriented versus top-down, kind of what you were just saying. But I think that's another really interesting way of thinking about the same idea, create opportunities for emergence, bottom-up versus top-down control. You just chat about that.

Alex Komoroske (00:35:03):
100%. I think the emergence is one of the most powerful forces if you know how to marshal it and you know how to work with it. And the only thing that's hard about it in my opinion is you're going to look like you aren't very serious. You're going to look like a weirdo. You're going to look like a cook. And one of the downsides, if you're working on something and you're doing the normal top-down approach where you make the plan, you execute the plan, even if the plan turns out to not be useful, you produce a thing and nothing interesting happens, no one can say you didn't work hard. But if you try doing this designing for emergence and something amazing happens, even once it happens, people go, "Ah, it's luck. Where was the miraculous moment, the heroic moment where you made that happen? So therefore you had nothing to do with it."

(00:35:42):
And this was the biggest unlock in my career actually was when I stopped my guts. I was promoted to director at Google. I was like, "Cool, I never want to be promoted inside of a large organization ever again." And the freedom to now do the highest impact work, even if I can't make it legible to the organization, was so powerful and I was able to 10X my impact for the organization because I didn't have to worry about making it measurable specifically in a way that would show individual work effort. And I think that's the hardest part. And you have to have, typically what I would advise for PMs, my approach at Google was 70% of my effort and my team's effort should go on things that everybody acknowledges are important and useful and create value. Maybe it's boring, linear value, but some kind of value. You're trying to minimize the chance that any other person in a company will say, "What does that team do anyway?"

(00:36:32):
This, if someone says this about your team, your team is on the verge of death. And so you're trying to minimize the chance that anybody wants to say that or thinks that it's appropriate to say that by clearly and unambiguously adding value. You're not saying this is the best team in the entire world, but clearly they're doing something useful. They're executing well. They're working hard. And of course that team should exist. Think about it, of course they should. But now once you do this, you have 30% of your extra time that you can plant all these seeds.

(00:36:55):
You can find interesting little things where maybe a junior PM on the team has an idea you think it's kind of silly, but they're really into it. And the there is this thing, it could work out great actually. If you tweak it like this, there is a potential. I could see how that could work. If that PM is going to work on that anyway, they want to do it anyway. Instead of saying, "No, no, no, we don't have time for that. Be a little bit more productive over here," say, "Go for it. Here's my concerns. I imagine this part might not work, but this part is really cool right here." And then if it doesn't work, then they've stretched their agency. They've executed. They've exercised their agency. They've learned. They've gotten stronger. They've grown. It has the upside if it turns out to actually work. And worst case scenario, the opportunity cost to doing the thing that helped them grow and they learn and they liked. So I don't know. Don't try to force it. Don't try to stop it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):
That's a really good example of actually how to go about doing that on your team. The way I've always thought about this is the visual I share with people is like, you want to create cover fire for your team where your team's just hitting goals, moving metrics, and then while with that cover fire, you're building the doomsday bomb inside, protected where no one's going to come and stop you.

Alex Komoroske (00:37:58):
Yeah, because one of the hardest parts about an acorn when you plant it is making sure a squirrel doesn't dig that fucker up. There's so many things that can destroy it, and just keeping it, allowing it some space and allowing it some time is the most important thing. And it's challenging to do, but that's why it's important as a leader to have enough credibility in the organization that people can see that you are doing useful work to give you the space, to give your team the space to do this truly great work. If you want to get your team to do good work, there's a million different paths to do that. If you want to get your team to do great work, there's no shortcut other than to have an extremely high-trust environment where people lean into their superpowers in a way that adds up to something greater than some of its parts. That takes time. It takes effort. It's very difficult to make legible up to the rest of the organization, but that is where great things come from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:46):
It reminds me of something Ed Catmull shared in Creativity, Inc., this idea of the ugly baby, that every new idea is an ugly baby and nobody wants this ugly baby. Everyone's just like, "Get this out of here," because every new idea is bad initially.

Alex Komoroske (00:39:00):
Yeah, it sucks. They're just like this ugly thing that barely works or... But this is why what I try to do is I try to see the greatness, the seeds of greatness in everything. Everyone and everything around me, I look for, I try to find and see, man, what is the most compelling part of this? And let me lean into that. And so one of the things I try to do when I meet with people, when I mentor them, I try with it within the first session or two, whenever I can get a hypothesis, I say, "I think your superpower is..." And I describe to them what I think I can see them being truly exceptional at.

(00:39:31):
And sometimes I get it wrong, especially if I try to do it earlier, but when people feel very seen and they feel acknowledged for that, they now are willing, they're going to stretch farther and they're going to respond to nudging feedback even better because they know that you're not trying to tell them be different. You're trying to tell them be more, and you now the nudges will feel less like a stop energy and more like someone who gets me and can help me grow even more. And you can get some amazing things out of people when you just treat them with the respect. I assume that everyone I talk to, everyone I talk to is interesting, has seeds of greatness in them, even if they don't recognize necessarily where they are.

(00:40:08):
Someone described to me actually this morning in one of my little dirt clubs I run about they help facilitate about treat everybody like the Buddha. I think is I'm messing this up, but this notion of imagine everyone you talk to is the Buddha, in a Buddhist mindset, and how do you see and find those seeds of greatness and treat everyone with respect intrinsically as an end of themselves. This is one of those things that you do to be a compassionate human. It's also, I believe, a way to maximize the amount of value, direct and indirect value, that's created. So it's one of those win-win-win-win-wins where just it's the right thing to do as a person and a member of society, and it's also the thing that can create a lot of business value and create real value in the world.

(00:41:57):
Coming back to a phrase that you used earlier, slime molds, I want to spend a little time here. So interestingly enough, the first time I heard about you and what got me interested in your stuff is I did a newsletter post with the company Perplexity about how they build product. And as they were describing how they organized their team, the co-founders described they organized like slime mold, and he linked to your deck about slime molds and I was like, "What the heck is this?" Can you just briefly describe what you mean when you talk about slime molds and how slime molds are related to the way companies are organized and how they should think of the organization?

Alex Komoroske (00:42:32):
Yeah. The main thesis of the slime mold deck is that the core dynamic that makes organizations hard to navigate as they get larger, even if you assume everyone is actively good at what they do, actively collaborative and actively hardworking, is this emergent force or coordination of finding the subset of projects to work on when everyone's super busy that everyone agrees and commits to and actually works on together. And finding this coordination cost grows with the square of the number of people who are working on that thing. And so what companies typically try to do is fight this or ignore that it exists.

(00:43:06):
If you're going to fight it, the one way to look at this is think of a company like a vehicle. When the company is very small, you can drive it, you can steer it like a sports car. As a founder, you are allowed to steer. Everyone acknowledges you are allowed to steer. They're never, "Why is he steering it that way?" So you, a founder, can help navigate an organization around an obstacle the organization cannot see or comprehend itself. The problem is as you steer, as you grow into the size, your organization goes from a sports car and you grow into the size of a big rig, if you drive a big rig like a sports car, you're going to be a danger to yourself and others on the road and you're going to grind the engine. And so you got to drive the car that you actually have.

(00:43:41):
So what I see a lot of things happen in large organizations, that people are just trying to ignore this fact. And when you drive, by the way, a car, your vehicle, like a big rig, when it is a big rig, people go, "Oh, it means to go slow." No, no, no. It means pivot less. It means have a little bit more... Be more intentional about the times that you adjust the steering, invest more in program management, invest more in processes, give a little bit more slack in the planning process to absorb any kind of surprising things that you can still all reach the product launch at the same time.

(00:44:13):
The other option you can do is you can split your thing up into a series a swarm of sports cars, individual sports cars. And the downside of this, you'll get the autonomy and strengths of the bottom-up, the downside is other people will externally will look at it and go, "Well, that team and that team clearly didn't talk." You'll say, "Yep, yep." You have to decide how bad that is for you. Apple has chosen the former. It's very important to them to have the illusion of perfect coherence in their products. It worked very well for them. They executed marvelously. And if you also picked the exact opposite thing, everyone else is like, "Yeah. There are like 15 different ways of doing everything. They clearly don't talk to each other." But it allows the overall swarm of the AWS product suite to be very powerful and anti-fragile or whatever you want to say.

(00:44:52):
And so slime molds, I think, is acknowledging that organizations are, especially ones that focus on autonomy and agency of their individual employees, which is a lot of tech companies, they are more like slime molds than we realize. And if you fight that fact, you're going to have a bad time. And if you embrace it, then you can start realizing slime molds are actually kind of amazing. They can find solutions to problems you didn't even know you were searching for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
Alex, you have the best metaphors. I don't know how you do this, but they're so evocative and correct.

Alex Komoroske (00:45:21):
I can tell you that the process I do if you're into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):
Please. That would be incredible.

Alex Komoroske (00:45:25):
I think by talking, I'm an external processor, I literally can't think if I'm not talking. And so I make sure I have as many interesting meetings as I can, and that's where I discover what I think, by talking to people. And the test is if I say a frame, something that the person goes, "Ooh," or like, "Ooh," they go, "Aha," that's a win. That's a mark that's a good one. You're just randomly casting about. I find one. And then if a different person also has a similar response, if a person in sales and a person in engineering both find the same idea interesting, that's a very good sign that lots of people will find it interesting, how diverse in terms of background skill sets, perspectives are the people who resonate with the thing you're saying.

(00:46:08):
The intuition of this is if you find in a social network, you want to see what's going to go viral, if something is shared and it's shared within, so the people who are at the beginning are all highly densely interconnected in the social graph, then the implied ceiling is relatively small. You only know it works with that audience. But if it's people that are very different subclass and very little overlap, they both find it interesting, that implies a much larger max audience. So you're looking for ideas that resonate with the diversity of people. And then once you find them, each time you get something like that, you invest a little more time in it and you think a little bit more about framing it the next time.

(00:46:42):
I haven't done this during this chat, but in most conversations, you'll see me as I'm talking writing down stuff like, "Ooh, that was the best formulation of that one so far." And so you keep on coming back to it. You keep on tightening it and seeing how, watching how it's responding and referring with different people through like, "Where do you get these from?" It's like I got thousands and thousands and thousands of little examples or metaphors or whatever that's sick.

(00:47:03):
One of the benefits of metaphorical thinking is you connect nine of the 10 dots and you invite the listener to engage with the argument to connect that last dot. This allows you by the way to say very controversial things, because if you say connect all the 10 dots and it's like, "Oh, that's the official strategy," then you are instantly a dangerous thing. Whereas if you leave one dot unconnected, people can go connect the dot and go, "Oh my god, I think that applies to us." You're like, "Oh my god, what?" "Yes, that's why I picked that." But to counteract this because now it's less obvious to people that's correct, you have to make the metaphor evocative and interesting.

(00:47:39):
One of the reasons that slime mold deck got so much traction is partially because slime is gross, it's bad, and yet it's talking about why slime is good. And so that has this instantly subversive thing. I only know this after the fact of trying to figure out why did that deck get so much attention of all the things I've written.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
It also is all emojis basically, which is not how you often read a deck. It's very beautifully made. I love that you've been talking about the way you think and come up with ideas is by talking to people and having conversations. We also talked about how you write in this Bits and Bobs approach. I asked someone that you worked with at Stripe what to ask you, and she said to ask you about strategy salons, which feels like a good avenue for this sort of thing. Can you talk about what these are and how you set these up?

Alex Komoroske (00:48:26):
So these I also call now nerd clubs, and these are my secret weapon. And I have a blog post. I started writing right before my second kid was born, and then he was born three weeks early and I just lost the plot and now it's like a 40-page draft of a thing that I'll probably never finish. But I've used this tactic. I discovered it many years ago as they strengthen some of the techniques I'd used in open source community organizing. And the situation was I was just joining a new team at Google. I've been there for many years, and there was at the time 12 different groups working in different aspects of this overall problem domain. And in classic Google fashion, they added up to significantly less than the sum of their parts, as in not like, "Oh, we'll see which one works," but, "These two things directly undermine each other. If you execute both of these strategies, neither can work." And I knew that if you try to do pairwise executive reviews on this very complex, ambiguous, open-ended problem, you would get really expensive pageantry that would obscure more than clarified.

(00:49:17):
So what I did was I created a secret group that I called Navel Gazers was the original one, and I wanted people when they hear about it, I want people to go, "That will be a club for nerds." They're like, "Yeah, do you want in?" And so this means that only people who intrinsically want to be in it for its own sake come in. So you get only a positive "yes, and" kind of energy. So then within these groups, you say, you set the norms very explicitly and say, "This is a collaborative debate environment. This is only 'yes, and'." If somebody says a thing in this group that is optional and secret and completely off the side of anything that matters, if they say something that you think is an actively dumb idea, you are free to not engage. Just leave it. That's fine. Because nothing's going to happen. We're deciding anything interesting or important here.

(00:49:57):
And if you want to engage and you don't like it, a productive way of doing that is saying, "Oh, that's so interesting. I would never would've thought to apply that lens. I typically would apply this lens to that kind of problem. I wonder if that applies here." And by saying, "I wonder," you make it about you, not them. And so that person can choose if that's an interesting thing to build on or not. This sounds by the way very non-rigorous feel like, "Ah, how can you possibly get rigorous thinking in the 'yes, and'?" It turns out there's limited amounts of time and so people will choose to build on the things they find most interesting. This is interesting things are surprising and potentially valuable. And so if lots of different people in the group are building on the same idea, that's a good sign there is something very interesting going on.

(00:50:35):
The third thing you do is you dribble in new perspectives. Every one to three a week, if you put in lots of new perspectives, once the norms can all scramble, if you have one in five people who all have a very particular kind of personality can mess up the norms, and so you're trying to minimize the chance you add a jerk. It takes one person to poop a party and go, "What are we even doing here?" You want to minimize the chance that happens. But second or thirdly and more importantly, you want to have as people with as different perspective as possible added into the group. And so this is what Ken Stanley might call, for example, novelty search. You're novelty-searching through the different perspectives in the overall thing.

# Scripts for navigating difficult conversations | Alisa Cohn (executive coach)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I want to dive right into talking about your advice on having difficult conversations, where like in performance review season, what do you suggest when someone's being told they're not going to get the promotion?

Alisa Cohn (00:00:10):
Hope for the future is so important. I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. It's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here, and so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
You're big on helping leaders understand that their job is not to make employees happy.

Alisa Cohn (00:00:29):
They're trying now to be the leader who everyone loves, but what really needs to happen very often is, we need to drive towards results. This employee continuing to not really do a great job at their job, you don't want to push them because you don't want to upset them. You don't want to give them difficult feedback, so you're just going to keep hoping it works out. Ultimately, that leads to the demise of your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
You have some cool advice on just how to make meetings more effective and how to especially end the meeting.

Alisa Cohn (00:00:54):
My three questions to end the meeting are...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today my guest is Alisa Cohn. Alisa is an executive coach who has worked with C-suite execs at both startups like Etsy, Wirecutter, Venmo, and DraftKings, along with Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, and the New York Times. She was named one of the top 50 coaches in the world by Thinkers50 and the number one startup coach for the past four years by Global Gurus. What I love about Alisa is that she gives her clients very specific and actionable advice. In her conversation, Alisa shares specific language and phrases that you can use when having a difficult conversation with your reports to make these conversations go much smoother and be less difficult. Also, three questions you should ask at the end of every meeting to make the most possible forward progress after each meeting. Plus, why your job as a leader isn't to make people happy and what you should be focused on instead, and a set of questions that she calls the founder prenup that you should talk through with potential founders to make sure that these are the people that you want to be working with for a long, long time.

(00:01:59):
There's also so much more advice. If you're a leader of people or a founder, and especially if you dread hard conversations, this episode is for you.

Alisa, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Alisa Cohn (00:04:54):
Lenny, it's so great to be here and thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
I want to dive right into talking about your advice on having difficult conversations. I personally dread difficult conversations. I feel like I practice ahead of these things. I'm like, "I'm going to say these things. It's going to go like this," and it never goes as well as I hope. I always say the wrong thing. I feel like this is very relatable. They're called difficult conversations for a reason.

Alisa Cohn (00:05:18):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):
I know you work with a lot of execs on this specifically, and what I love is you've actually come up with a bunch of scripts that help people make these conversations less difficult. So how about we talk through some of these scripts that people can actually start applying?

Alisa Cohn (00:05:32):
Let's do that. I love that idea. And also Lenny, as you just said, very relatable and also, so you're not alone. If I could ask you a question, if you're picturing a difficult conversation that you have had, should have, might have, and you're nervous about, it's hard for you, can you sum it up? What's hard about it? Because it's helpful to clarify what is hard about it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:56):
Great question. I just don't want to make people sad and upset, and I worry about their reaction, how to deal with that, and them just getting really upset and mad and just like, "Oh, man. This really made things worse." So I worry about the reaction, I guess.

Alisa Cohn (00:06:11):
Okay, about making things worse or about their reaction?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):
The reaction, just making someone upset and sad. I don't want to do that.

Alisa Cohn (00:06:17):
Making someone upset. Okay, good. And again, you're not alone about that. Just one more question on that. What's the problem if they're sad and upset? What does that mean to you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:26):
Oh, I love this life coaching we're doing. Yeah, so it's like what happens if they get sad and upset?

Alisa Cohn (00:06:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:36):
I feel like it's stuff that I'm going to have to deal with. It's like this drama all of a sudden, this new fire I have to think about. And yeah, it's like the additional work it creates and also just, I don't know. Yeah, it's a good question.

Alisa Cohn (00:06:48):
You can think about it some more, right? I'm not going to put you on the spot right now, but just to say for all of us, the reason they're difficult, to your point, they're difficult. But we're putting meaning on things all the time, every day, all the time, and I think it's important, it's actually helpful in motivating you to have difficult conversations, but also in helping them go well. If you can get to the bottom of what you're putting on top of it, what you're weighting it with, because I can understand that again, you are not alone. I don't want to make people upset. Totally.

(00:07:20):
And also, I would just say on the other hand, when you're enlightening someone or you're working out a situation with someone and it's difficult, if you don't give them the opportunity to hear what you have to say, if you don't bring this up, then you're never going to have the opportunity to help them see something differently or help them improve or help you improve the relationship or whatever it is you're trying to do. And so, I can understand it's a natural thing. I don't want to make them upset.

(00:07:51):
No one wants to make anybody upset, but through that upset on the other side of that, can often be a whole new possibility and a whole new revelation, and actually a lot of joy and freedom. I think that we forget about all the other possibilities that come out of difficult conversations and we just land on these really uncomfortable parts about like, "oh, it's going to be a lot of extra work" or like, "They're going to get uncomfortable or even maybe cry." And I think it's just really helpful to tap into what you make it mean and then also what other possibilities it could mean.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:23):
I love that. And it's one thing to hear that and say that, it's another to actually feel that deeply and feel like I shouldn't be as worried as I am. I think part of it is doing these enough times where you're like, "Okay, it's actually not so hard." And the other is having some of this support. To make this even more real, let's give some examples of what we say when we say difficult conversations. There's like, "You're not getting a promotion that you thought you would, we're going to let you go." What other examples or common difficult conversations that you run across?

Alisa Cohn (00:08:50):
Those are two very common ones. And then of course, the most common one is just difficult performance feedback. Or [inaudible 00:08:56] what we say, quote unquote, "constructive performance feedback," which we never made positive. It only is the sort of things that you're not doing well. I think there are two flavors of that. One is, "You're screwing up" and the other is, "Developmentally, I'd like to see you add something or change something."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):
Yes. And as you say that, one of the other fears I have is them just disagreeing and me feeling like maybe it's not right, maybe I'm wrong and feeling shit maybe. I didn't see something and then just looking worse after the whole thing.

Alisa Cohn (00:09:27):
Yeah. And so then I think what's also really helpful to, and part of the process that we can talk about this for sure is getting a difficult conversation is number one, tapping into what's uncomfortable for it, for you, about it. And then number two, also getting your mindset right. So to say the obvious, are you doing this to hurt someone's feelings? No, never, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:49):
The opposite.

Alisa Cohn (00:09:50):
That's not the reason that anyone's doing it. Sometimes people are giving the performance feedback or talking about something that's been bothering them in order to express themselves and vent. And actually, that is very helpful to identify for yourself, that's why I'm doing it. And then, maybe not do it then, until you can transform your reasoning. But at the end of the day, the hope is as a manager, the reason that you're giving someone this so-called constructive feedback is because you're helping them get better. You need them to change the behavior. They'll never get promoted if they keep doing that. They'll never be successful if they keep doing that. And so, it's your job as a leader and as a manager, to help them out of that problem and help them do something different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:33):
The best story I've heard to make that really real for me, I think it was Kim Scott when she came on the podcast. She told a story of, I think it was Bob, where everyone just knew he was terrible and it was like, everyone's was just like knew he was not good and eventually, the boss had a conversation with him eight months into it and told him, "It's not going to work out. You're just doing a bad job." And he's like, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I didn't realize that. If you told me, I would've changed." And everyone assumed he knew. And so I think to your point, this is to help the person. It's not not to hurt them.

Alisa Cohn (00:11:05):
Yeah, a hundred percent. One of my clients, he was running a division and one of his people was not doing it right, not doing it right, not getting the right kind of data, not having to do the right kind of analysis, whatever it was. We were talking about it and I said, "Well, how come you have another feedback with her?" And he said, "You know, she's just going to cry. She's just going to cry. She's older, whatever, she's just going to cry. It's going to be too uncomfortable, whatever." So we worked, we talked and talked and talked. I gave him a script. We really worked it out and he agreed that he would go in and have that conversation with her, which he did.

(00:11:40):
And he reported back to me and he was shaken. She cried. Of course she did. She cried. That's what he knew she was going to do. And so she was upset and she went home early and the whole thing. The next day she came in and she said, "Thank you so much for telling me that. I wish someone had told me that 15 years ago. I think I could have had a different career." And I think that is so meaningful for all leaders and people who are responsible for other people to understand that you're uncomfortable when they start crying, of course, or they have this difficult reaction or whatever. But honestly, the only way you're going to be able to help someone grow in their career and become the best person they can be is by leaning into these tough conversations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:23):
What I love about the scripts we're going to talk about, which we probably should transition to, is it's again, one thing to hear that and be like, "Yes, okay, I need to do this. I need to get better at typical conversations. I need to have that talk without someone that we should let go." It's another when it's like tomorrow is the meeting and you're like, "Oh, my God. I have to have this conversation now." And so, I love that you actually give people a really simple approach to how to lay this stuff out in various different contexts. So let's talk through some of these approaches and scripts you've come up with. What do you think would be a good one to start with?

Alisa Cohn (00:12:55):
Well, we can start with performance feedback and we can just sort of take a typical example. So first of all, once you've done your work to get your mindset right to kind of know what you're doing it, and then you just really want to really be able to wrap your mouth around the words. So what that looks like is practicing, and the script could be, "You know, Matilda, I want to chat with you about the way you're interacting with your peers. So what I'm hearing from them is that you're missing deadlines on a regular basis and not letting them know you're missing the deadlines, and that also you're not fully keeping your team up to speed.

(00:13:27):
And so they're kind of confused running around. Now, we both know that the most important way you can be successful here and also achieve your goals is to make sure that you are working with your peers in a way that's consistent and that they can count on you and you can count on them. So I wanted to let you know about this. I want to certainly hear what you have to say, but the most important thing is that we leave this discussion knowing how you're going to make sure that you're keeping your peers in the loop and also your team in the loop."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:55):
Yeah, there's so many elements there that are really interesting. Just focusing on what I'm hearing versus just coming from you or something you've done wrong. It's, here's what I'm hearing from multiple sources. I think that helps people. Okay, it's not just you and just like, "Oh, my manager hates me."

Alisa Cohn (00:13:56):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:14):
It's like, "Okay, other people are saying this." And then I love this phrase of, we both know where it's not just me telling you this. It's like, "You also know this. I know you're smart and you also know that this is, something is wrong here." And then this goal of, here's what we need to [inaudible 00:14:31]. You're like very clear call to action, almost action item, like leave this meeting with, "Let's just be aligned on this thing."

Alisa Cohn (00:14:36):
Yeah, thanks for calling those out. I hope, and again, what I'm trying to convey in my tone is also, "You know what? It's Tuesday. We got to have this conversation. I'm sure it's going to end well. I'm not mad." The whole point about my manager hates me, right? "I'm not yelling at you." The more even keeled and even matter of fact you can be about something that's kind of just run-of-the-mill feedback, the better. And I think it's just also what I didn't say before, and I think it's also important is that, as you are recognizing that one of your jobs is to give this feedback, is that you have to build a relationship with people so they can hear you through the lens of, "Oh, Alisa wants to help me." Not, "Oh, Alisa hates me. It's always a problem."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:21):
How did you start that phrase again? Because the starting is always the hardest part for me. How do you kick off the conversation? What was the couple sentences used?

Alisa Cohn (00:15:28):
I wanted to have a conversation with you about some things I've been hearing from your peers about the way that you all are interacting together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
Awesome. So there's an element of, don't make it feel like a huge deal. Just like, "I want to have this conversation with you about something." And it's just like, "Let's have this conversation and here's what we want to leave this conversation with."

Alisa Cohn (00:15:46):
Yes. And I can't stress enough that it's actually really helpful to also have spent some time with Matilda or whoever saying, "Great job on the way that project landed." Or, "Hey, launches, when they happen on time and they're smooth, sometimes we don't notice anything. I want you to notice, we didn't notice anything. That's fantastic. You did a good job in that launch," or whatever it is. Because then, you've had the conversation with them to give them positive feedback and point out what's working, that builds the relationship so that you have the lens of, "Oh, yeah. When something's working, they tell me. When something's not working, they tell me, too." That's how you build trust as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):
They want to be criticizing them [inaudible 00:16:25]. We need to have another conversation what we're hearing about, problems [inaudible 00:16:28].

Alisa Cohn (00:16:27):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:29):
Obviously, if you say it the same way every single time, they're going to feel like this is weird. Do you recommend it's this kind of Mad Libs approach or is it make it your own as much as you can? What are kind of the key? Or is it like, here's actually how you want to say it every time?

Alisa Cohn (00:16:42):
In my book and when I work with my clients, I give specific scripts and what I will regularly say when I'm working with my clients is, "Okay, so this is how I would do it," and then I'll land it for them. But they have to make it their own. You always have to make it your own and I don't think it's a problem of doing it the same way every time. It's not like people are going to notice you because you're talking about different topics, theoretically. If you have a formula that can work for you, that's going to motivate you to do it, that is what's important. And what's important is that it's neutral, not loading on or not venting on someone and not unloading on someone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:19):
I love that we started with this one because it feels like the most common one of just your employee is underperforming and you want to make sure they understand and adjust. What if you're not hearing something from a bunch of people? What if it's just your perception of their writing? You need to work on your writing skills or you're coming in late. Is there another way you phrase it where it's not, "I'm hearing it from other people?"

Alisa Cohn (00:17:43):
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. So I'll talk about writing. I think it would be something like, okay, "Matilda, part of your job is to be able to create these documents and I appreciate that you do them on time. What I've observed is that they can often be not as structured as I'd like them to be and they also lack a conclusion. So what I'd love you to do is look at these three or four examples of some folks who are doing them really well and see if you can model your writing on theirs. If you need to take additional classes or if you need help in any way, let me know. But ultimately, I want to get your writing to the level where everybody is appreciating what you bring to the table because the level of your writing really reflects the level of your thinking."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):
Mm-hmm. Wow, I like that. I'd want to follow your advice if I got that. So the way you started that is what I've observed, which also is not like, "Here's what I think" or "Here's what you just need to do." It's more like, "Here's what I've noticed, here's what I've seen, here's what I've observed about what you're doing." And then it reminds me of, what is it, nonviolent communication, that whole framework of just focus on what you see, not what is wrong with them, not what they've done. I guess, is there anything there you want to say of just the importance of focusing on what you've heard from people or what you've observed versus maybe what people often do instead?

Alisa Cohn (00:19:05):
Yeah, I mean you just really said it and I think it's such an important point, observable facts. The idea that this is not a judgment. This is not... Sort of as less judgy as possible is also very helpful. It makes it neutral. It's observable facts and it's also sort of based on expectations, right? So the writing is, we expect it to be at a certain level and it's not that way. And here are the reasons it's not, the specific reasons, it's not.

(00:19:35):
The way you interact with your peers, it's important to be at a certain standard, and here's why. Because when we all work together, we're going to be able to execute and when we don't, unfortunately we won't be able to. So you staying in sync with them is important and the observation is that they don't feel fully in sync with you.

(00:19:52):
And so every time we talk about this, it doesn't become this, "Oh, I don't know. I just feel..." By the way, some things you have to give feedback on and they are kind of a feeling and those are more difficult, but so many things if you do the work to really think about what is the observable data, I always ask my clients, what's my evidence that this is happening? And you have to spend some time thinking about it, but it's really worth it because it makes the feedback easier for you to give and easier for them to hear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):
Is there anything else along the lines of this specific type of feedback that is worth sharing before we move on to a different type of feedback?

Alisa Cohn (00:20:29):
Well, I think just that the reason, one of the many reasons that people have gone uncomfortable giving feedback is that somebody might get defensive or they might start crying as we talked about. And so I have a script also, which is if someone gets defensive, which is it's like I'm giving you this feedback and you're getting defensive and I say, "Well, let's pause for a second. First of all, I want you to know that I'm telling you this actually, just to make you better because I know how important your career is to you. I know how important the success is to you and it's important to me too as your leader. The second thing is, my observation is that you're getting a little bit emotional. I want to know if we can continue having this conversation now or if we need to kind of pause it. At the end of the day, we really have to have this conversation and I really want to see you make changes, but I understand you might need a few moments to digest it."

(00:21:18):
The importance of that for you is not even what you say, but that you have prepared and you are prepared for if someone has that kind of reaction and that you don't have to, yourself, react to it. You know, "No, I'm not doing that. No, no, no, no, whatever." And you can say, "Yes, you are." Now we're in a fight and that is not cool for anybody. It's certainly not cool for you as a leader. So it gives you the opportunity to recognize that you have another tool in your toolkit rather than just react.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):
So if you find yourself feeling defensive or they are just not hearing and just fighting back, the tool is just pause. Let's just pause for a moment and it feels like there's kind of two parts to which you just shared. One is, remind them why this is important to them and why you're talking about this. And then two is, if there's just emotions kind of taking over, give them a chance to like, "Let's just pause and maybe come back to this because maybe you're not in the right state right now to listen."

Alisa Cohn (00:22:18):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):
Sometimes people get upset when you mention like, "You're getting emotional," or I don't know. Is that a thing that you deal with of just like, "How dare you say I'm feeling emotional?" I'm just...

Alisa Cohn (00:22:29):
I'm not emotional. Why do you think [inaudible 00:22:31] emotional? Right, exactly. Yes, of course. Now, when someone's crying, they're obviously getting emotional. When they're defensive, it's possible that you might want to use a different word. I can see that this is really upsetting you or this is really triggering you, or I can see that the temperature between us has just changed. You could say something like that. I do think also it's helpful to know your people because sometimes you could realize that actually they can deal with that, but then sometimes you have to really [inaudible 00:23:00] the delicate words that you need to use to pause the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):
Yeah. And I find, to your point, it's helpful to you too as the person giving it. And I feel like sometimes, you may be feeling like I should just pull back and maybe I'm wrong, maybe they're right, maybe I should stop and instead this gives you a chance to know I'm actually, I can't. I need to stay strong about what I believe because I... You put so much thought and effort into this already, it's unlikely you're just like, oh, totally wrong about what you're saying.

Alisa Cohn (00:23:30):
Yeah, exactly. There's something going on. There's something going on. And then also, the whole point about it being a conversation is that actually it's a conversation. Actually, Lenny, if you have a different point of view, I would like to hear it. Let's talk about it, but we can't keep going on like this, where I don't feel I can count on you for whatever it is that we're talking about. So we need to have this conversation and recreate a set of expectations between ourselves. Ultimately, that kind of conversation has the potential to really build the relationship and build trust, and that's another reason I encourage everybody to get over their discomfort and to lean into having these conversations because on the other side of that, is a much better, stronger connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
And especially if you do them well.

Alisa Cohn (00:24:11):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:12):
Following this advice. So okay, so again, if somebody's feeling defensive, can you again say how you start that, if you notice that? And then I'll highlight the two elements again of the...

Alisa Cohn (00:24:25):
So the way to pause is to actually say, "Let's just pause for a second because I'm feeling the energy has changed and I can see that you're getting a little bit heated by what I'm saying and I want you to know that I have no intention of upsetting you. I just want to be able to talk to you about the things that are going to help you in your career."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):
Awesome. And I love, again, just the reminder of here's why this is important to you, here's the benefit to you and why this will help you. And then it's like, "Okay, let's just maybe take a pause and come back to this conversation if you're feeling like this isn't the best time." Awesome. Anything else along that line before we go to another type of a hard conversation?

Alisa Cohn (00:25:02):
I mean, I can talk all day about this [inaudible 00:25:06], but I'm happy to move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:07):
Well, let's pick another topic. I know you have kind of five buckets and types of conversation. Maybe the promotion one. That feels like I think we're in performance review season. It feels like these are happening a bunch. What do you suggest when someone's being told they're not going to get the promotion they expected or wanted?

Alisa Cohn (00:25:24):
Of course that's challenging. So again, getting your mindset right, recognizing they're disappointed, they're going to be disappointed, recognizing how you felt, the time that when you didn't get a promotion or whatever. And so kind of coming to it with some compassion. And also, you have to get your reasoning right. So sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they were here for a year or whatever. Sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they're the only internal candidate who's qualified for this or they might have a sense of themselves succeeding or achieving that is more inflated maybe than you see them. So trying to think about where they're coming from.

(00:25:56):
And then the conversation is just, "Matilda, I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear. I know you were hoping to get that promotion, but I want to let you know that we are going to actually be looking for an external candidate. I want to give you a few thoughts about why. First of all, in discussing this with my peers, I'm realizing that we need someone who has done this role multiple times in the past and has that experience. Number two, I think it's really important that they have an expertise in a specific realm that we've identified as really important. So for those reasons, we're going to bring someone in from the outside, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. Number one, it's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here. And so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance. And then number two, when we bring this person in, I'm committed to finding someone who's a great people leader, who is going to help you build those skills."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:54):
So a few elements there that stood out to me. One is just being very upfront and not bearing the lead. Telling them very early, "Here's what I've decided." As you said it, I could see my heart sinking immediately when I feel that. So at least that's over and then it's, here's why. And that starts to help you feel like, "Okay, I get it. I understand at least how you thought about this." And then there's the hope for the future, your painting of, here's how I can get there eventually.

Alisa Cohn (00:27:21):
Yes, that hope for the future is so important and I think sometimes we're such in a rush to kind of deliver the bad news that we forget there's a human being over there who needs hope for the future. And hopefully. If they're a good employee, hopefully they have hope for the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
I love that. Is there anything else to that script that you think is really highlighting or do you think I touched on the key elements?

Alisa Cohn (00:27:41):
I think you touched on the key elements.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:43):
Okay. And again, the way you started is, I have some bad news for you or I have some disappointing news for you.

Alisa Cohn (00:27:48):
Yes, because it's just [inaudible 00:27:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):
Just get right into it. Yeah.

Alisa Cohn (00:27:51):
Yeah, just get right into it. Yeah. By the way, the other piece on that might be, if it's appropriate, I'd love you to digest this information and then let's talk about it again next week to see what you've come up with or see how you feel about it because you want to send, this is not the script, this is for me to you. You want to send the, I care about you message because that's the other thing. In the workplace, people, they're going through all their feelings, all their emotions, disappointments. They're going to go home and tell their spouse, didn't get the promotion or whatever. It's going to loom large. It's going to be demoralizing.

(00:28:24):
When you, as a leader signal a lot, I care about you, I care about your feelings, I care that you're disappointed, I care about your career, you are always going to be able to help people stay resilient in the face of setbacks and ultimately, do extra work, do the right work for you and be engaged in your company because you've spent the time and energy making sure they know that even when things are not going their way, they have an ally in you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):
What do you do if they just disagree, if they're just like, "But I do have those skills and I don't think this is fair." Thoughts on responding to that sort of feedback? I guess, that's the defensiveness stuff.

Alisa Cohn (00:29:06):
Yeah, that's the defensiveness stuff. And again, I hope you've done your homework to identify that actually that person doesn't have those skills and if there is a [inaudible 00:29:16] for example, but I do have those skills or sometimes people, I think more, even more often, they don't respond to what you just said. They will instead explain to you that they've been here for a year or they're the only internal candidate or their peer got promoted.

(00:29:31):
Right, they'll sort of explain to you things which are not part of your decision-making process and then it's helpful for you to say something like, "Yeah, listen, Matilda, I really understand that you were thinking that after a year, you'd get promoted around here. And in the past, I do think because of the stage of our company, probably people have been promoted at that period. That's not the place we're at right now. As we scale, we really need to think about not just what we need for today and tomorrow, but for the future. And that's why I want these specialized skills in here. I think it's going to help the entire company."

(00:30:02):
So that's an example of a discussion that you could have. I do have the skills. That's kind of interesting. I'd love to hear what you see as those skills. And it's not a problem to have the conversation right there then, but if there's a "Yes, I do, no, I don't, yes, I do, no, you don't," that pushback is never productive. And so, that's where you want to probably again take a pause and say, "Listen, I totally hear you. You and I have a different point of view about this. I'm not sure if it's productive to continue to discussing right now. Let's talk about it again in a week. But I also want you to know this is a decision that I've made."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:39):
I love though, when they come back to you and like, "But here's X, Y, Z." And you're like, "That's not what I was saying necessarily." I love that you basically mirror back. I hear what, I understand you believe, I understand you've been here for a year. I understand you're the only internal candidate," like making them feel very heard. That's a really powerful mechanic there. That is a good tool. Is there another script that you think might be helpful to talk through that is a common hard conversation people have?

Alisa Cohn (00:31:05):
Well, the hardest conversation is firing someone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:09):
Let's do it. Let's get into it.

Alisa Cohn (00:31:13):
[inaudible 00:31:13]. I'm willing to get into it. I just want to say two things about that. First of all, when you're firing someone, the hope is that it's not a surprise to them. You've had multiple conversations with them that they're not living up to your expectations. It's essential because the truth is, you want to create a culture where people are not surprised by being fired. And that's not even true for this one person you're dealing with. That's true for the entire company. So just kind of getting in the mindset of recognizing that if you shied away from those conversations, kind of like, "You're the problem here and you have some catch up to do."

(00:31:43):
The second thing is that before you fire someone, I think it's helpful to have the conversation before the firing conversation because something you said Lenny is like, "Oh, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm not sure." And that bleeds into, "Maybe I haven't been clear with this person." Regularly with my clients, I'll say, "Okay, have you been crystal clear about what you need from this person?" And what they always do is the hand motion like well, sort of, but well, maybe. Which means no, which means no. You've not been crystal clear or you don't perceive even crystal clear. The way to make sure that you're crystal clear is by having the conversation before it comes to that.

(00:32:23):
What that looks like is, "Listen, Matilda, we have to have a difficult conversation right now. I've talked to you multiple times about coordinating with your peers and not having them surprised about missed deadlines, and I've talked to you multiple times about keeping your team in the loop on different things. After six months of these conversations, I want you to know that the peers continue to feel like that you're operating on your own without coordinating with them. And I continue to hear from your team that they're not fully on the same page. I need you to know that this is very important. I need you to fix this within the next 30 days. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say, we're going to have to find a way to part ways because I can't keep this going with you. I know you have it in you to change. I value all you bring to the table, but if you don't fix these things, we're not going to have a future together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
That is very crystal clear.

Alisa Cohn (00:33:20):
Yes, crystal clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:22):
Yeah. Okay.

Alisa Cohn (00:33:22):
What do you think of that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:24):
Yeah, that was great. So it starts with being upfront. This is a difficult conversation, just to set expectations. They're like, "Oh, shit." And then it seems like you come back to, again, multiple times this happened, observing here's what's happening. It's happened multiple times. I keep hearing from multiple people, [inaudible 00:33:44] be a problem. And so it's just like, "I need you to know," and you're just very clear. "Here's what will happen if this doesn't change."

Alisa Cohn (00:33:52):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:52):
Yeah. And I love that you also give them a little, there's always that hope for who they are and how you see them as. They're not worthless. It's just like, "You are great at a lot of things. You have these skills. You're great at blah, blah, blah, but still this is a big problem." And it's communicating how critical this is. [inaudible 00:34:08].

## Transcript

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:00):
You don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, "I'm going to make the next great AI company," I think that is the equivalent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than maybe anyone else in the world. What is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:20):
Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote.

Speaker 3 (00:00:24):
Fish where the fish are.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:26):
The biggest mistakes I've made have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:34):
It's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:38):
It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7. So many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively. I think the fundamental question is, do all jobs just become a single prompt?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today, my guest is Andrew Wilkinson. Andrew is the co-founder and CEO of Tiny, a holding company that's often called the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet. They own over 40 businesses ranging from Dribble to WeCommerce to the AeroPress coffee maker, and they focused on buying profitable businesses from founders and holding them for the long term. Andrew and his co-founder bootstrapped the business from zero to hundreds of millions of dollars in value, and Andrew personally was worth over $1 billion at one point. In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover a bunch of strategies for coming up with a good business idea, what common business ideas you should avoid, his experience automating much of his work and life using AI, and what that means for employment in the near future. Also, what he's learned about happiness and money and how they're not directly related, and also how getting diagnosed with ADHD and then taking SSRIs was the thing that most impacted his happiness in life.

(00:01:46):
This is both a powerful and also a very tactically useful conversation and I'm really excited for you to hear it.

(00:04:12):
Andrew, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:04:15):
Oh, thanks man, great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):
I've been wanting to chat with you for so long. There's so much that I want to talk about and I want to start with a topic that I know that you think a lot about and that it's also in the minds of a lot of people, which is coming up with a great startup idea and this is something that a lot of people are thinking about right now because AI makes it so easy to actually build your idea into something real, and I feel like this is something you spent a lot of time thinking about. I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than, I don't know, maybe anyone else in the world. I feel like you're in the top a hundred, top 10, something like that. I don't know. Does that feel right?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:04:51):
I've definitely had a lot of experiences and I've probably started or been involved with 75 different projects or businesses where I've been a primary contributor and I wouldn't say that's anything to brag about because I've been an inch deep in a mile wide. So that's been in a lot of ways kind of my Achilles heel is I get too excited about ideas and I start too many businesses, but as a result I've seen almost every business model under the sun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:18):
Amazing. Okay. Yeah, I think the benefit is for us is we get to learn from your experience. Let me just ask you this question, what is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:05:28):
Ultimately the best thing is something you're going to be interested in, but I think a mistake a lot of people make is they choose something that everybody is interested in. So for example, they say I don't know anyone that has hadn't had the thought, man, I would love to start a really cool restaurant or I want to have a cool cafe or something. And in reality, what they think about is how cool would it be to come up with an amazing logo or all fun stuff, design the menu and stuff. But in reality, operating those businesses is miserable and it's also a very hard business because every morning millions of people wake up and they go, I should start a cafe. But on the flip side, almost nobody wakes up every morning and says, "You know what? I'd love to start a funeral home," or "I would like to start a pest control business," or "I should start software that helps people fill out forms for the government."

(00:06:26):
And Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote. He says, "Fish where the fish are." And he gives this example, he says, "If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen and they're all elbowing each other out of the way. They're all using the best lures, the best fishing line, they all have amazing strategy. You actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition. And I think that's probably the most important thing in business is actually to find those niches where you can actually make real money because competition equals lower margin. The more competitors there are, the lower your prices have to be and the more competitive the business is ultimately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:19):
It doesn't feel intuitive to go after small markets and to find niches. So let's just follow that thread. Well, why is that actually a source of some of the best ideas starting really small and niche?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:07:30):
I don't necessarily think it has to be something that is small forever, but it has to be something that like I think about if you're a first time entrepreneur or a student or something, you don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, "I'm going to make the next great AI company," or "I'm going to launch a new bank," or something like that, something that is very, very rigorous and complicated and highly competitive and regulated, I think that is the equivalent. I think you really want to take the baby weights and start slowly building your muscle. And I think about my own experience starting a business, I was so lucky because the first business I ever started my web design agency, which became Metalab, that was so easy and it worked immediately because all I had to do was know how to build websites and be able to talk to potential customers.

(00:08:33):
And then once they said, "Yes, I will pay you $5,000," I just had to send them an invoice, do the work, and that was it. It was a very simple business. And because of that, I got immediate positive feedback and I built my own narrative. And my narrative was, "I'm good at business, I can do this, keep going." And then I went off and I started taking my money that I made from that original business and that's when I fucked up. So I went out and I started a pizzeria and I lost all my money. I started a designer cat furniture business, a online DJ school, a skin cream business, all of these things. I've just lost all my money almost immediately, but because I had that first win I kept on going. And I just think it's so critical that people choose a business where they get that initial win.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:22):
Okay, this is a great topic. This is just like how do you avoid creating a job for yourself that you hate? There's a lot of business opportunities and ideas that like, "Yeah, you can make this work," and then it works, and then you're stuck doing this thing running a restaurant. My wife tells a story where a friend started a coffee shop and then he's like, "I thought I was starting a coffee shop, but I'm just replacing milk and buying milk all day. That's my job now." So just kind of along those lines to help people avoid creating a beast that they didn't expect any advice for Just how to know this is maybe even though this may work and make money, you probably don't want to be spending your life doing this sort of business.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:09:59):
So I just started a pressure washing business. I was speaking at a local business school and after I spoke, one of the kids walked up to me and he said, "Hey, I'm an entrepreneur. I've started two or three businesses in the past doing landscaping and I'm not enjoying school." And so just on the spot, I said to him, "Why don't you drop out and we'll start a business together?" And I'd been cooking on this idea of a pressure washing business because I'd studied that industry a little bit and I knew a few friends who'd done it in other cities. And I had this unfair advantage, which is I owned a whole bunch of media properties where I could advertise it for free basically. And so we started this business and I think for him, he kind of had this moment of, do I really want to be washing people's driveways for the rest of my life?

(00:10:47):
And what I said to him is, "Look, if this gets to scale, you'll never touch a pressure washer unless you want to." If the business can get big enough where you can have employees, he can just focus on sales or digital marketing or whatever aspect of the business that he really loves. And I think that's the biggest thing that a lot of entrepreneurs miss. They say, "I don't want to do that for the rest of my life. I don't want to be in the back of a dry cleaner dry cleaning clothes." And to me it's just a question of scale. I think the cafe is a great example because a cafe, if it doesn't get to a reasonable scale is just a job.

(00:11:26):
There's a big difference between a business and a job. I think if you could start a pressure washing business where you're the only employee, yeah, that's a job, but if you can get to a scale where you can drive 10 leads a day, then you don't have to do any of the pressure washing and you just do what you love. So I think a lot of people have this kind of Protestant work ethic where they think, well, I've got to be the person to do everything. And I think they really need to lean into what I call lazy leadership, which is how do I get away from the things I hate as quickly as humanly possible? How do I be Teflon for tasks?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
It's interesting that this business is non-software related at all, this pressure washing business. So I guess just for folks that are coming up with ideas, and I imagine most ideas are there's a pull to make it software oriented, something AI is going to help build for you and help you run. What's your calculus on just going down a direction of real world physical business, like a restaurant power washing business versus a software just like what are the benefits of that direction when should someone actually seriously think about doing a business like a power washing business?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:12:30):
I think if someone's listening to this podcast, odds are they're someone who's kind of a digital native. And I think the question is, what's your unfair advantage and what are you great at? So for me, I think I have reasonably good taste. And so what I could do is I identify and I knew enough to identify great design and development talent, but mostly I was lucky because I was a talker. I was good at meeting with clients and selling myself. And so ultimately my highest and best use my superpower was sales. And so that can be applied to anything, anything where you need to go out and you need to sell a customer. And so really it just comes down to what do you get drawn to and then how do you find the profitable business within that? So here's an example. A friend of mine, he owns a restaurant and he said, "Oh, I love it. I'm so passionate about it. It's this stunning beautiful restaurant in my hometown."

(00:13:32):
And he said, "But it's really just a job for a few different people and we can't make any money at it, but I've been noticing that there's all these vendors that service the restaurant and those guys are making a killing." And so he told me about a business that cleans grease traps, another one that cleans exhaust vents for kitchens. So I think looking around and seeing where your passion is and then sniffing around within it, probably somewhere within your passion, there's an opportunity. So for example, I love movies. My happy place is a dark theater. That's the best way for me to de-stress is go to a dark theater and watch a movie and get lost in it. And probably about four or five years ago, I was like, "Man, how cool would it be to invest in movies in some way to be a part of that creative world?"

(00:14:26):
And so I started looking into funding movies and I realized that when you fund movies, like 90% of the time you lose all your money. And even if you do make some money, you rarely make a good return. But I spend a bunch of time understanding the industry and learning about it. And then two years ago I was in New Zealand and I met the founder of Letterboxd and I realized, "Oh my God, this is a business where this has a moat, so it has a network effect, it's a huge social network for film reviewers. It's something I'm passionate about and it's something that we can buy at a fair price." All those things came together and I was like, "Oh my god, I can invest in film now." In the same way I used to be a barista, we ended up buying the AeroPress coffee maker company. So I follow my passions and spend a long time learning different industries and then I find the profitable niche within.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):
Okay, and this is a great takeaway essentially when you're thinking about startup ideas, make sure there's some connection to something unique to you where you have some unfair advantage. This makes me think about Brian Armstrong. I saw him do a talk once and he gave this really amazing insight about why Coinbase did well and why he started Coinbase. And it's because if you look at his background, he had this really rare Venn diagram of background of computer science and I think it was cryptography and economics, which is the exact set of skills you need to start something like Coinbase. So I think the tip there is just what is that unique Venn diagram of skills in your background and just ideally what you're building connects to that and gives you an unfair advantage.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:16:02):
Well, yeah. I just met another UVic student at the local university student. She is interested in marketing and so she's gone out and she's found some local clients, so small restaurants and stuff and managed their social media and she said, "Yeah, it's okay. I can make a thousand bucks a month, but it's a lot of work," and the owners really want a lot for their money. And I said, "Well, if you just pivot that idea just ever so slightly, and instead of doing restaurants, you did realtors or wealth managers who have quite a large marketing budget and are used to spending serious money and it only has to work a little bit to make a lot of money for them. Those people, you can charge $5,000 a month."

(00:16:44):
So I think often it's you find your passion, your skill set, you zero in, and then you just kind of pivot and you find the most profitable way to do it. When I started my web design firm, I started mostly with local and small projects, but very quickly I found a job board in San Francisco where startups would share projects they needed help with. I could charge five times the amount for five times less work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:09):
This point about fish where the fish are I think is really important. You can start something that's awesome that you love, that you're so excited about, but nobody needs it. Talk a bit more about just what that looks like. What have you seen when you're thinking about ideas that tell you that there's fish but also not overfished as you pointed out?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:17:25):
I think it's hard like Warren Buffett has this great quote, "I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman." And I feel like in order to know what problems are valuable to solve, you kind of need to have valuable problems. So it's a bit of a hard thing because I remember when I was like 20, I would say, I hate how all the cat furniture I can buy for my cats is I bet people would pay a lot of money to solve this, but I didn't understand anything about the realities of that business model. I didn't understand how little people were actually willing to pay. I didn't have a enough life experience to go, "Yes, that's actually a worthwhile opportunity." And I think that being able to know what people would pay to solve the problem realistically is incredibly valuable.

(00:18:20):
So my example of a realtor selling a house, because I've studied that industry, I know that a realtor can make like 20 to $50,000 selling a single house. So I can intuit that they'd be willing to spend a lot of money if I have a unique way of getting them clients that'll buy houses that'll convert at a high conversion rate that is worth $5,000 a lead maybe, right? So I think you kind of have to understand the problem in depth before you really know. Because when I was starting out, I would go down every rabbit trail, every infomercial idea I had I would think was genius.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
Or people, I don't know, that don't have this experience, which is most people. Is there one thing you do, maybe a heuristic that gives you a sense, maybe there's something here, maybe there's a lot of fish, maybe it's a value of prompt or no, the soul tell me it probably isn't.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:19:12):
No, unfortunately, I think it's mostly gut. I mean Munger and Buffett talk about having a whole bunch of mental models in your brain and they form a latticework, right? And they all kind of piece together. And I feel like for me, there's so much of this that is, it's almost like I'm an AI model and I've trained on all this data of what works and what doesn't and what's a good moat and what's a bad business, et cetera. And when I see it, I just immediately know. I mean, I think all entrepreneurs are so lucky now to be able to go into Claude or ChatGPT and just say, "Hey, I'm thinking about starting a Botox clinic. Can you break down the numbers? Is this a good business? What's hard about it? What is the regulatory moat? What would my payroll look like?" I didn't have any of that and so I started so many incredibly stupid businesses, but I think there's no excuse at this point. You should be able to do it with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):
That's a really good tip actually. Then there's this point you made about boring is good. That's a really good piece of advice. A lot of people are going after flashy stuff, things they condemn on Twitter. Your advice here is boring is actually a really good thing because fewer people are going after it. Is that the general tip?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:20:22):
Totally. I mean, so I started this business, one of my first called Flow and Flow was basically Asana before Asana came out. So it was a way to manage your to-do's and projects with your team in a web app and we basically did the thing. We made the mistake that so many entrepreneurs make, which is to go after an industry that everybody goes after just like cafes. Everybody has the idea, man, I wish I could design my own project management system or my own to-do system. And not only that, but everybody loves new things. They love jumping around. I know me personally, in the last three years, I've probably used three different productivity systems and I love jumping around in them and I didn't understand that and I ended up losing $10 million trying to compete with venture-backed businesses and bootstrapping.

(00:21:17):
It was all my own money, poured $10 million, lit it on fire trying to compete with Asana because I didn't understand how the business world worked really as they had raised hundreds of millions of dollars and they were run by the co-founder of Facebook and it was a little bit like, I'm Fiji and I'm deciding I'm going to invade the United States in retrospect, just completely silly. Now on the flip side, if I'd taken that same amount of energy and I'd instead focused on, let's see, what's a really boring one I've heard about, there was a business I saw recently.

(00:21:52):
They were making $30 million a year and all they did was help people fill out forms to get government assistance in certain programs. So it'd be like your uncle is disabled and you need to access government funding. The process to do it is incredibly time-consuming and miserable and you have to fill out all these forms. They just have software that fills out the forms for you and it says, look, you're going to get $20,000 as a grant, pay us a thousand bucks, and that is such a boring, nobody wakes up and goes, "I want to make form filling software," but I think they would if they could make 20 million a year

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):
Along these lines of just bad ideas, things people shouldn't start, what are a few ideas that you think everyone thinks is going to be a great idea and then they do it and then they always fail?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:22:37):
Well, I think the biggest mistake, I can speak from my own experience, the biggest mistakes I've made business-wise have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better. So for example, me and one of my best friends about 10 years ago, we really wanted to start a bar. We just thought it'd be so cool to have a bar where us and all of our friends could go, we thought it'd be great for the city. We thought we can run this really high margin because we're tech guys, we know how to build systems, we're good at business, and we were utterly humbled. We realized that we didn't know anything about business compared to someone who runs a pizzeria. If you think about it, like my example earlier of if you run a software company, what has to happen?

(00:23:24):
You have to hire a bunch of nerds, they need internet connections and computers and you need to pay them and you need to coordinate online and everyone can work asynchronously. Nothing has to go right. It's not that complicated, at least at small-scale. A pizzeria, it's like if the baker doesn't wake up at three in the morning and start prepping dough, the entire thing is effed and all along the way there's a hundred different failure points from front of house, back of house, the deliveries, arriving on time, all this logistics. And so I think it's been stuff like that. I mean also I got into the news business, the local news business. I ended up buying an old paper in Vancouver and it's the exact same thing. It's like you can't take a brilliant management team and change a bad business model. Ultimately the business model wins.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):
This is really good advice. Basically if there's a bunch of dead bodies in that space, there's probably something there that keeps killing them that you're probably not aware of until maybe somebody figures something out, right? Once in a while, once in a blue moon, someone's like, "Okay, here's how we do this and then it works."

Andrew Wilkinson (00:24:34):
Well, look at Instacart. When Instacart came out, everyone said, "Well, Webvan failed. This is never going to work." And we still don't necessarily know if Instacart is a great business. I don't know, I haven't studied it, but I think it was like, okay, enough technology has changed that it can happen, but would it be easier to start Instacart, Amazon or Coupang or would it be easier to start an enterprise SaaS software company? Definitely the enterprise SaaS software company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
I see. So this is I guess is the advice there. The thing that is easy to start is the thing you should not do because everyone's going after that.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:25:10):
Well, it goes back to my gym analogy of if you're going to deadlift 300 pounds, trained for 15 years, you should have already had three startups and they should have worked and you've really built up the reps. And I think that if I was going to start Instacart, that's different than someone who's 20 starting it. Not that I would be good at it, but at least I would know what I'm getting into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):
Let's talk about something that is this endless debate on Twitter. Maybe it's a false dichotomy between lifestyle businesses, bootstrap businesses, this idea of not raising money, just making revenue, living off the revenue versus venture-backed venture scale companies feels like you're very good at the first bucket and a lot of people, this is their dream, "I'm just going to start something. I'll start a lifestyle business, make a few million a year, never raise money. Who needs VCs? VCs suck." Advice for deciding which route to go with an idea you have.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:26:03):
Well, I think it's just not true that a "lifestyle" or bootstrap business can't get huge. I mean, we bootstrapped the entire business and now across all of our companies we do almost $300 million in revenue. And the whole time I had been focusing on taking, starting small businesses, small ideas, simple ideas, often buying small companies and watching them grow really big. And I think that the only difference between what we do and what a venture capitalist does is the level of tolerance of burning money on fire. And I just haven't seen that If we choose the right businesses that aren't in incredibly competitive markets or where they have some sort of moat. So what I mean by that is a great brand or a network effect like a social network or something like that, I don't feel we're holding them back by not letting them light up a bunch of money on fire because these things naturally grow.

(00:27:12):
The numbers, I mean they're like balloons, they just go as long as we don't mess them up too much. So I think the decision ultimately comes down to how hairy do you want your big, hairy, audacious goal to be? And if your big, hairy, audacious goal is I'm going to start the next satellite business that creates some sort of crazy technological revolution. Yes, you're going to have to raise a venture capital unless you're already a billionaire or something like that. But if you're wanting to just tinker and solve a problem that you think is not going to be hyper-competitive, so for example, that form-filling thing or software that just does a narrow thing that doesn't require 20, 30, 40 million to be lit on fire before it can make money, then you can have a wonderful life and build a wonderful company that can scale into the hundreds of millions of dollars if you play your cards right without ever raising money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:09):
Per the story you shared with Flow where you're competing against a venture-funded company, if there is a venture-backed company in this space, is the advice you're not going to win competing with them most likely and try to do something else.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:28:22):
Well, look at Things. Do you know Things?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:25):
I have used Things

Andrew Wilkinson (00:28:26):
I do too. It's awesome. Things still exist and Things has existed for 20 years. It's run by I believe one or two or three people. It's not a big team, certainly under 10 people, it was, I believe, bootstrapped and it's just consistently delivered an exceptional product and built up a loyal following. They have their 10,000 true fans who use it, and that's enough for them, but they don't do a lot. They've been very intentional. They don't do any AI stuff, they don't have an API. They're not on Android. They're very focused and I think they have succeeded. But the question is, what would an MBA or a business professor say about their success? If the measure of success is did they maximize taking as much market share as possible and grow to be as big as possible, then the answer is no because Asana and other people have built multi-billion dollar companies.

(00:29:28):
If the goal is the founder has an incredible life, probably has three houses, flies all over the place, does whatever he wants, has recurring revenue and he gets to work with headphones on building beautiful piece of software that people love, then I think he's won. I am generally much more in the camp of the Things guy has won, not Dustin Moskovitz. Dustin Moskovitz is just playing a different game than the Things guy. And if Dustin Moskovitz was running Things, he'd be miserable and if the Things guy was running Asana, he would probably kill himself because he wants to put his headphones on and build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):
I wonder why nobody has come. It feels like just with lifestyle businesses, if it's working and you would think somebody would come in with more money and more funding and just eat their lunch, is the key that the market is too small for a VC to ever be excited and so that's why no one's coming for them?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:30:21):
I think so. I mean, I think Things probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know any of the numbers or whatever, but I would assume it makes between five and $25 million of revenue, which to a VC is not even worth considering a VC. For a VC to invest in your business, you need to have a story where it's worth 300 million to a billion dollars or more. So it's just not that exciting to them, which again, going back to fish where the fish are, you don't want to be fighting against the commercial fishermen. If you just want to have a little business where you get enough fish to feed your family and your village or whatever, find the other fishing hole. Don't go where the trawlers are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:04):
This is great advice if you're trying to start a non venture backed company is find. This metaphor just keeps working for us, which is fish where the fish are, but not where the professional fishermen are. Also, ideally not where there's just a ton of, I don't know, fishermen from all over the place. I don't know, solopreneur fishermen. Okay. Coming back to just starting a successful company, what would you say are the keys to an amazing business model, an amazing business broadly, what should you be thinking about and looking into? I know you spent a lot of time thinking about this. When you're buying companies, what are a few bullet points that you want to focus on?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:31:38):
What I do for a living is basically buy businesses. So in my early career I started one business, then I started about 10 more, and then I realized starting businesses was extremely hard and I was doing pretty well. I was making quite a bit of money and I'd sold one of my businesses and I was looking out at the next 10 years and really asking myself what do I want my career to be and am I happy doing what I'm doing? And the answer was no. I did not starting businesses and experiencing that failure rate, it was incredibly stressful. And so I picked up a book about investing and I got lucky. The first one I bought was about Warren Buffett, and for those that don't know, Warren Buffett is he's counter to every VC kind of hustle culture thing you might hear because he basically just sits quietly in a room and reads all day, despite owning 260 different businesses and being one of the 10 wealthiest people in the world, his life is incredibly calm.

(00:32:44):
He only does what he wants and he spends most of his time quietly reading and once or twice a year, he makes a big decision to buy a business. And so when I read about Warren Buffett, I just thought, wow, I'm a sucker. I'm running around like a crazy person trying to run all these businesses. Why am I not just buying businesses and letting them run? And so when I'm buying a business, what I'm really looking for is something that I can't mess up. Right now, obviously we buy a business, we try not to mess it up, and we're very intentional, actually very odd in that when Tiny buys a company, we generally just leave them alone. If they already have management in place, we say nothing changes, no one should know that we've even bought them. Obviously people know that, but really there should be no change whatsoever.

(00:33:31):
The only change that we generally make is if the founder wants to leave the business, then we'll bring in a CEO to run the company, and that's probably the most important decision that we make. So I'm looking for a business though where it is so good that it's hard to mess up, and most businesses are very easy to mess up. One person leaves and the whole business falls apart because it's held together with dental floss and duct tape. And so I'm really looking for what Warren Buffett would call a moat. So a moat is basically a brand, so that could be a brand like Coca-Cola, Tylenol, Advil, something like that. So something that gives you pricing power where you can consistently charge and you have loyal customers or where we usually find a lot of opportunity is in network effects.

(00:34:23):
So typically we're looking for a community that's gotten so big where people don't want to go elsewhere. So for example, we own Letterboxd, which is the largest social network for film lovers. And the question is, if someone else wants to compete with us, why would someone go to their social network that has a small number of users when all their friends are already on Letterboxd? And so you see that same kind of thing with Instagram or Facebook or similar. And so we're looking for businesses like that, something that has staying power that is hard to compete with and that we can hold over the very long term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):
It was interesting when Elon bought X, how that was such a test of the power of network effects. If you think about it, back then he changed the name. So the brand completely changed the team. 80% of the people left. What was left, it was the network and the network effect and the simplest way. Just for folks that aren't super familiar with network effects, the way I think about it is just network effect is where every additional user that joins the network becomes more useful for everybody.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:35:27):
There's another moat, which is high switching costs, which I don't really like because it's not really very consumer friendly, but an example might be Salesforce where no one wants to, they've spent years and they've done all the implementation and trained everyone on it, and it's kind of the standard, everybody hates it, but ripping it out and switching is such a pain in the that they just won't bother. That's another form of sometimes a great business, but again, that's more depressing. I don't love that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:56):
What's the last company you guys bought?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:35:58):
We bought Serato. Serato is the largest DJ software company in the world. So if you ever see a DJ playing and they've got a laptop in front of them, probably using Serato to DJ.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
Wow, that is super cool. What I'd like a funding to be walking into.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:36:14):
I used to DJ so I was aware of them and it was one of those moments we talked about earlier where I understood the business. They had a really interesting mode of this huge passionate user base and deep hardware integration. And I also love DJing and I was able to analyze the business and luck comes to the prepared mind and it worked out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):
This is another great callback to your excellent piece of advice of just ideally what you're working on, whether you're starting the company or buying the company, is you have a unique unfair advantage or some kind of unique background that connects to that idea. Let me ask you one more question before we shift a whole different topic, hint, hint, AI. Something that I know you talk a lot about, something you believe strongly and something you deal with a lot is when you buy companies is just as people and the challenges of management and hiring and people. So what have you learned about just how to successfully, I don't know, find amazing people, keep amazing people, help people be more successful within the companies that you operate?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:37:15):
My business partner, Chris, has a really great quote. He says, "There are no problems. There is only people problems." And so we've found that you could tell us that there's a disaster that one of our business units is about to fail or something like that. As long as I'm surrounded by really great smart people, I feel fine. But when we have a bad actor, we have a psycho or a narcissist or a really horrible, difficult person we're dealing with, all bets are off and life becomes incredibly stressful. So I'd say I spend probably 20% of my time just trying to make sure we're filtering people very carefully and ensuring we're working with people that we enjoy. And I could talk about it in the AI, I've done some really interesting stuff to help me screen and identify difficult people, but I've just found that the biggest mistake I made in my early career was I would hire people because I liked them on gut and I would think that I could change them.

(00:38:12):
So it's kind of like in romantic relationships, it never works out well. If you get married to someone and you go, "Okay, well this is going to be a great relationship as long as I can convert them to Christianity or I can change their parents or their personality," or whatever it is. And so I've just found that I've never been able to change someone. You can never mentor someone out into being a good employee. And the kind of heuristic I have is if I ever think, should I fire this person even once, I should fire them immediately. It has always been a signal, at least for me, that when someone's a superstar, I can't imagine firing them. I think it's impossible, I'd be lost without them.

(00:38:56):
But when I repeatedly start going, "Man, is this person going to work out?" Almost always within six to 12 months, it doesn't work out. And so I really try and be really direct about stuff like that and just cut when it's not working. So I'd say the lesson really is hire for what you need. Don't hire just for potential, which is counter to what a lot of people say. A lot of people say hire for potential and coach them into being whatever you need. I just haven't found that. I think you need to hire someone who already is fully formed and can do what you need. But again, everyone does it differently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
This is big advice. Powerful advice. Is this true not just for the CEOs of the companies you run? As for folks under lower down the ladder too?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:39:39):
Well, for CEOs, one of the most interesting things we've observed is, so I'll give you an example. We had a CEO come in and we were interviewing them and in my opinion, the business needed to grow via organic marketing. In his opinion, it was enterprise sales. And so when we're interviewing him, he keeps going back to his experience building with enterprise sales. And there's this great saying, "To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail." And so for him, he's looking at this business and going enterprise sales, that's the way to grow. I hire him, but I say, "Look, if we're going to hire you, we need you to do the organic marketing." Lo and behold, of course, he goes off and he does the enterprise sales thing. And I've just found that hiring CEOs is like they're an elephant and you're the rider.

(00:40:31):
They're going to go wherever it is that they want to go. And so listening incredibly carefully to people's words and their experiences, because generally people will do the thing they tell you. So what I look for when I interview a CEO now, I want to be nodding along. I want to go, that's exactly what I would do or that's way smarter than my idea. And then I just leave them alone because I've found that anytime I try and pull them in a certain direction or coach them or whatever, it just doesn't work. And again, this could be my problem. I might be the world's worst coach and mentor, but for me, that's been what's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):
I imagine there's also an element of they won't love the job if they want to be doing say enterprise sales, and then they're creating viral TikTok videos all day and tweeting. They're like, "What the hell?"

Andrew Wilkinson (00:41:15):
Well, I've also found people will shoot themselves in the foot. If I tell them an idea in a board meeting and I say, "I really need you to try this," it never works because usually they sandbag it, right? They don't really put their heart into it or they're just placating me and they don't want it to work. They want their idea to work. And so I've learned not to do that.

Let's talk about AI. It's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed, AIphile. I don't know what the term is, and I love that you're not just the kind of person that just talks about it and tweets pontifications, you're clearly using it in every facet of your job and looking for more ways to use AI. So I have a lot of questions here because I think this is where more and more founders are going to be where you are today. First of all, just what's in your AI stack these days? What are the tools you find yourself coming back to most or finding most useful?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:43:10):
So the primary tool I use is a tool called Lindy, Lindy.ai. And what it basically lets you do is build workflows and agents. So it's very simple. You might say, "When I get an email in the Gmail API, I want to add an AI agent that reads the email and labels it based on that." Or you can build a crazy Rube Goldberg machine that sends different emails all sorts of different places. So for example, when I get an email and it's related to my kid's school, one of the big problems I have is that my kid's school sends so many emails, the field trip is on Thursday and you need to bring the following things. And meanwhile, there's parent teacher interviews and all these things get added to my calendar. The AI agent automatically takes that, puts it onto my calendar, makes sure there's notes for all the things I need to prepare and stuff. So I have just basically tried to take every single thing a human could do in my inbox and automate it with Lindy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):
And you're sitting there in Lindy doing this yourself or do you have people that you've trained to help build these sorts of things for you?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:16):
No, I do it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):
Okay. How many agents, if that's the term you want to use, do you have running for you roughly?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:22):
Oh man, I think I probably have not a crazy amount within... Let's see. Well, each workflow probably has four or five agents. So for example, my inbox has four or five agents, and then I have a whole bunch of other, I've got a calendar agent, I've got a meeting agent, I've got an email agent, I've got a scheduler, I've got a CRM, and basically they're all different workflows. So the whole bunch of agents within.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Okay, and you're not an investor in Lindy, right? You're just a fan, super user.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:53):
No, no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):
Fun fact. I actually am. So this is great.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:56):
Oh, no way. That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:57):
Tiny angel investor. So just want to put that out there, which I love that this came up organically. What are a couple other really interesting use cases, workflows you've built that people might be inspired by it?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:45:08):
Let me go through the email one a little more. So basically emails come in and the first agent says, does Andrew even need to see this? Let's say you're in a thread and you've already chimed in and everyone's just saying, cool, that works. I don't need to see that. So just archives that never. So that immediately reduces my email by about 20%. Then it decides is this something that is time sensitive? Is this something that needs to be dealt with in the next 24 hours? And if so, it labels it in a special 24-hour label. So when I go in my email, one of the biggest stresses I find is I go, "Shit, there's 200 emails in here, and if I don't go through all of them, I don't know if there's an emergency burning somewhere." So now I do. Then it takes any email or every single email and it decides, is this a simple decision?

(00:46:00):
So for example, let's say you email me and you say, "Hey, do you want to get lunch?" So it emails me privately and it says, "Hey, Lenny wants to get lunch. Do you want to say yes? Do you want to say yes, but in a few months? Do you want to say no? How do you want to say no?" And it gives me multiple choice. I just can say four, number four, and then it'll email you as me and it'll write out a nice thoughtful email or whatever. So stuff like that is so freaking cool and helpful. And I'd say that it's replaced stuff that my full-time, I used to have a full-time assistant just working on email that's all completely automated and there's all sorts of other cool stuff I'm doing there. Other agents, I'm working on one right now to manage my calendar, which is really complex. I do a lot of scheduling and a lot of rules. I have another really simple one. It adds emojis to every single calendar event. So when I look at my calendar, I've got beautiful little emojis for every single calendar event. Very silly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:00):
What are the emojis? Do they represent something?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:03):
Yeah, so if I write weightlifting, it'll just do a guy weightlifting or whatever. I've got one that, this one's cool. Basically what it does, every time I email someone, it looks them up online, it figures out what city they live in. It checks my CRM and air table. It says, "Okay, I don't know where do you live."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:21):
In Marin, in the Bay Area.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:22):
Okay. So it'd say, "Okay, you email Lenny, he lives in Marin." It puts in the database you live in Marin. And then next time I travel to the Bay Area, the agent will see two weeks before and it'll say, "I saw you're going to San Francisco. Here's all the people in San Francisco you should try and have coffee with." Right? So just all these things that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):
I would pay for that.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:43):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. All these things that I've dreamed of having my assistant do that my assistant could just never consistently do because she gets distracted, we're doing an event, there's something going on. It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7.
