# Feeling stuck? Here's how to know when it's time to leave your job | Ada Chen Rekhi

## Transcript

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:00:00):
It's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us. Which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard [inaudible 00:00:42] experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ada Chen Rekhi. Ada is an executive coach and also the co-founder of a product called Notejoy. In her coaching practice, she focuses on helping founders scale themselves. Before starting her company, she was senior vice president of marketing at SurveyMonkey. Before that, she started a contact management startup that was acquired by LinkedIn where she ended up leading LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team. Two fun facts about Ada. One, she started her current company with her husband, which we chat about whether that's a good idea or not. Also, her brother is Andrew Chen of a16z fame. In our conversation, it explains how to make better decisions with a framework she calls Curiosity Loops.

(00:01:21):
We do a live exercise around my own personal values. She shares a bunch of advice on how to intentionally and practically build your early career path. How to thrive as a woman in Silicon Valley, when to get a coach and what you can do on your own without one and a ton more. Enjoy this episode with Ada Chen Rekhi after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:40):
This episode is brought to you by Sprig. Next generation product teams like, Robinhood, Notion and Loom rely on Sprig to uncover blind spots in their product development process. Sprig let's product teams collect user insights fast, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. One of the things I love most about Sprig is that they're all about getting product teams the specific insights they need in the timeframe that they need it.

(00:02:07):
As of today's, Sprig is making that even easier with the new and improved templates library. On this podcast, you've heard a lot about how useful templates are for companies as they grow. Sprig partnered with some of the top product teams and product thinkers to build proven playbooks, specifically to solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today from how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow to troubleshooting drop off. Sprig helps you build better products. Sprig now has a library of more than 85 templates that you can use to get started collecting user insights quickly right in your app. I especially love that Sprig builds templates specifically for product teams, and I was really excited when they ask me to create a template around product sense.

(00:02:47):
One of the questions they get most is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to build a playbook along with Sprig on how to do that based on my experience at Airbnb and from what I've learned interviewing top product folks like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to build your product sense. Explore my product sense playbook and the entire Sprig templates library and build better products faster. Check it out today at sprig.com/templates. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/templates. Ada, welcome to the podcast.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:03:20):
Thanks. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:22):
So I've heard such great things about you from a lot of people, including a bunch of guests that have been on the podcast. And you also have this really great event diagram of maybe an ideal guest for the podcast. You've done growth. You've done products. You've started a company. You're also an executive coach to founders. So there's a variety of topics I'm excited to begin too. So thanks again for being here.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:03:22):
Yeah, I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:45):
An interesting thing that I'll start with is that when we were chatting about what to focus on in our conversation, where you're emailing about this, and you did something that I thought was really interesting. You ran something called a Curiosity Loop where you pinged a bunch of your friends and asked them for input in this really structured way. So I thought I'd start there. Could you just share what this process is, so that we can learn how to maybe do it ourselves, this idea of a curiosity loop?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:04:08):
A curiosity loop is essentially going to a whole bunch of people. In this case, I sent out an email very quickly to about 10 or 11 people and asking them, "Hey, here are nine topics for Lenny's Podcast. What are two or three of the topics that resonate with you and why?" And I got back such an incredible amount of information for about 20 minutes of work. I don't normally do this, but I actually showed you some of the anonymized feedback from people really just talking about what resonated and what didn't. So I came out of it just so much smarter, and curiosity loops are my method of doing so.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Often, people ask friends for advice on just like, "Hey, what should I do here? What can I maybe talk about on this podcast?" Your approach had a lot of structure to it. So maybe two questions just like, what is the actual structure to this concept? And then two, just people... You can often ask friends for advice, but you also don't want to over bug them with questions. How do you think about just not over asking everyone questions all the time, but all decisions you want to make? So I guess the question is, when do you use this versus just not?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:05:12):
I think that there are heavyweight and lightweight ways to use this. So the heavyweight way was what I just exemplified by saying, I sent an email and I made a doc. And on the other side, I had all of this really interesting and rich data. The lightweight way to do this is really just make it your ongoing theme of what you're curious about as you interact with people. So maybe it's this thing where every single day as you talk to people, if you have a social topic, you might just bring up the same question over and over again and start looking for are there any differences or surprises in what people are telling you? One of the big reasons why I think curiosity loops are really useful is that it really fights the fact that there's a lot of bad advice out there.

(00:05:54):
And it's not bad because it's not well-intentioned, but it's bad because it's not contextual. So when someone tells you to quit your job and chase your dreams, or they tell you to sit tight and grind through and build some experience before you go off and go start the company that you've always been thinking about starting, which piece of advice do you actually take? Right? A lot of it depends on your situation, what you're considering, what skills and experience you actually have, and curiosity loops actually are this way of really thinking about how do you make your advice contextual. So I'll break it down a bit in terms of how I think about structuring it. So the first piece of a curiosity loop is really just thinking about asking a good question. In the time when I was working at SurveyMonkey in the past, I had this opportunity to spend a lot of time with the survey researchers, and we really talked a lot about what makes a question good.

(00:06:44):
So in this case, a question's good if it's specific, if it solicits rationale, and it's not biased. You don't want to start a question with, here's what I think because people have this tendency to want to please you or to agree with you. So a good example... Well, let me start with a bad example of a question. A bad example of a question is, what should I do with my career next? It's just such a poorly formed question because it's really vague, it's not specific. It puts a lot of cognitive load on other people, and the output that you're going to get from it is probably going to be similarly bad. Garbage in, garbage out. A better example of a question might be something like, "Hey, you know me. I'm a marketer. I've been thinking about doing this webdev thing. So my plan is to quit my job, do a webdev bootcamp and then go find a job elsewhere. Do you think that's a good idea?"

(00:07:45):
There's just so much rich data to actually explore with that. First, are you suited to being a developer? Are webdev boot camps effective? What's the state of the economy in the hiring market right now for junior web developers? And that's an example of maybe a question that's a little bit more specific and gives people something to anchor on. So that's the first piece. The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you. And then after that, you really want to ask the question. And this touches on what you said about how do you make it really lightweight?

(00:08:41):
Ask the question in a way that really gets you a useful constructive answer, but doesn't put too much weight on people. So what I usually like to do is just make it very lightweight. So in your case, I said, "Here are nine topics. Can you pick your top two and tell me why you like them?" Some people went above and beyond and scrolled through and gave me feedback on every single topic. Some of them just said, "Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid." I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer. Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.

(00:09:35):
And then finally, to close the loop, I think a big piece of it is processing that information and then thanking them for it. So a big misconception that people have when they're really getting into this work of asking for advice or input from other people in the community is often that it's really one-sided. I'm asking you for help and you're getting nothing out of it. The reminder that I would have for all of you is that it feels really good to help someone. It feels really good to be heard and give input. And a big piece of that is, if someone comes to you and they said, "You gave me this advice, it changed my life. Maybe it's not at that level, but it really affected my decision and here's how it turned out. Thank you so much." That feels so good, especially if you only spent a few minutes giving them the input that enabled them to make a better decision.

Lenny (00:10:21):
So to summarize, I wrote these pieces down. The concept broadly is if you want advice on a decision you're trying to make, pick some friends and this is... I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:10:55):
I would try to optimize for getting at least three or four responses. It just depends on the nature of the loop. And then you think about what is your response rate. So if you're emailing really busy people that you don't know very well, maybe you would assume that you only get half of people to respond. If you're emailing people really well and it's really lightweight like, yes or no, and here's why, then you might just send out a handful.

Lenny (00:11:22):
Okay, awesome. So it's five to 10 people, broadly sounds like. Oh yeah, you want to make it really quick and easy. So it's like, here's 10 things, which of these two do you think I should focus on? So it's a quick ask as something you recommend, and then just thank them for it after you finish. Is that broadly the approach?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:11:39):
Yep, that's the approach. One thing I want to note is that it's actually really useful for personal things as well. So we framed it in this professional context of, I'm trying to change a job. But one example that I have is when we had our daughter who's now three years old, one of the debates that my partner and I were having was how do we actually set up our estate planning in terms of if, God forbids, something happened to both of us. How should she inherit the state? And my partner was basically saying, "18 years old, she gets everything fully unlocked." I was saying, "Oh, well maybe 25." And we're at this impasse. And we actually just started to tell each other, why don't we, in our day-to-day conversations with folks that we trust in our family, people that we think are smart, that have kids ask people what their perspective is on it.

(00:12:28):
One thing was really telling, no one out of everyone we asked said 18. So that really dragged my partner up. And then the other thing that was really interesting was that we learned a little bit about executive function and the research around it. So executive function, which is your ability to make decisions and plans and be thoughtful peaks at the age of 30, and it's all downhill from there. So bad news for people like me that are older.

Lenny (00:12:54):
And then I'm getting [inaudible 00:12:54] or game over.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:12:55):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:12:55):
Just like I'm-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:12:57):
But if you're thinking about 18, you are so far from your peak. So it dragged us both up in terms of what our set point was to make a decision like that. But we wouldn't have figured that out without a curiosity loop because it's too much work to dig through papers or research or whatever else to try to come to a good decision on it.

Lenny (00:13:14):
So the core lesson here is just, versus just emailing a bunch of people, asking for advice, which I imagine people often do, just what should I do here? Creating a little bit of the structure and even calling it a curiosity loop, I bet, helps people feel like they want to be a part of this and participate and help.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:13:31):
Yeah, definitely. One of the things that I always try to do is I try to explain to people in my ask, here's why I picked you. So for example, I picked you because I really trust you to be a sound source of truthful advice and give me some feedback. So I really value that. Do you mind spending a couple of minutes and just giving me some thoughts on this?

Lenny (00:13:53):
And how often are you pinging people? If you're a friend of Ada, are you getting curiosity looped every week, or how often? What's your rate limit?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:14:02):
I usually reserve it for bigger things. So probably quarterly or anything where I'm having a big debate, and I'm feeling really indecisive.

Lenny (00:14:12):
Awesome. It also makes me think about this idea of a personal board of directors, and this feels like an asynchronous approach to that concept where instead of a call every, I don't know, quarter month with small group, it's asynchronous. Here's an ask I have-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:14:24):
Totally. Yep. I think this is really based off of the marketing concept of customer advisory councils. So when I was working in marketing and product at a startup, one of the things we would always have is a group of our top customers on DM, basically. And if we had really interesting product conflicts, we would actually just go ping a couple of them and ask them, "Hey, we're debating this. Do you mind just giving us your quick thoughts and telling us why?" And then being able to as a marketer come back to the product conversation and say, here is the literal voice of the customer and four or five different verbatims on what people think about this really enabled me as a marketer to have a seat at the table. And the insight and the helpfulness of that was really something I wanted to bring to my personal life as well.

Lenny (00:15:07):
That's really interesting. It's basically user research for your life. User research, you're told don't do what people tell you to do. I guess it's the same thing here, where it's just like, here's advice and then you end up making the decision for your own own life.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:15:19):
Right. Right. Yes. That is the big caveat. Don't do what people tell you to do. Take it as an input and look for the hard feedback. Look for things that you strongly disagree with or are surprises to you. Because to me, I think these loops are more about looking around the corner and seeing if there's anything you missed in terms of the integrity of your decision making process.

Lenny (00:15:43):
Sweet. You said that people told you what we should not talk about. They're like, "Don't cover this." What was in that list?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:15:50):
So I think there were two topics on the list. The first one, it was just how do you onboard and hire and bring people onto the team? And the feedback I got there was like, "There's just so many people who have done this. I'm sure you have some interesting concepts, but I personally wouldn't be that interested in hearing it. And that was really useful to me. And then the other one was actually just about being a woman in Silicon Valley and the experience of that. I actually had someone write, and you probably read this, Lenny, "No. Stay far away from this. There's no winning on this topic."

Lenny (00:16:23):
Oh, my God. Okay, let's touch on that topic rather than, it's going to be great.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:16:28):
Yeah. So let's ignore the advice?

Lenny (00:16:29):
Yeah, let's ignore it. Before we get to that, I wanted to first talk about you. You gave me some homework also ahead of this chat. And the homework was around helping me figure out values and personal values for myself. I did the exercise. So first of all, can you just maybe talk about what this exercise was, and what the goal of it is? And then I'll share what I come up with.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:16:51):
So the homework that I gave you is similar homework that I give to everyone that I work with in coaching, and it's this values exercise. It's this 10 to 15 minute exercise where you're presented with a list of words that might encompass potential values. It's pretty lightweight. You just go down the list, and you pick out all the words that resonate with you, and then we filter them down into groups of values, and then we filter them down into a stack rank and a list. And the output on the end is basically three to five sentences that cover what are the values stack rank that are important to you right now in your personal and professional life? And what I really like is, it's this internal scorecard of what really matters to you in your decision making process as opposed to the external scorecard of status, money, wealth, how other people perceive you, that often we feel really pressured by. So it's this great way to look back and see how well do decisions, or how well do my situations in life align with my values?

Lenny (00:17:53):
Sweet. And what I liked about it is, if someone were to be like, "Hey, come up with your values." I'd be like, "Oh, my God. I'm just sitting here thinking about words and concepts." And it was really helpful because it was basically multiple choice. Here's all the options across tons of categories, just keep picking and then helps you whittle them down. I ended up with six. I feel like that's one too many. Actually, I added a bonus one because it's just one that I really like. But should I read through what I came up with?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:18:18):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Lenny (00:18:19):
So here's what my values, I guess. Choose adventure, stay optimistic, treat others you want to be treated. Classic. Keep getting better, act generously. And added one that my grandma taught me back in the day that has stuck with me, that had nothing to do with this exercise, but I just wanted to have on this list, which is, first do what you need to do, and then do what you want.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:18:44):
I love it. What a great list of values and what stands out to me from that list too, Lenny, is this idea of achievement or status or success. A lot of the things that we talk about publicly, what your LinkedIn feed might look like don't actually show up in your values. And it must reflect in some of the choices that you've made in your life.

Lenny (00:19:04):
Yes, I hope so.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:19:08):
Let me ask you this. Let's try to apply some of the values in real time as an experiment.

Lenny (00:19:14):
Oh, boy.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:19:15):
If you think about a recent decision that you've had to make or a decision that you're facing coming up, can you share what that decision might be? And then let's try to apply the values to it to think about if you were living up to these values, what choice would you make and maybe some of the pressures you might feel to choose otherwise.

Lenny (00:19:37):
So an ongoing decision I have is I have all these opportunities of things I can be doing. Additional things I can be doing. The podcast, this actually was a good example of I never wanted to do a podcast because I really wanted to... Life is good. I was writing this newsletters, doing great, making a living, doing one great email a week. And I was like, "Why would I do anything more? This is good." So I've constantly resisted, I resisted the podcast for two to three years, and then eventually succumbed. And it was a great decision in the end. But now, I have other things that I'm trying to not do, but they're always pushing into my mind space like, a book for example. Of course at one point, and I paused that just so I could have more time for the podcast. So I guess the decision is just like, what should I say yes to versus say no to?

(00:20:26):
I'm looking at my values a little bit, and one of them is choose adventure, which you would think would be just do stuff, just try stuff out. But I feel like maybe it's just a missing bullet point here of, I just want to do less. I'm trying to take on less and do less and cut out and-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:20:44):
That's really interesting.

Lenny (00:20:44):
... simplify. Yeah. Because there's just endless things I could be doing, and I want to spend time with my wife. And now, my new child is coming in a couple of months, if all goes well. So that's where my mind goes when you ask that.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:20:57):
Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe if you were to decompose adventure, what adventure actually means to you and you go into that word list, you might actually just find that some of these opportunities like writing a book, at some point, it doesn't feel like an adventure.

Lenny (00:21:13):
Right. That's so true. The beginning of it is an adventure. And then that's such a good point because yeah, once you start a thing... Something I always say about this content creation life is like, it's easy to start. It's hard to keep it going, and it becomes just this treadmill of just, you have to keep creating awesome stuff basically for the rest of your life. I don't know how you get off the treadmill. Not that I'm complaining, but that's just a reality of this path. So that is such a good point that it becomes not adventurous very quickly. So that's really interesting.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:21:13):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:42):
I guess the other thing is just, what's a cutoff? What am I... I do a bunch of angel investing and so I'm thinking about just stopping that for a while just so I get up more time with my new child and just carve out things that maybe aren't as essential.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:21:55):
So on the values exercise, I think what you've done a really good job of is just really delineating, here are some examples of choices that you have to make. I think that there are some points in our lives where writing a book, it just seems really obvious. It's good for your career. It's the next level in terms of where you go from the community, the newsletter, the podcast and getting to that next level. But where I think there is value is these lists of values can help ground us from those obvious decisions. So in my life, to share a mini example of this, there have been a lot of cases where the next obvious step for me might be to go an executive at a big company and to go chase the dream and continue on the latter climb of my career.

(00:22:40):
As I've examined my own personal values, a big piece of it has really been around prioritizing relationships and really pursuing knowledge and growth on my own terms. And things like independence and autonomy have started to creep up over time, especially once I started a family. It became very clear to me that sometimes the external scorecard of what people think you should go do is very much an opposition of what I actually want to do. Even though it might be objectively better, depending on what scorecard you actually use, I would actually be less happy with some of those outcomes. So I think values are this really nice useful tool to think about how do you make better decisions again to maximize for your own alignment with life.

Lenny (00:23:23):
That's such an important point. It connects back to the course that I taught and then this potential book of, it just feels like an obvious thing I should do. It was great, but it just didn't bring me joy. And other things bring me more joy. So it was a really good reminder of just like, do I really want to be doing this, or is this just a thing that feels like a smart thing to do but maybe isn't for me psychologically? So I love just the reminder of coming back to values as a lens to decide if you want to do a thing versus just, what are people telling you? Smart or... Which just feels like the natural thing to do.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:00):
Yeah, and it's really self-aware of you too. I think too. Cut it off because you start realizing that you're doing this course, and it's not giving you energy or it's not quite the right thing. It's really hard to say no to things.

Lenny (00:24:12):
It is. It is.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:12):
And I don't think we focus on that enough.

Lenny (00:24:14):
Yeah, I've learned how to do that better. I have all these auto templates of ways to say no in different ways. Actually, ChatGPT, somebody's tweeted this that it has all kinds of good suggestions. If you could ask it, how do I say no to my manager who wants me to prioritize a feature? And has all kinds of clever words to [inaudible 00:24:30].

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:30):
Oh. Yeah, that's a great use for it.

Lenny (00:24:32):
The other thing that I realized as we were going through this exercise that I imagine you find also is when you come up with an initial set of values, I was realizing I maybe another value of just keeping things simple, simplifying. And I imagine that's part of the process of narrowing in on what's important to you is you take this first pass and then you try to use it in making a decision and then you realize, oh, there's this other thing that's really important to me and that updates your values.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:24:57):
Yeah, I think you could definitely use that process to force yourself to make a stack ring and to be really clear, and also change it. Change it. It's yours. So change it over time as it suits you.

Lenny (00:25:08):
All right. It feels like there should be a curiosity loop AI bot with your values that you email, what should I do with this decision? And then it's like, oh, you think simplicity is great? You should not do this.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:25:20):
The next big idea.

Lenny (00:25:22):
There we go. Somebody build that. Okay, so it's funny we went into reverse interview, and then I have to asking questions again. So let's do this. You talked about your career and how you resisted these shiny object opportunities to focus on the thing that you were excited about and wanted to do. So maybe a couple questions there. One is just early career advice. You coach a lot of founders. You had a really in incredible career doing all kinds of interesting things. What have you learned about what works best for optimizing in your early career?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:25:55):
My early career was pretty wild. So I had a really fast run. Over the course of seven years, I went from my first job, which was basically this entry level sales job at Microsoft, working on Microsoft adCenter to SVP of marketing at SurveyMonkey, leading a global team. And when I reflect back on what works across my early career, it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit, which actually sounds dark now that I'm saying it out loud, but-

Lenny (00:26:27):
Yeah, sounds great. I love it.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:26:29):
Explore and exploit, if you're familiar with it from growth background, is really just around what mode you're in. You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it, how well it works, whether or not it fits for you. Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more. And when I think about explore and exploit for early career, it's all about exploration. You really haven't experienced that much, but you're doing it with a thesis. You're doing it with that growth mindset where you have a hypothesis. So coming out of school, my first job was at Microsoft. I was at adCenter. The big thing I learned from the 367 days that I was there was that corporate life at that point in my career was just a little bit too slow-paced for me, and I was really hungry to go do something else.

(00:27:19):
But I also learned quite a lot about marketing and advertising. And I had the suspicion that not only did I want to try something smaller, but I also wanted to try marketing. So I moved to this series a startup where I had to sample my desk on the first day called Mochi Media. And I was in a marketing role at a startup and had this great run there over three years, where I learned all kinds of things and even tried product at some point. What I learned from that experience was then I love marketing, games was pretty fun and being in a smaller team was really dynamic. It was this choice on, do I exploit and go deeper into the industry or do I explore more? I was 23 at the time, so I decided I have so little to lose, let me continue exploring. My big thesis was, let me try being a founder. So then I founded Connected, and Connected was this personal CRM that's a little bit like Clay.

(00:28:14):
If you've seen Clay now recently, in terms of how do you do a better job of managing and building your professional and personal network and-

Lenny (00:28:20):
Yeah. It's a beautiful product.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:28:22):
Yeah, it's a beautiful product, much more beautiful than what we built at the time. It was such a great learning experience to discover what it was like to be a founder of a company and an entrepreneur. My personal learning out of all of those things was really just that I was continuously optimizing that I loved marketing. I loved being a founder. I really like small teams. There are pros and cons to this corporate life, where maybe things are really slow paced, but the scale is really important. So that was really what carried me through a lot of my early career. After Connected was acquired by LinkedIn, I moved into this exploit mode.

(00:28:59):
So I was at LinkedIn for a period of time while I was investing, and I really wanted to be intentional about the time that I spent there in terms of how I wanted to exploit it. So unlike a traditional path where you're really focused on trying to get the biggest title, a big team, set yourself up to run a big org, my role at LinkedIn was really explicit. I even told my manager this when I first came in, "I'm here to learn to be a better founder." So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it. So if I can make my LinkedIn experiences match to that, that would be a huge win for me independent of promotion, or compensation or a whole bunch of those things because the plan afterward is actually to go off and start another company.

(00:29:53):
So I managed to get into this great role leading gross marketing for LinkedIn, working with their growth team from a hundred million to 200 million members, read every experiment brief that I could, spent a lot of time with the team, really understanding their process, and then shifted into the subscription side where I worked on LinkedIn subscriptions and ran their sales subscriptions business at scale through the online channel. And saw how all of those pieces and worked together from a financial planning and analysis stage to all of the optimizations that they did. It was just such a rare opportunity, but I wouldn't have gotten those opportunities if I just let them promote me or I followed a strategy where I was just focused on trying to get the biggest title.

(00:30:35):
Instead, I was focused on those learnings and those experiences. Ultimately, the fact that I was a startup founder. I had big company experience. I had growth experience, and I had subs experience. And I was a product marketer. That was actually the winning combination that caused SurveyMonkey to send me a LinkedIn InMail, start a conversation and ultimately bring me in as their head of marketing at the age of, I think I was 27 or 28 at the time. Because their rationale was, you have all these experiences that we really need and you don't have the management experience, but we have plenty of that. We're happy to teach that to you.

Lenny (00:31:10):
I really like this framework. I've never heard it described this way. Explore and exploit connects a lot with what I always recommend which, early on, is to optimize for a variety of experience so that you can figure out where you actually have a good time and what you're interested in versus getting stuck on the first thing something. I don't know if you'll have an immediate answer to this, but I'm curious. Many people don't know how long to stick with something that maybe doesn't feel good but may lead to something. Like, someone may be in a job right now, or just like, "I really don't like this job, but I feel like it'll lead to something great. And I don't want to give up too quickly." So I guess the question is, what are heuristics that tell you to stick it out and stick with something that you think will lead to something great versus hold the recording and get out?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:32:01):
That's a great question, and it's a really tough one that is contextual on the person that you are. So one of the things that I like to share is this idea of, it's a little gory, don't be the frog. So if you are familiar with the story of the frog, it's this idea of boiling the frog. So if you take a frog, and you throw in a pot of boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you take a frog and you put in a pot and you increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive. And how I apply this to your question to come back and circle back to it is that, it's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them or we think, "Gosh, it'll get better. The next manager will get better. I'm always one conversation or one promotion away from getting to that next step."

(00:33:02):
But you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending. That's what makes the advice really contextual. I really look at it from the lens of learning. What can I learn here, and how am I growing and developing? So there might be an argument for you to stay at a job for two decades. If it turns out that every single day you're being really challenged, you're learning new things, you're deriving a lot of meaningful enjoyment out of your work and you're this happy frog that's hanging out, realizing that things are good and the temperature is not rising. But there are also situations where you might encounter just some really hard walls, where you don't get along with the thesis of the company. You don't agree with the direction of the company that you're in.

(00:33:53):
There are fundamental aspects of the role which are limiting to you or you're not learning a lot, frankly. I think that happens a lot, where you providing a lot of value and doing a good job at a company, but you might not be learning things that stretch you and grow you to achieve your ultimate goal. When you are aware of that learning, I think that's the point at which you have to say, "How do I change that? How do I be an agent in my own career and make a difference in that?" And it doesn't necessarily mean that the strategy is to quit your job and do something catastrophic, and then go do something else, take a course or sign up for something new. It might actually mean a proactive conversation with your manager or the leadership to say, "I love what I'm doing here, and I would also like to learn a little bit more. And here's what I'm interested in."

(00:34:44):
And then try to find a way to either land the right projects. So in my case, it was really growth and subscriptions, that experience that I really wanted. Let's say, you hit a blank wall there, even take it as a gift of time, which is great. I'm not going to be able to get this from my company, but now that I have this extra time because I'm so optimized at this job, how am I going to choose to use that time? And it might be around building relationships with some of the key people at the company or learning something new on your own time that you can leverage in another way.

Lenny (00:35:17):
I like that. Make the most of the time, even if it's not the best opportunity for you. Also love the frog boiling metaphor.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:35:23):
Little gory.

Lenny (00:35:24):
No, it's great. So I guess the lesson there is think about are you that frog being boiled right now and think ahead, is this going to be the end of the-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:35:24):
Right. Keep an eye on your environment and which way is it trending?

Lenny (00:35:35):
Yeah, the temperature on the thermostat in your office. The other thing this makes me think about is, it's so easy to get caught up in making your resume look amazing and continuing to just like, "Oh, if I get this next role, my resume's going to look so great." And this other logo and this cool title and role. I find that just like, you do that long enough in your life, you end up... You retire, and then you die. Life is that resume. Right? That is your life, you're living, and there's not going to be a point at which you have to realize, okay, I've done all the things to make my resume. Also, I'm like, "What do I actually want to do? Am I enjoying this?" Because it'll never end. You're never going to end trying to make a better resume and a more awesome background for yourself. Do you experience that with yourself or other people you work with of just over optimizing to make an awesome series of roles and logos and then forgetting, do I actually enjoy any of this? What am I doing?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:36:31):
I have experienced that personally a lot. I think that it may be a generational thing or it just may be my background, but having grown up with the Asian tiger parenting, it's very focused on logos or certain accomplishments or certain achievements like, going to an Ivy League school, working in a company that someone's heard of, being able to have a certain title. At a certain point, I bailed out a bit and I really started to think about who am I trying to please and optimize for? That values exercise that I had you do, Lenny, is actually a big piece of that. So I probably took it for the first time over a decade ago, at this point. I looked at those values and I said, "Well, if I draw a straight line from where I am right now and just extend it forward and play the rest of the movie as it plays out, given the current plot line, how well does that optimize for those values?"

(00:37:27):
That's great. My parents might be happy about my resume or other people might look upon me in a certain way because I've managed these achievements, but in my day-to-day life, what really matters to me, what's really meaningful to me, only some of this stuff really matters. So getting very intentional about that and being clear about who your audience is as you navigate your career. I think it's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us, which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.

Lenny (00:38:25):
I love this topic. Thank you for sharing that. This episode is brought to you by Sprig. You already heard me talk about how Sprig helps you uncover blind spots in your product development process, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. Just this week, they launched their brand new templates library, which you can find at sprig.com/templates. Which helps you plug and play proven playbooks for helping you identify and solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today. From how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow, to troubleshooting drop off. One of the questions I get most on this podcast and in my newsletter is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to work with Sprig to build a playbook for how to do just that, based on my experience at Airbnb and what I learned from interviewing top product people like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to develop your product sense, which informed this template that you'll find. Just go to sprig.com/templates to find this playbook and 85 more that is sprig.com/templates. S-P-R-I-G.com/plates.

(00:39:31):
What triggered your reevaluation of that path? Was there just like a, "Oh, man. I need to really rethink where I'm going." And then I have a follow-up question.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:39:40):
Really just a career opportunity. And it was this step where I could do something that was, at the time, really high profile and really exciting and felt great, but also involved demanding travel and grueling hours. And wasn't in a space that I was excited about, but it looked amazing on my resume. And I was talking to a friend about it, and they actually introduced me to this values exercise to say like, "Ada, go through and fill out this values exercise, and apply it to this job." What I realized at the time, after I did it, was that my top three values, the things that I cared about this job would categorically just fail at because I would be gone all the time, in pursuit of glory that I didn't really care about. Instead, my current path at the time was something that if I persisted in, it would actually be able to potentially fulfill all of those values.

Lenny (00:40:36):
It reminds me of a friend who has this metaphor of this ego monster sitting in the corner of the room that's always yelling at them, when they're... To do the thing that's impressive and take on the really cool role, and just get an awesome title, and do something really impressive, that's just like yelling at them from the corner. And my friend's just learned to just like, "Okay, that's the ego monster pulling at me. I don't have to listen to that. Doesn't mean I'm going to be happy if I listen to this guy." And that's been really helpful to my friend just to disassociate that part of the brain.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:41:10):
Yeah. The ego monster is a great way to put it. I use something that Warren Buffet has talked about, which is inner scorecard versus outer scorecard.

Lenny (00:41:19):
Tell me more.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:41:20):
So he talks about how there's an outer scorecard, which is how the rest of the world evaluates you, how you keep score in terms of external factors. So top 10 lists, wealth status, title, maybe things that people really care about. And then your inner scorecard is things that actually matter to you, how you spent your day, how good of a person you are. Did you have an adventure today, Lenny? Were you kind? And there are a lot of things that maybe are in opposition to each other. So really thinking about did you win at the cost of kindness? Did you succeed at the cost of losing access to the adventure that you really wanted? I think really thinking about it in that lens helps you trade off against some of that external pressure and the ego monster.

Lenny (00:42:11):
This might be a good segue to chat about coaching. I imagine a lot of people listening to this like, "Yes, I want to do that. I want to measure myself according to my values and check in on this. And am I doing the wrong path?" It's hard to do just on your own, I find. And I think that's one of the benefits of an executive coach. So maybe we just chat about what should people know about coaching and getting a coach, and does everyone need a coach and how to think about the idea of getting a coach at some point in their career.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:42:42):
I'll have a hot take on this, and it's something that I share to people when I talk to them about coaching. But my hot take is that for the vast majority of people, they probably do not need a coach.

Lenny (00:42:52):
Great.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:42:54):
And what I often push people on is if you're thinking about getting a coach, which is usually an indication that they have a feeling of being stuck or they have a problem that they're trying to solve, I ask them, "What are your goals when it comes to coaching? Roll it forward six months, what have you gotten done in your coaching experience. What have you accomplished, and you're just... It's like, a home run. And then look at all of the potential alternatives in terms of how you could have spent your valuable time and often pricey fees to achieve the same goal, but maybe in a better way." The thing that people don't really think about is if you're looking for a mentor, a coach is actually a terrible mentor in some ways because it's this one person's opinion. It's actually way better to run a curiosity loop, for example, and get the benefit a couple different minds on a specific topic and hit their wheelhouse of things that they know about. Than to go ask one person, what do you think I should do in this situation?

(00:43:58):
If you're trying to learn about a topic in a really robust way, let's say you want to learn about growth, maybe you should take are Reforge course and get access to all of the resources and the insights of the EIRs and the growth advisors that Reforge and get an overview and survey of the landscape instead of one person's experience and the handful of companies that they might have worked with. Likewise, if you're just feeling like you're a little emotionally overcome, I think coaches are this great resource around that, but it's actually better to pay it forward and build a tribe and a community of people around you that you can rely on for support because that's the thing that lasts you for years and years.

(00:44:38):
So one of the first things that I do when people talk to me about coaching is I challenge them and say, "Have you explored all of these other opportunities first, and do you really need a coach? And is a coach actually the best option for you?" Like an anti sell, just so that they know what they're getting themselves into because I don't necessarily think that it's useful for all things, even though it can be helpful.

Lenny (00:44:59):
And then when do you find that it's actually important and valuable and something someone should try to get?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:45:06):
I wouldn't be a coach if I didn't think that it wasn't important and valuable. I think that in certain contexts it can be super helpful. So when you have situations where you're in a state of hyper growth, and you need very accelerated learning, and you need someone who can point you in the right direction, I think coaches can be really helpful. So I work with founders for example, and founders are just in this unique state where everything is chaos. They have no structure. They don't know what their jobs are. They have fully justified imposter syndrome where no one in their right mind would objectively have hired them for the position that they're in. There's really intense highs and lows. So for a founder, it might make a lot of sense to get a coach because they have to learn a lot of stuff really quickly, and time is of the essence.

(00:45:54):
So a coach might be a really helpful shortcut for them to get there. Related to that, I think it's also really helpful on sensitive topics. So there are a lot of things that we want to be coached on where either it takes a lot of time for us to work through and progress because it's a long-term project, for example, or it's something very sensitive. People issues and interpersonal conflicts. Coaches can be especially helpful in those cases because it's this really safe space for you to work through things, but also have someone who's really rational to help guide you through them with potentially some frameworks and extra advice.

Lenny (00:46:30):
So I had a couple coaches in my career and what made me feel like I should pursue that is when you think about a sports athlete or, I don't know, athlete. No one does not have a coach, the best athletes have coaches and they get great because they have somebody helping them get better. It's not just like an accident. They don't just learn on their own. It just makes you realize that other people in their profession that have a coach helping them out are just going to be more successful because innately, they have someone helping them learn how to do the job better. So that made me realize, man, I should probably get a coach to help me out with stuff. Even though there wasn't anything super specific, I'm like, "Oh, I need to fix this problem." It was just like, wow, this just intellectually make sense. So it was actually really important and transformative for me.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:47:21):
If you go to my site, I actually have this guide that I've written over time on both my take on how do you find a coach, and the TLDR there is actually that I strongly recommend to everyone. If you're thinking about getting a coach, talk to two or three different coaches. And really get a sense of their vibe and how well you get to know them. It's surprising because I did this piece of research, which I also wrote about, and we could link to, but I talked to over 80 people about their experiences with a coach. I talked including coaches, including founders, including executives and there's this shocking data point in there where half of people that founder their coach literally went with the first coach that they talked to. It's that your buddy said, "I work with this great coach." And then you go and you hire your buddy's coach.

(00:48:08):
I think that's a totally fine way to go find a coach, but I would actually really just urge people to talk to a couple because what works for your friend may not work for you. And just being able to see some of the variance in terms of the style and how people get along, I think that can make a huge difference in terms of this reflection of how do you learn best? When you think about acquiring a new skill, do you love structure? Do you not like structure? Do you like it when someone really teaches you and walks you through specific examples, or do you frameworks? Coaches come in all of those different flavors. So I think it's really worth it to explore before you get into such a deep relationship with someone, just so that both people can feel really sure about it.

Lenny (00:48:51):
What's one thing that people may not think about or just something that you find really important that maybe is unexpected when you're looking for a coach?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:49:00):
I thought that credentials and the relevant experience of the coach was a huge factor in terms of how you should go about your coach selection. But part of the interviews that I did was talking to founders that had had experiences with coaches and asking them to reflect back, and these founders and executives when they thought about it, they actually said so much more about, it was actually this amorphous sense of vibe with the person, how safe you felt with them, how deeply you would explore with them, and how well they got you, and remembered the pieces of the conversation and help you put it together. Way more than potentially some experiences that they'd had, where this person had the perfect background, but they just never really connected on that level. So it was unintuitive to me that there was such a big piece of it that was around personal connection, which is why I've now pushed people to try to talk to a couple different people.

(00:49:55):
And then the other thing which comes back to the sports coaching analogy is that there are different coaches that are really good at different things. So just like how, if you're a star tennis player, you might actually have multiple coaches working with you, maybe an offensive coach or a defensive coach or working on a particular swing. It actually makes sense when you're really performing at a high level to consider having coaches that work with you on shorter term basis to really just work on your speaking or help you with getting into your groove on writing or help you achieve a specific goal. You shouldn't think about it as this long-term commitment to stay with one person, but instead more choosing off of a menu and thinking about what goal are you trying to achieve right now?

Lenny (00:50:39):
Does anyone ever get multiple executive coaches that... I like how we went from, you don't need a coach to maybe need a month [inaudible 00:50:46] hamstrings.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:50:48):
Yes. I know of multiple people that I've talked to, usually CEOs, that either have had a series of coaches or have multiple coaches. It makes a lot more sense, Lenny, when you think about someone who's getting a pitch coach because they're about to get into fundraising.

Lenny (00:51:04):
Got it. Right. Niche skills.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:05):
Right. For niche things because they're about to enter a process or someone who's trying to get into a writing coach-

Lenny (00:51:11):
Got it. Yeah.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:13):
... in addition to some of their executive and leadership work that they might be doing.

Lenny (00:51:17):
Okay. That makes sense. I love it. I'm going to get four coaches. One for everything I do

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:23):
A podcast coach.

Lenny (00:51:23):
Podcast coach.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:25):
A newsletter coach.

Lenny (00:51:26):
A writing coach, and a-

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:51:30):
Yes. And then a parent coach. Don't forget that.

Lenny (00:51:30):
Parent coach. A job board coach, and then just a life coach. Okay. I'm on it. Okay. So let's touch on the thing that your friends said we shouldn't touch on, which is being a woman in leadership in Silicon Valley. I guess I'll just frame it simply. Imagine there's many young women listening to this podcast, and many may dream of a career like yours, all the things you've shared. What advice do you have for young women just starting out in their career hoping to find a similar path?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:52:03):
This is a really delicate subject, and it's interesting because when I try to decompose why people gave me the feedback they gave me on this topic, I think a big piece of it is just that you want to have respect for the inherent challenges of being a non stereotypically great fit for leadership roles or certain career success roles in Silicon Valley and acknowledge that. And also try to push for some of the agency of the things that you can do. So I'm going to start with just this quick story about someone that I worked with who's given me permission to share this, in a coaching context and then back out. So I was working with a seed stage founder, and she's so smart. She is really dynamic, very, very focused, really, really great at taking feedback and actioning it. She's one of those people that is just stellar, and I have no doubt that she's going to make a huge dent in the universe.

(00:52:58):
We've been working together on Zoom for a couple of months, and I'd built this great respect for her competence as an operator, and the way that she thought and took apart problems and then acted on them. And then we met together for the first time in person at lunch. I feel almost nervous talking about this here. The disparity between my sense of who she was as an operator and how she came across to me initially at this lunch was really striking in that it was a weekday lunch and she was dressed as if she was hanging out on the weekend. So old T-shirt, hair back and in a claw, bra straps were showing. She was just incredibly casual in terms of her physical appearance. It took me almost like a little bit of a step back to reevaluate and think, "Oh, this is the same person, but she actually just presents so differently.

(00:53:54):
So then I took the step after we met and I gave her that feedback in one of our next coaching sessions where we invited each other to give each other feedback. I shared a lot of my impressions with her and I told her, "I respect you so much as an operator. I want to tell you that in the physical meeting that we had together, there was this disparity on how I would've potentially perceived you when I first met you in person versus what I've come to know about you from the months that we spent together."

(00:54:27):
Her reaction was like, "Oh my God, Ada. No one has ever connected the dots for me. Thank you so much. It has never explicitly been told to me that some of these elements which you describe, and they're very easy for me to fix and I'm motivated to fix them, are things that might actually trigger certain impressions or biases. No one's actually said it to me before, and I'm about to go into fundraising. It's actually super helpful for me to hear this, that these are controllable elements of my physical attire or my appearance that might actually just affect the way that people perceive me. And then it gives me this extra hump to get over, in terms of getting to this point of credibility for them to see me as a seasoned operator that I am." She took it so well. But what was interesting about it was actually that she'd made it all this way in her career. She'd even raised funding, and no one had ever given her this feedback.

(00:55:21):
So this is, I think one of the big challenges of being a woman in Silicon Valley because getting to an executive role or getting to a funded founder role, it's like an Olympic level sport. You have to get all the way through the funnel and become one of the few that are really chosen to do that. But the difficulty of this game is that no one tells you the rules of the game. You actually don't really know what are the rules on how to get intros or give intros. What's the right way to follow up? What are the impressions that people have about you? It turns out that in a career context, it's so unsafe for your manager to turn to a young woman on the team and say, "Here, let me give you feedback on your physical appearance, and how it affects your competence and how you're perceived in the workforce." That the vast majority of them will just never do it because there's no winning, which is similar to the feedback that I got.

(00:56:16):
SO where I lean in is to say, we're not powerless and there's something that all of us can do if we're in a position where we feel like not even about being female, it's about being perceived as too young or too old, too tall, too short, not the right race. Whatever reason that you feel people may be disqualifying you or not seeing you. We're not powerless, even though this game is rigged. We can study the game, we can help each other, and we can actually start to call out some of those rules and then find ways around them. In this case, for the founder in this example, she really turned to her friends and did a mini makeover and amped up her appearance.

(00:57:03):
And she came back and she reported, "A lot of people have been giving me really positive feedback, that something about me feels more confident and more energetic, and they can't figure out why." But actually, she was getting a ton of people noticing that something was really different about her in a positive way simply because I was in this great position as her coach to give her some of these pieces of hard feedback that she had never heard before. So it's really on us to try to find those and then try to adapt ourselves to play that game if you want to play at that level.

Lenny (00:57:33):
How nervous were you giving her that feedback?

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:57:37):
I was so nervous. I actually almost didn't do it, and then took a deep breath and then decided, what the heck? I think she's great. I think she would really benefit from doing it and I gave it. Even in a position where I'm in a relationship with her where I can have that trust, it was super, super difficult. So I can only imagine how hard it is for people to give feedback like that in another context, but how else are people going to hear it?

Lenny (00:58:03):
I think there was a company culture where they talk about how you're being selfish, not giving someone hard feedback because you don't want to be stressed or risk causing damage to your own reputation. But you're not helping them. So it's a really interesting insight of just like, don't be selfish. Do something that's hard when you think it's going to help someone else.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:58:26):
Right. But I think on the topic of being female or on the topic of physical appearance or maybe even some of the topics around being an immigrant, if you're in a position where you can give that feedback, I think the struggle is often will it be well received? And that's where the feedback comes from me from the curiosity loop for this piece, which was there's almost no winning in doing it because the upside is something great happens for them. But there's just so many downsides to giving advice or giving someone input like that the default course is just to avoid. But then that person never learns the rules of the game.

Lenny (00:59:05):
Yeah, absolutely. It makes me think also a little bit about Radical Candor, basically. I don't know if you read that book, but

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:59:14):
Yeah, Kim Malone Scott, I think.

Lenny (00:59:16):
Yeah. And Sheryl Sandberg had a similar story where she... I think Sheryl Sandberg gave her a really hard feedback and she didn't take it that well, actually. I think you did a better job, or your friend actually took the feedback and did something with it. I think the whole book was just like, "Hey, I actually do this where people actually listen." I think the framework is, you got to communicate that you care deeply about that person, but you want to challenge them directly also at the same time.

Ada Chen Rekhi (00:59:40):
Yeah, it's a great story. I think Sheryl Sandberg took her aside after one of her meetings and basically told her that, "If you say um, it makes me sound stupid." And she didn't take that well, but at the same time, later on in retrospect, she reflected that it was so brave and so helpful of someone like Sheryl to go give that feedback because there's a real cost to it. There's real risk to it.

Lenny (01:00:09):
Any other thoughts or advice along these lines that you want to leave people with?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:00:13):
The biggest piece of advice that I have that comes to mind is really around trying to be really thoughtful on something I call eating your vegetables. So I have all these branded terms for things, but-

Lenny (01:00:13):
That's great.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:00:30):
... eating your vegetables is really this idea around how little kids don't really develop an appreciation for vegetables until they're 10 or 12 exposures in. So the researchers say, "Expose kids to vegetables 10 or 12 times, even if they don't like it, because that's what it takes to get someone to like something." So when I think about career strategy and when I think about improving yourself and I think about how do we look for some of the hard feedback, eating your vegetables is this really important component of it because it's about how do you identify dislike for something because you're bad at it or you're new to it or you've never done it before, compared to genuine dislike where you've done it and you really don't like it. So to make it a little bit real, if we think about the world of podcasts, Lenny, I think it's something like 75 or 80% of podcasts never make it past the first podcast.

(01:01:25):
You have to do things a number of times before you really develop an affinity for it. Because the first time you do it, you're just not going to be good. So my mini example of that was early on in my career, I was really awkward and not very good at networking. I moved to Silicon Valley and one of the things that people told me about Silicon Valley was that it's really important to grow your network. It's all about the people. Totally agree about that. However, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't really understand this networking thing. So I gave myself this rule where I had to go out once a week for a couple of months, go to an external event, and I would count out 10 business cards. And the rule was, I had to hand out all 10 of those business cards by introducing myself to people that were new, and touch the back wall of the venue of that event and then I could leave.

(01:02:15):
I did that a couple of weeks in a row, and it was horrible. It was really awful, but it got a lot better. What I realized about that was actually two things. One that, as I started going and I saw familiar faces, it became a lot easier for me to just break in and meet people, just by seeing who people I knew already were talking to. And then second, I got a lot better at just breaking in and introducing myself and understanding how this intro and networking thing worked in terms of meeting people and moving through a crowd. Some of those relationships now from that first job and those first couple months are pretty much foundational to the network and the people that I know today. So it really paid off for me because I really focused on eating my vegetables and powering through that initial discomfort.

(01:03:00):
So to title back when it comes to thinking about how do you progress in your career, think about the obvious things that maybe you're not very good at, and then think about what are some of the actions that you can do to be very deliberate and intentional about practicing it to get to the point where you have some faculty at it because it's just really important in some cases to be good at certain skills.

Lenny (01:03:24):
I really like that. I also really like the physicality of that rule of touching the back wall. It just forces you to go through a room, and I just escape really quickly. Is there any other examples of things you've seen or recommend for doing things like, eating vegetables? That was a really good example of just forcing yourself to go to a networking event, touch the back wall. Is there anything else, any other examples that come to mind that you've recommended or found useful, doing something really hard that was really impactful?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:03:53):
Yeah. So there are actually a few of them. A lot of them around content creation because it's just so hard. So one of them that comes to mind is, I know a lot of people have talked about doing a LinkedIn 30. So 30 days of posting something on LinkedIn in terms of content every day for 30 days straight, and just getting past that barrier of sharing. And then looking at it over time and seeing out of the things that you posted, what really resonated. I also think it's helpful to start thinking about things like getting into DMs. Right. It takes a lot of work to think about, "Oh, this person's really smart, let me DM them. Let me try to strike up a conversation because we're well out of the world of physical business cards. I don't think anyone has those anymore.

Lenny (01:04:34):
No.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:04:35):
But modern networking is finding people that are really interesting on the internet and then finding some way to connect with them. It takes a certain amount of extroversion in that case to start meeting up with people and having conversations with them. So forcing yourself in some way to really think about, "Well, instead of having one outreach and then failing at it and saying, 'I'm never doing that again.' How do I actually create a pattern where I can learn or a sequence of trying to do this 10 or 12 times, and see what I get out of it?" Because that's really how you learn and how you grow.

Lenny (01:05:07):
The LinkedIn 30 idea, I like a lot. Something that I'll share as a tip is when you hear that, I bet a lot of people are just like, "Oh, my God. Going to link post on LinkedIn. So cringey. I don't want to be this self-promotiony LinkedIn person." But what I find is if you reframe it to, "I just want to crystallize a thought that I have and just share something that is useful to me or an insight I've had, and not think of it from, I'm trying to get as many likes. I'm trying to go viral with this post, or I'm trying to just build some following." Just don't think of it that way. Think of it as just want to communicate a thought I have and use this opportunity to crystallize it in a really simple way. That helps motivate. That, at least, works for me. It also ends up being useful for me. It's not like I'm trying to grow some following as a result of that.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:05:59):
I find that really helpful as well. One piece of advice that's similar to that that I've heard is, write for an audience of one. Imagine you're just talking to a friend or you're trying to talk to someone that's a trusted colleague, and just write for them. I think that's really helpful, and it helps us with the problem of getting in over your skis, really over fixating on the outcome of, I did a post and I didn't get my 5,000 followers. And instead, just thinking about I did a post because I wanted to share an interesting idea, and then how cool, some people resonated with it.

Lenny (01:06:31):
Yeah, I love that. You could just even say, something I found useful day one and just approach it that way. That's the stuff that end up being most interesting to people. The less it feels like you're trying to be thirsty for followers and likes and all that stuff. And the more it's just like, here's the thing I've found useful. Enjoy it, if you can.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:06:49):
Yeah. Yeah. People can really tell when you're being genuine and authentic online.

Lenny (01:06:53):
Absolutely. More and more. Maybe a last question. You started a company with your partner. You're both co-founders, you and your husband. I'm curious, what's your take on that approach to starting company? Would you recommend for other folks or not?f

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:07:10):
If you had asked me when I first started the company, it would've been an enthusiastic hell yes. I totally recommend. Now, I have a couple asterisks on top of it, and-

Lenny (01:07:10):
Go on.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:07:23):
... I think it really just goes back to what I was talking about earlier where being a founder is such a traumatic and crazy experience with all these intense highs and lows and lack of structure that when you throw romance into the mix, it's just this really volatile combination. So what I've found is that it seems like it either goes really well or it goes really badly, and there's no in between. And asterisks are there because we've actually had a couple of friends try it, and it's been such a mixed bag of results. So my personal experience is I love it. My partner Sachin, and I work really well together. And the main benefit that we have is that the active founding is such an active obsession that you spend so much of your time thinking about your business and the concepts of your business and whatever problem you happen to be facing.

(01:08:11):
That when I had this thesis of I want to be a founder too, we played it out and said, "Well, okay, now we're going to walk around being obsessed about two completely different things. We may never see each other, and so why not try the same thing?" So our first experiment was actually trying it together, and we were nuts. I actually had a 30, 60 and 90 day plan where we would have check-ins. And some of the explicit questions in the check-in, is this affecting our relationship? Because I just wanted to make sure we were putting our relationship first. It worked well for us to the extent that we've done two companies together. And then when we were at LinkedIn, we actually moved across multiple teams in the company and continued to be counterparts and product and marketing together. So it's been phenomenal. The thing that I would say really helps us in terms of making it a successful relationship was things that I think apply to anyone that's thinking about, should you work with a person and should you be a co-founder with this person?

(01:09:08):
We had a very, very good set of complimentary domains and skillsets, so we had really clear decision making rights. Sachin does product design and engineering. I focus on marketing, operations, finance, everything else on the business side. And because of that, it's really clear that we take input from each other, but ultimately who makes the call and who's driving and owning that project. So that was really helpful for us. And then the big part that I think is the murky Meyer for couples and maybe even for close friends working together is how do you engage in constructive conflict? How do you get to the point where you're attacking the problem and not each other? So if your partner comes to you and says that work was not good, that marketing plan or that product roadmap that you put together, not good, do you take it as the plan is not good and let's talk about what we can actually do to fix it?

(01:10:06):
Or do you take it as, "Oh, gosh, they think I'm not good. They think I'm too lazy. I saw that look that they were giving me." And take it as this personal offense. So the ability to be really truth seeking and take the most respectful interpretation when you're giving feedback to focus on trying to get to a smart good outcome that benefits the business, I think that's actually one of the most crucial things that you have to think about. If you're going to work with anyone. Much less your partner or a close friend on starting a company and what's really worked for us,

Lenny (01:10:37):
I am very impressed with how you're able to execute on this. I don't think I could do this with my wife. That would not go well, I think. You should probably write-

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:10:37):
That's self awareness.

Lenny (01:10:48):
Yeah. No, we're aware. You should write a post on how to successfully build a company with your partner. That seems like you have a lot of really interesting frameworks and insights on how it's worked. The fact that-

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:10:57):
That's a good idea.

Lenny (01:10:58):
... [inaudible 01:10:58] for so long. Yeah, it could be its own little book. Is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:06):
I think you covered most of it, Lenny.

Lenny (01:11:08):
With that then, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:15):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:11:17):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:20):
Persuasion by Robert Cialdini. I think it's a great book, if you're a marketer. It's a great book, if you're a founder or product person. But it really is a breakdown of what are the different strategies to get people to say yes and help persuade them toward things. I think it really helps in terms of thinking through that and designing a product or a business around it.

Lenny (01:11:40):
I've got that in my bookshelf behind me.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:11:43):
Oh, yeah. It's a great book. Yeah. The next book that I also recommend is a book called Designing Your Life, and it's out of the Stanford Design School. And it's by, let me look, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They're two Stanford D School professors, and what they're doing is they're applying design principles to life design. So how do you actually map that next level career that's both meaningful and fulfilling and also achieves maybe some of the success factors that you really care about, and brainstorm and be really creative about it. So when people are stuck or thinking about career strategy, that's actually one of the books that I always point out for them.

Lenny (01:12:23):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:12:25):
So Ted Lasso is back, so I'm watching that, the newest season. I am also a Star Trek nerd, so I'm watching Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.

Lenny (01:12:25):
I didn't know there's a new Star Trek. That's good to know.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:12:41):
Oh, It's so good. I think the thing I love about Star Trek is just that, unlike some of the classic storylines that you see right now on TV coming out now, sometimes the episodes are just happy. They explore a planet. Nothing bad happens. They see something really wondrous. They all leave happy, and they pat themselves on the back for having explored something. It's something that's missing in the genre of TV that they still have, this happiness factor where sometimes life is good and sometimes life is bad.

Lenny (01:13:09):
I like the sound of that. Although, I've learned about storytelling for a story to be interesting. There needs to be some conflict or problem. So I imagine there's something going wrong somewhere in the middle.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:13:20):
But it's not wrong. It's something interesting happens.

Lenny (01:13:23):
Oh.

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:13:23):
And then it's resolved, and it's happy. Right. But it just doesn't always need to be, something tries to kill you.

Lenny (01:13:28):
I got to watch that. That sounds great. I was a huge Star Trek fan back in the day. Didn't know they were still making new ones. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:13:37):
What's a common misconception people have about you? I usually like to throw that in toward the end of the interview, and the reason why I think it's really useful is it's a way for me to reset my bias. I may have had a certain impression about them, and this is their opportunity to speak up and say, "Hey, a lot of people think this about me, but it's not true." It's also this reflection of their self-awareness.

Lenny (01:14:01):
Great. What are some products that you've recently discovered or use regularly, SaaS products or even consumer fun random products that you want to share?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:14:14):
Yeah. I can't go through this podcast without giving a shout-out to Notejoy. So Notejoy is a fast and focused notes app for individuals and teams. So that's the company that I work on. So I use it for everything from Noora product roadmaps to my coaching notes, to even prepping for something like this podcast. I use Notejoy all the time. Another one that I really use a lot is Captio. It's been around for a while, but it's a little iOS app. I don't know if it's on Android, but basically it's a blank notepad. You can dump your brain into it, and there's one button, and it emails it to you. So when I find that I'm really distracted, or I just want to remember something, I use Captio all the time just to quickly capture my ideas. And then I process it later in my inbox.

(01:14:53):
And then something that I just downloaded this week is Arc, the new browser. I'm actually really excited about its vision. I'm not sure if I'm going to work it into my workflow yet or how it fits in, but it's really beautiful and it's really cool to see someone iterating on the cluster that is browser tabs.

Lenny (01:15:11):
Yep. Love Arc. Went deep on Arc in the previous episode and I used Captio, however you call it. And I found another app, actually, the similar thing that I found even more simple. It's called Note to Self, just sits on my doc. Anytime I want to email myself a thought, I open it up and this type of thing. Somehow, it ends up being even easier. So that's another one to check out, Note to Self. Final question. You're really big on productivity. What's one tip that you found that has been really helpful for you in your day-to-day life, being more productive?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:15:43):
Figure out, maybe the night before, the one thing that you want to get done in your day, and then at the earliest opportunity, just try to give yourself five minutes on it. Just five minutes. And the reason why I say five minutes is that there is this challenge that I experience and maybe other people experience as well, which is really just productive procrastination. Even though I know something is really important that needs to get done, I will often do other things that are useful and need to get done simply because I'm avoiding that one thing. And then before you know it's the end of the day and I'm like, "I still have to go do that thing." By really focusing on what's the number one thing and then just getting started on it a little bit. It just makes it really lightweight. And usually, what I find is that five minutes turns into a solid hour just knocking that thing out early in my day, and I feel really accomplished. But it's a mental hurdle that I really struggle with.

Lenny (01:16:37):
I really like the approach of the five minutes because that's such a trick to get you to like, "All right, I'll just do five minutes. I got to get this done."

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:16:44):
Right. It's quick.

Lenny (01:16:44):
I need to bring it. Yeah. There's a book that many people on this podcast have recommended called Make Time, and there's a framework within that called The Highlight, where you pick the highlight of your day, and that's the thing you got to do first and make... That's like, if you do nothing else, do your highlight and-

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:16:59):
Yeah, really similar then.

Lenny (01:17:01):
Yeah, and they don't do the five-minute thing, so I think that's a clever element of it. Ada, this was amazing. This chat was full of feelings, and frogs, and vegetables, and frameworks and insights. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Ada Chen Rekhi (01:17:21):
You can find me online. On Twitter and LinkedIn, I'm Ada Chen, A-D-A-C-H-E-N. I have a website, adachen.com, and you can always just shoot me an email, adachen@gmail.com. In terms of how listeners can be useful to me, any feedback and riffs on some of the ideas and topics that we've shared. I'm always eager to learn from other people.

# When to invest in new acquisition channels | Adam Grenier (Uber, MasterClass)

## Transcript

Adam Grenier (00:00:00):
One of the biggest pieces of advice I'm giving to people that are like, "How should we adjust our marketing with the economic changes and things like that?" I was like, "Start by assuming you no longer have product market fit, because you had product market fit in a different market." It's a different market now, so you have to start over. And hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things, and you could be right back on track. But if you just assume you need to launch a new channel to fix this problem, you're going to be wrong, because your entire customer base changed, not just the next 10% of customers that you're looking for.

Lenny (00:00:34):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Adam Grenier. Adam was head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber where he basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team from the ground up. Then he went on to VP of Product and Marketing at Lambda School, and most recently he was VP of Marketing at Masterclass. These days, Adam advises companies, large and small, on growth and marketing strategy.

Lenny (00:01:10):
In our conversation, we cover how to decide when to try new and emerging acquisition channels like TikTok, VR, newsletter ads, and how to go about testing them out. We get into the growth CMO role, which is an emerging role that Adam has helped pioneer, and we get into some real talk about burnout and depression and mental health issues that often come with working in tech. This was a really powerful and insightful conversation and I learned a lot from Adam both as an operator and as a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. And so with that, I bring you Adam Grenier.

Lenny (00:01:48):

Lenny (00:04:02):
Adam, welcome to the podcast.

Adam Grenier (00:04:04):
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:06):
It's my pleasure. I'm really excited to chat. So, I'm going to give a very brief overview of your very impressive career, and just let me know if I missed anything.

Adam Grenier (00:04:15):
All right.

Lenny (00:04:15):
Sound good?

Adam Grenier (00:04:15):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:04:17):
Okay, so you were most recently VP of Marketing at Masterclass, which I'm actually a happy subscriber of and I've watched many a video. Before that, you were VP of Product and Marketing at Lambda School. I don't know if that's right before, but that was something you did. Also, you were head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber, which is a really cool title. And I think you spent four years there and you basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team. And currently you're doing a bunch of advising and exploring to see what you want to do next. Is that about right?

Adam Grenier (00:04:50):
Yeah, you hit most of the key points. I think pre-Uber, the first chunk of my career was on the advertising side, so worked in agency world. So, I kind of think of this as phase three of my life. Ads world was phase one, startup and growth world phase two, and now really just spending time helping entrepreneurs and founders and built companies and that type of stuff.

Lenny (00:05:16):
What's been your favorite phase so far?

Adam Grenier (00:05:18):
I mean all of them. I just embrace what gets thrown at me and allow it to organically happen. So, each phase has had its pros and cons and ups and downs, and so I think they've all fit pretty well into where I was in my career.

Lenny (00:05:34):
Speaking of moving and adjusting and iterating, I know you're big into improv. How serious are you about improv?

Adam Grenier (00:05:44):
Good question. Serious in the sense that I've done it for a very long time and I still do it and I try to do it regularly. Serious as in am I aiming to make money off of it and have a career out of it? Unfortunately not. There was a point in my life that that is what I wanted to do. I lived in Chicago, did Second City ImprovOlympic, a variety of different places, did quite a bit of performing, but also got into corporate paychecks early as well.

Adam Grenier (00:06:12):
And so kind of built a lifestyle that made doing improv full time probably not the best path for me at the time. And so made a pretty conscious choice early on that it was more of a hobby and if something ever came of it, cool, but if not, that's okay. It's something I keep coming back to, because it's very grounding and fulfilling in ways that work and family life and things like that don't quite hit for me.

Lenny (00:06:34):
Actually at Airbnb we had an improv teacher come and work with the PM team. It was for months. We did improv games once a week.

Adam Grenier (00:06:42):
Nice.

Lenny (00:06:43):
And played all these fun things. And I'm curious what you've taken away from improv that has helped you become better at your work?

Adam Grenier (00:06:51):
So, I think generally the whole suite of skills that you develop in improv are pretty applicable, right? Because you are getting comfortable on your feet with change, with teamwork, building off of each other, experimenting, trying new things, a little bit of everything. I think a couple of the key rules or themes of improv that I really try to hammer home with people are obviously the "Yes, and..." side of improv, which everyone's probably heard, which is in a scene the worst thing you could do is deny somebody, because you're actually just stopping progress and you're not building off of anything.

Adam Grenier (00:07:27):
So, the appropriate approach is to say, "Yes, that is true, and..." and add to it. So, if someone's like, "Hey, you have a chicken on your head," not saying, "No, I don't." Just kind of ruins that scene. Versus saying, "Yes, I do, and it's name is Sally. What's your chicken's name?" Builds on that and gives it more opportunity. And so I think that in growth in business is super important to be able to say, "Yes, I do see your idea," or "Yes, we did accomplish this and this is what we want to do next and this is how it's going to build on it," I think is super important.

Adam Grenier (00:07:59):
The other one that I think is less known or talked about is the gift of details. So, in a scene, if you give somebody really specific details about something, it gives so much more meat to be able to work off of in terms of what's coming next. So, if someone's starting a scene and they're clearly watching television and clicking through the channels and I walk up and just say like, "Oh, you're watching TV, cool." That's a yes statement. I'm not denying what they did. But if I come up and say like, "Oh cool, you're watching TV. Is that an Alf episode? I haven't seen Alf since I was a kid. It reminds me this one time I actually ate my own cat."

Adam Grenier (00:08:39):
Just giving those specific details of Alf and me as a kid and I had a cat, which if people don't know Alf, he ate cats.

Lenny (00:08:48):
I don't remember that. I remember Alf, but I don't remember he ate cats.

Adam Grenier (00:08:51):
He was always trying to get the family cat. So, those kinds of details add a ton of value and you take that into the business world, to use Masterclass for instance, if I say, "Yeah, Masterclass, we've got this way to build content that is both entertainment and education," that's interesting. But if I say, "We create content that is both education and entertainment to solve people's deep curiosities in the way that maybe a biography would." That just opens up the exact problem that you're trying to solve. What are other alternatives to that problem? How are people consuming that? So, I think the gift of details in good improv and learning those skills is something that I really value and look for in every aspect of my business life as well.

Lenny (00:09:41):
It sounds like it's really helpful, one, in marketing, creativity and positioning, and things like that you just described. Have you found it also to be helpful in collaboration like this "Yes, and..." piece? I'm curious, is there an example or story where you like "Yes, and..." someone? Do you actually say "Yes, and..." in a meeting? How do you actually find that you use it?

Adam Grenier (00:09:58):
I hear it every now and then. I don't usually literally say it. I think one of the areas that I've found it to be valuable is when you've got cross-functional work. So, obviously at Uber we dealt with city teams a lot, and so a lot of the times the way that the central team would scope a problem versus a local team would scope a problem, would almost feel at odds with each other. And if you approach it with that "Yes, and...", it's often still true.

Adam Grenier (00:10:24):
It's like, oh, both of these things can be true at once. You could have a different goal than I have, or you have a system problem local to you that is important to you and it's not important to me. That's okay, both things can exist. So, now that we accept both and can work off of each other, we're more likely to build both a better rapport and energy among ourselves because we're not just saying, "No, no, no, no, you're wrong. That's not true, that's not important to the business. Why are you doing that?" That type of energy when cross-functional work, it just kills the scene, it kills that progress. And then you don't build relationships, you don't build the right solutions, all that type of stuff.

Lenny (00:11:06):
It sounds really good. Everyone in theory wants to be really good at this. And I imagine just doing a bunch of improv is a really good way to get better at not getting defensive and being like, "Yes. And how do we make this idea better?" Is there something you can advise folks to work on this skill, or is it just do a bunch of improv classes and it'll kind of help build that skill?

Adam Grenier (00:11:25):
That's one. I would say that I'll say that all the time to people, "Do some improv classes." And I get a lot of people like, "No, I'm not funny," or, "I don't want to do improv." And I think it's still a really great class to take, even if you have zero interest in doing improv, or public speaking, or any of that kind of stuff. Because, again, improv 101 is taught everywhere. Every city has it somewhere, and it's rarely ever people that are trying to do improv professionally. It's all games, like you said. The classes that you all did at Airbnb is what improv 101 is, right?

Adam Grenier (00:12:00):
It's just like, "Hey, let's just have fun. Let's just get out of our skin," and things like that. So, I do think everybody should take improv classes. I think it's also something with a lot of goals or skills that you want to develop, I think being really public and open about you wanting to develop that. So, if you are managing a team and you want to sharpen the skills, make it a team goal, or have accountability and just say, "Hey guys, I know that I've been pushing back on things lately. I want to really try to embrace and grow off of ideas better, hold me accountable, call me out and be like, 'Adam, "Yes, and..." this please."

Adam Grenier (00:12:32):
Or giving people permission to push back on that when it doesn't happen, I think also just opens the door for more productive conversations with people and the ability to hold yourself accountable and keep trying it.

Lenny (00:12:47):
I love that. And such a good team bonding activity. There's like all these reasons to do this as a team. My wife actually, she's a designer, artist, writer, illustrator kind of person, and she's been taking a lot of these sorts of classes to help inspire her creativity. She never wants to be an improv person, she did stand up classes.

Adam Grenier (00:13:03):
That's awesome.

Lenny (00:13:05):
As you said, it just helps you get the juices flowing along these lines. Okay, so we're not going to talk about improv the whole time.

Adam Grenier (00:13:13):
We could if you want to.

Lenny (00:13:15):
We could. Throw me word, let's go. No, we don't want to do that. So, there's basically three things I really wanted to chat about with you. One is how to decide when to invest in an emerging acquisition channel like TikTok, VR, Clubhouse was a big thing. You have some really interesting thoughts on how to decide and approach this thing. To the growth CMR role, which is kind of this, I think emerging role, something you're really good at, and I just want to get your thoughts on what's happening there. And then, three, some real talk on burnout and depression that often comes with working in tech and stuff that we go through. Does that sound good?

Adam Grenier (00:13:51):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:13:51):
Okay, great. So, to start with in the first topic, if you think about it just every company essentially goes through this kind of S-curve of growth. They start slow, they find something that's working, then hopefully it works out and things start to grow, grow, grow, and then eventually it flattens out and you see this S-curve that happens. And every company is always trying to find the next S-curve to add this layer on the cake that keeps overall growth up while this first growth channel slows.

Lenny (00:14:18):
And so people are always looking for what's the next thing? "Oh man, Clubhouse is coming out. We should get on Clubhouse." "Oh, TikTok is so hot, we've got to run some TikTok ads." And there's always something new, like newsletter ads, I don't know, podcast ads, if that's new. And you have a really interesting framework for how to think about this and make decisions and experiment. So, I'd love to hear insights there.

Adam Grenier (00:14:38):
So, the exploring emerging channels framework that I'll take, either my teams or companies that I'm advising through, has three core ingredients that I like to spend time with. So, the first is really understanding if there is an overlap between what the customers need is, what your company's goals are, and what the channel actually does really well. So, the example I've used in the past is Spotify in the moment of things like Clubhouse and Paparazzi and stuff like that becoming really popular.

Adam Grenier (00:15:14):
Well, for Spotify, they're trying to get more people to consume music and be entertained by music and things like that. And it's all audio driven. And so their growth goals are probably around new customers or deeper engagement with audio. The customer's needs are discovery and more ways to maybe have deeper relationships with their music. If you're a jazz fan, can you learn new jazz artists or more about the artists that you love? Things like that. And then take those two channels. If you take something like Clubhouse, it's audio first, it's almost like live podcast radio type feel to it.

Adam Grenier (00:15:57):
You can get into these rooms with just people with really amazing esoteric knowledge about something. And so its strengths have a really clean overlap to me with the goals of Spotify, the needs of the customer and the strengths of that. And so that to me is great. That is probably a green light in terms of is it even worth our time? Versus Paparazzi is very photo driven and nothing really to do with music or anything like that. And so it's like even though Paparazzi might have become the best biggest channel ever, is that the thing you should be putting your time into? It would be a yellow light for me at best.

Lenny (00:16:36):
And how did you describe that again? It's the medium matches?

Adam Grenier (00:16:40):
Yeah, the strengths of the medium. So, let's take influencer right now. Actually two of the channels that a lot of people are talking about right now are streaming TV or OTT and influencer marketing. And so to me, one of the strengths of influencer marketing is hyper targeted contextual marketing. And so I can go find the five influencers that are hardcore Alf fans, and if I'm marketing Alf something, great, I can go find that specific thing. Whereas OTTs a lot harder to get that specific.

Adam Grenier (00:17:16):
OTT strength is broad reach and video storytelling and that type of stuff. So, it's like, okay, well maybe my medium is if I'm Masterclass and I have a ton of video content and storytelling and things like that, that channel actually makes a ton of sense probably. So, it's like what are the strengths of that channel is something that... that is actually probably the piece I see people ignore the most, which is they just want to know if a channel is hot or not. And this gets especially hairy in this world of a lot of B2B doing more consumer-esque marketing. There's so many B2B companies that just don't apply to emerging consumer channels.

Adam Grenier (00:18:00):
And it's just like, please just stop. I don't need a Notion Clubhouse channel this week. And maybe there's a world to do that. But I think that's kind of number one, is making sure that there's even a reason that you should be there to put it on your radar right now.

Lenny (00:18:19):
Awesome. What does the OTT stand for by the way?

Adam Grenier (00:18:22):
Oh my gosh, you're putting it on the spot.

Lenny (00:18:24):
It's all good.

Adam Grenier (00:18:25):
I'm drawing a blank on it.

Lenny (00:18:26):
But essentially it's a streaming platform?

Adam Grenier (00:18:28):
Over the top. Over the top. So, instead of it being cable TV, it's coming from a box. So, it's primarily if you think of ads on Amazon or Hulu or even if you go to cnn.com and you start streaming and you get an ad first. it's basically video ads, but a lot of them now are happening on televisions and on streaming services rather than just on websites.

Lenny (00:18:55):
Got it. Okay, cool. So, the first is the strength of the channel. You should look at that.

Adam Grenier (00:18:59):
Yep. And how that overlaps with your customer and your business needs. The second is the channel DNA. And so this is looking at things like where are they in their trajectory? So, Clubhouse is actually a perfect example, because in a weird way, so Clubhouse got hot before Facebook got cold. And I was pretty amazed how many more people were trying to crack Clubhouse than TikTok, because TikTok hadn't really released their ads solution yet, but neither had Clubhouse. But everybody was talking about Clubhouse, and TikTok is very clearly not going away anytime soon, where Clubhouse hopefully won't. Like this is an amazing product.

Adam Grenier (00:19:41):
I really enjoyed it and loved it, but it was clearly very early, very quickly at that point of hotness where everyone was just kind of, "That's the reason I should be there." And part of this reason is to accept the risks of going into that channel. So, if I go and dedicate two quarters of work to Clubhouse, I need to accept that they are so early in this curve that there's a good chance this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it'll be over. It's not a repeatable action. It also is important because if you get something to work on a channel that's earlier in their growth curve, the likelihood that they will change is very high.

Adam Grenier (00:20:23):
You're going to need to commit a lot of cycles to keep it going, because it's like, "Okay, well, their product is going to evolve drastically very quickly over the next two years." And so a really great example is Facebook early... I was at Zoosk. And so Zoozk and companies like Zynga got tons of their early growth because of notifications on Facebook, which was one of their early features, which allowed basically anybody that took any action on Zynga, it would post on everybody else's page that you got 10 carrots, and that was a huge growth lever.

Adam Grenier (00:20:59):
But then Facebook just pulled the plug on that. And so it's like, well, if you put all of your energy into that and that's it, it was pretty clear that that was still an area that's like this may not last forever. The last thing on the channel DNA that I like to look at that's a little bit more, I don't know if odd or unusual is the right term, is I like to spend a lot of time thinking about how they monetize. What is the monetization strategy of the channel? And the reason is because if you, as a business, can match or support their monetization strategy, it actually gives you a really interesting leg up with that channel.

Adam Grenier (00:21:37):
Because the likelihood of you being able to call them up and go do custom stuff with them, or partner with them, or that your solutions will actually stick around for a while, it'd go up pretty drastically. And so my key example of this was with when Facebook started exploring mobile ads, Hotel Tonight, we were one of the alpha testers of mobile ads, because I'd been sitting here buying ad inventory on networks for the last five or six years and just waiting for Facebook to work, because it just wasn't really working for mobile installs.

Adam Grenier (00:22:13):
And it's like, I know this is a huge channel because I can use it on my online marketing, my web marketing, but as a mobile acquisition it's nowhere near as efficient as a lot of these other networks. And so as soon as they were doing that, I was able to basically position and say, "Look it, you want to work with us. Let me into your alpha, because I have five years of experience already buying mobile ads. I know the space. I know it'll work. And if you get us to work, we're a killer case study, because we are a non-game and a lot of money is spent on gaming, but there's these whole other major categories that you're going to need other than gaming examples within that group. So, you're going to be able to use me as a case study and a lot of different scenarios than the gaming players."

Adam Grenier (00:22:59):
And so I was spending a lot less than the gaming players, but because of that understanding that your goal at Facebook is to make ads work for all of travel and for all of leisure and those kinds of things, that's the value of working with me. So, that's another piece of the channel DNA I like people to focus on.

Lenny (00:23:18):
Awesome. That's such a good one, because to your point, if your goals are aligned, they're going to be like, "Yes, let's make this happen." And it always feels like it's this behemoth that doesn't want to talk to any new startups, but if you can make the case of this is going to help you and the way you laid out is so clear, it's such a good idea.

Adam Grenier (00:23:35):
And especially with emerging channels, right? Because their whole thing is that make this work for a long time. It's part of the challenge you see with some new channels flipping to the other side of growing an ads business, will gravitate towards like, "I want to get Disney on here," but Disney is very campaign driven, or they have been traditionally, where it's like you may get one big paycheck from them, but that doesn't... The way that UA driven gaming works is you get that to work, that's a gift that keeps on giving forever, right? Because there's not one of those companies, there's thousands of them and they all do the same thing. So, being able to drive that conversation is really helpful.

Lenny (00:24:18):
Cool.

Adam Grenier (00:24:18):
And then the third main ingredient is just your own company DNA. And so I think risk profile is a big one. Do you actually have comfort in being a first mover, a true first mover? Nobody knows anything, tracking's not going to work, it's not going to be programmatic. You're probably going to show up on content that's offensive. You're probably going to ask for refunds that won't happen. It's going to be really painful to be a true first mover. Do you have that appetite? Do you have the staff to actually be able to put someone on that and it not distract from everything else?

Adam Grenier (00:24:53):
And then the other piece on the company side is just your current channel mix. There's very few companies that I recommend saying, "Yes, go put energy on this brand new channel that you don't know how to scale yet before you've figured out some type of volume on Google and Facebook." Every now and then there may be a perfect fit where it's like, absolutely, you should be the person doing this. But if you're not at least getting something out of the basic channels that everybody else is using, it's probably not the thing you should be putting your first energy into. It should be like, "Great, I've got a good foundation." Like you said, now we're at that stage of trying to add things, tends to be a better stage to do more risky exploration into new channels.

Lenny (00:25:40):
What advice do you have or can you give to founders teams that are trying to test one of these in terms of just how to run these tests? How much time should they spend, would you say? What do they look for? I know that this is a hard question and super dependent on the situation, but any advice there?

Adam Grenier (00:25:55):
So, I think going through those three ingredients should help shape that answer, right? Because if you're like, "Okay, well, the first one is super strong, the channel DNA is maybe really early and I've got a small to mid-size team and maybe only one channel working," then it may be like, "Great. Put half of one person into this, because it's maybe interesting. But don't put any more than that into it." Versus if it's like, "Man, this is a killer fit the channel's a little further along and I have a 20 person team, so I'm going to put three dedicated people to this, because we are in prime position to be the leaders in this new channel and really push it."

Adam Grenier (00:26:36):
So, I think it's figuring those pieces out, because it is a very it depends answer, but rarely ever is it like, "Hey, this should be your entire team's focus for the next three sprints or five sprints." I think that if you've got that half person working on it for a while and there starts to be some magic happening, sure, put a sprint or two against it as a whole team. But generally speaking, I think keeping it minimum at first is my typical recommendation.

Lenny (00:27:06):
I had another guest, Yuri, who I think from former Grammarly, and he made a really good point that it's often better not to try something than to do it badly and then take away the wrong lessons. I guess, in your experience, what's a timeframe you think people should put into this stuff? You said two sprints, maybe a couple weeks. I don't know, what's the range of just maybe don't spend more than X months on something new if it's not clearly working, just based on your experience.

Adam Grenier (00:27:33):
Generally I wouldn't let anything bleed past a quarter. You can probably get some good signal in a month or less, what I would call fishing. It wouldn't be like you're just putting bait in the water to figure out where the fish are, not necessarily getting statistically significant repeatable solutions. The big variables that can change that timing, so if I'm exploring a new video channel, the content I need to create is if I'm going to have to create something that takes three weeks to produce and $20,000 to make, I may want to give it a little more time, because I gave it more of an upfront investment.

Adam Grenier (00:28:16):
Versus if it's like I want to put text ads in podcasts listings or something like that. It's like, great, I can do that by myself at midnight and it's not distracting anybody or anything. And if it doesn't work in three weeks, let's move on. But generally ideally what you're working through, and we'll touch a little bit more on this with the Growth CMO, is that this should all be part of a roadmap. It shouldn't just be randomly chosen and thrown at. This should be part of your sprint process and you should have a backlog of other things that you want to try. And so you're actually weighing that decision of how long based on what other opportunities you're missing out on by investing in that.

Adam Grenier (00:28:57):
But I would say most channels, especially new ones, are going to take more than a couple cycles to kind of suss out. Because there's no rules, there's no playbooks yet on how to do them well. So, give it a little bit of time, but if you're going over a quarter and you don't feel like directionally it's getting better or it's interesting, I would put it back on ice for a while.

Lenny (00:29:18):
Cool. And to your point, you're not going to see any statistically significant answers. Is the thing you look for just like you know it when you see it? Oh wow, qualitatively feels like it's working kind of thing? Is that what you kind of look for?

Adam Grenier (00:29:30):
Yeah, and I think define that going into it. What am I looking for, for this? So, something like Clubhouse I'm probably not going to see clicks. It's more about are we able to start a room and increase the size of that room by 10% every time that we run it? Okay great, that means that we're at least getting better at this and there's more reach available to us. But if we're getting 20 people every time we start a room and then it goes down to 15, then we're either not doing this well, the channel's not doing well, or there's just not enough reach for us to actually expand. Versus TikTok you might be able to say, "Great, I can actually track clicks and conversion, so let's look at it the way we would any other channel."

Lenny (00:30:11):
Got it. So, kind of look for momentum and that you're getting better and that it's moving somewhere. Awesome.

Adam Grenier (00:30:16):
Yeah. Yep.

Lenny (00:30:17):
Cool. So, a question that I'm sure is on many people's minds that they would want to ask is, Adam, what are emerging platforms that are interesting right now that we should experiment with? What do you feel?

Adam Grenier (00:30:28):
So, I mean I mentioned OTT, or basically the key thing with OTT is that it's way more trackable than traditional television, but it has similar value that traditional TV does in terms of the ability to do more long form storytelling type content, and a lot of it's not skippable if you buy it. And so those are reasons to be exploring that right now. It's hard for me to call that emerging channel, because it's been around forever. It's there's more of it and the tools and services around it are way better now than they were four years ago. And so I think the sophistication and ability to scale OTT is much higher now than ever before. Influencers probably the one that I'm most intrigued by, because similar to OTT, the scale and services and the ability to go do it is still there.

Adam Grenier (00:31:19):
It's also got that hyper granularity that when I get into influencer tools, it feels to me like early Facebook when I used to go be able to target Lenny, or 10 people that have exactly the same likes as Lenny. And that type of stuff where it's like you can get so specific and find exactly who you need. It's incredibly tedious and manual and it's a lot of relationship management. So, I'm also keeping an eye on the technology being built around influencer, because I think that's a huge area of opportunity for entrepreneurs right now.

Adam Grenier (00:31:57):
But generally speaking, the scope and opportunity there is huge and it's not going away, but it feels very new and different right now. And it supplements the ability to do some hyper level targeting that you've not been able to do, that Facebook and Google are getting less open about at the same time. I think VR is really interesting in the way that mobile was interesting before iPhone Three, where it was if you've got a VR app, it's a really interesting space, but if you don't, it's not that interesting to me yet. Any that have come up for you that you're like... what are your thoughts on this?

Lenny (00:32:35):
No, these are great. All I think of is TikTok.

Adam Grenier (00:32:38):
I feel like TikTok's crossed a chasm, whereas they actually have a formalized ad platform now, people are finding scale. There's still a ton to do there and influencers is also weird, because it crosses all of these other worlds as well. But I think TikTok is actually hyper interesting and everyone should be doing that. But I think of that less as you should be doing it as should I do it, should I not? And it's more I need to figure out how to do Facebook if I'm at least mildly appropriately should be there.

Adam Grenier (00:33:05):
The podcast ads I think are great. I think that I bought podcast ads 15 years ago, so it doesn't feel like an emerging channel to me. I think there's way more volume now than there's ever been before. One of the guys that was on my team at Uber has a company that's doing programmatic buying and that type of stuff. And so I think there's more opportunities on podcast. I think people want to treat it like Facebook ads or direct response ads, immediate response ads. And actually what I keep seeing as the effective strategy with podcast ads is treating them more like radio where it's more about getting on the right program, making it personal and feel like it should be part of that program, and then repeating over and over and over again.

Adam Grenier (00:33:53):
So, I think podcast is super interesting. I think it's just hard to scale. It's likely not going to get people the same volumes as the Googles and Facebooks of the world.

Lenny (00:34:01):
Cue our mid-roll ad. I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from Podcast sponsor, Amplitude. Hey John.

John Cutler (00:34:08):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (00:34:10):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (00:34:21):
Well, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So, the big aha was seen how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach and send data to other destinations. Experiment and CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (00:34:42):
And supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (00:34:46):
Yeah. So, Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.

Lenny (00:34:55):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started.

Adam Grenier (00:35:01):
I also come from a very consumer perspective. I'm actually stronger on B2B companies using podcasting, because it has that exact same value I just described, but each one of their customers is substantially more valuable. So, they don't need the scale that a consumer application or product would need.

Lenny (00:35:20):
Yep. That's exactly who I work with usually. One last question on this topic. What percentage of the time do you find that an emerging channel works? Is it like 20% of the time, 10%, 5%? What should people estimate, it's probably not going to work but when it does it's going to be game changing?

Adam Grenier (00:35:34):
Like 5% of the time. There's new things popping up all the time. I think the area that I think of as emerging that I've found more success in is taking things that exist already and make them... so the two slices of it are either it's existed for a long... like podcasting. So, it existed for a long time and now we're finally getting to a spot where it feels scalable. The other is existing channels that introduce something brand new.

Adam Grenier (00:36:04):
So, at the mobile ads I described on Facebook, pre mobile install ads and post. Those first 18 months of mobile install felt like an emerging channel, right? Because they were changing the product every week and tracking didn't work, and there were all these funky problems with it even though Facebook had been around forever. But brand spanking new channels, I don't know, they rarely work or are worth the effort early that you hope that they will be.

Lenny (00:36:35):
Cool. But when they work, it's game changing I imagine. Reminds me Apples coming out with Apple TV, I think it was, and they're just like, "Hey Airbnb, you should make it app for Apple TV. It'll be huge." And there's a team put on it. I don't know. They spent a month building this app and did a bunch of nothing as far as I understand, but it felt good. It felt good to be part of the launch. One question I wanted to come back to, are there tools that you recommend for influencer marketing that you want to plug, or point out?

Adam Grenier (00:37:01):
We were using Grin at Masterclass, we onboarded them. So, there's probably half a dozen companies in that same zone where they're building tools that allow you to do the discovery of influencers, the CRM of those influencers, and also often the measurement and payments and all that kind of stuff. So, it's an all in one type of management platform. That being said though, like I said, it's still super manual. It's nice to be able to go and find this list of 50 influencers that are the exact right influencer for this class launch, or whatever it might be.

Adam Grenier (00:37:34):
But it's still then I have to wait till they all respond to me and there's still a lot of manual back and forth. So, that's probably one of them. I'm trying to think of... There's a few other in that same category that are competitive with Grin that they all seem equally pretty good. I can't even remember the reason we chose Grin over some of the other ones.

Lenny (00:37:53):
It's a good name.

Adam Grenier (00:37:53):
It was all pretty close.

Lenny (00:37:55):
Sweet. Okay. If any other comes to mind, we'll throw it in the show notes. Before we get to the growth CMO discussion, there's kind of this tangential area that I wanted to spend a little time on, which is this idea of as a startup you initially should and often do start with a very narrow audience, your early adopters. I read this post about calling them your super specific who, and eventually you want to cross the chasm and go broader. And you have some interesting insights on how to think about that, and when to do that. Can you talk about that?

Adam Grenier (00:38:26):
Yeah. So, I think the book, Crossing the Chasm, is a great place to start in terms of thinking about the broader topic of that. What I see missed a lot of the time that I like to spend time with people on is to really understand that those early adopters are often just drastically different than the broad audience. And spending time to actually figure that out and map out what you need to see with those early adopters to have confidence that the product is actually going to have product market fit beyond them.

Adam Grenier (00:39:07):
So, I don't have anything hyper specific to add to that necessarily, or happy to dig in deeper to it, but it's probably the biggest challenge that I've seen with a lot of companies that I've worked with. And then as I do more investing and things like that, it's probably the biggest flag that I see with a lot of companies that claim to have product market fit, which is your TAM and your product market fit are not using the same definition. And that problem I think is often just a red flag for a lot of companies that I meet.

Lenny (00:39:40):
Got it. So, essentially you often underestimate how challenging it'll be to grow from your initial early adopter crowd. Is there an example of that happening where a company just got screwed because they didn't think about that enough? Or is there something someone can do early on? Is it test a little bit more broadly early? What do you recommend there?

Adam Grenier (00:39:59):
I mean Clubhouse might be a good example in the sense that they leaned into the broader audience maybe quicker than they should have. Their product market fit seemed to fit the moment in time and could they have built some experiments, or tools, or features that maybe stress tested will this work in an ongoing fashion? If they were on such tear, that's a pretty hard decision to make, I'm sure.

Lenny (00:40:29):
So hard, it's easy in hindsight.

Adam Grenier (00:40:33):
I think that's another piece of it is that the audience changes aren't always just literal people. Even right now, one of the biggest pieces of advice I'm giving to people that are like, "How should we adjust our marketing with the economic changes and things like that?" I was like, "Start by assuming you no longer have product market fit, because you had product market fit in a different market. It's a different market now, so you have to start over."

Adam Grenier (00:40:57):
And hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things and you can be right back on track. But if you just assume you need to launch a new channel to fix this problem, you're going to be wrong, because your entire customer base changed, not just the next 10% of customers that you're looking for.

Lenny (00:41:14):
It's just a reminder of how freaking hard startups are. Man, we have product market fit. Okay, we're done. Let's move on.

Adam Grenier (00:41:21):
Not anymore.

Lenny (00:41:21):
Not anymore. Oh man. Okay, sweet. So, onto this next topic around the Growth CMO. So, you're this really interesting combination of marketing brain and also very analytical growth person, and I think you refer to this as Growth CMO, which I don't actually hear the term much. So, I'm curious, what is a Growth CMO? How do you define it? And why is it important?

Adam Grenier (00:41:43):
Yeah, so it's something I've just spent a lot of the last few years thinking about, specifically because now I've been at a handful of companies where we've brought in CMOs that in all ways are absolute world class CMOs, and they don't last, they don't fit and they don't succeed. And so I've spent a lot of time and figuring, well, why not? Some of it coming because of spending time with those people being like, "Why are you doing it this way? That's not how a company at our stage operates."

Adam Grenier (00:42:18):
Trying to do it the way that a traditional CMO would've done marketing for a company, et cetera. One of the key examples I like to use is brand, in that everybody when they think about brand they think of it as an action, not as a consistent ongoing investment, or they think about it as campaigns and things like that. And from planning to execution to learnings, a traditional CMO will drive learnings and identify learnings. And in my mind, I think a Growth CMO is looking at each brand investment as how do you then immediately follow that up with the next one? How do you shift to this fast product iteration mindset with even things like brand?

Adam Grenier (00:42:58):
It's very possible, but it's so counter to a lot of traditional marketing DNA. That, to me, means that we have a lot of mismatch marketing leadership, and that quickly eliminates trust with the marketing organization. It means that we rename everything marketing to product led growth, or growth, or referral programs. To me, it actually dilutes the value of marketing should be playing in the company. And it doesn't mean that the traditional marketing CMO isn't a good fit for some companies.

Adam Grenier (00:43:37):
I think the direct to consumer products are still very well suited to have a more traditional CMO. But I think product driven companies, product led companies, if you are CMO and your product leader aren't married at the hip, you're just missing out on just tons of opportunity, and the likelihood of things actually working very well consistently and compounding on each other.

Lenny (00:44:05):
So, what are the attributes of this person of what you call a Growth CMO? Sounds like partly it's being much more performance driven. Sounds like a big part of it is understanding product and not creating these silos. We're going to market the thing, you guys go build this thing. But also as a person, that's a great CMO. What else do you look for?

Adam Grenier (00:44:22):
So, I would say so data driven generally. To me performance is a very loaded word in our world, because people think, especially in marketing, think that means not brand. But they're very data driven. And so when we take things like retention and even brand and the consideration funnel and, yes, you can't measure those exactly like you can measure landing page clicks and sales, but you absolutely can measure them. And making that part of the DNA of everything that's happening, data being part of that, I think is pretty quintessential of being a growth driven CMO.

Adam Grenier (00:45:00):
The second, I think, is the iteration process is not thinking about things and, "Hey, we need to plan for the next 24 months," but you can still do that and you can still have a vision and everything. But having that more of a agile type approach to everything. And again, this could be the storytelling that your sales people are doing, to what are your landing pages look like, to what is the design of your logo, to the brand itself. All of those things, like being more open to everything being possibly iterated on, on a regular basis using data to validate that and challenge what has worked for you.

Adam Grenier (00:45:38):
We live in such a real time world now, especially with product driven companies. The things change so quickly. If you as a marketing leader aren't being iterative and thoughtful about things with it, you'll get eaten alive. And then I think experimentation is just a huge piece of it. And something that I see a lot of more traditional marketing leaders, the idea of experimentation is try a new channel. It's not like how do we experiment with our brand? How do we experiment with the funnel? The whole picture, not just the top of the funnel or the external elements of it.

Adam Grenier (00:46:17):
One of the things that I haven't quite figured out the right language to put against this, but the traditional model of marketing is the four P's, product, placement, promotion, pricing. And in my mind, the world that we live in now, product is no longer a part of marketing, but it's actually they're married at the hip. They're one and the same, and most companies aren't operating that way. They're still operating as if they're two wildly different things. Even if they say they're working together, it's still, there's not. And to me it's just like, no, no, the product, it is the company now.

Adam Grenier (00:46:59):
And the marketing is integrated with literally every single piece of it. A lot of traditional marketing got established in the 1920s and the 1950s around products that took years to develop or try, or a product team was a science group trying new flavors of cereal. And so the marketing team owned the box, where it went on the shelf and what the price was and all of those kinds of things was marketing, because product was such a wildly different part of the organization. And I think still there's just a lot of fundamental things that marketers think about that are stuck in that world, because most haven't had to grow through the true growth of a business that's just being established today.

Lenny (00:47:53):
And the assumption is every software company should be hiring a CMO that is of this sort, of a Growth CMO, right?

Adam Grenier (00:48:01):
Yeah. And I would say that my sense is that there's very few marketing leaders that can't be a Growth CMO. So, I don't think you have to have come up as a performance driven experimentation. It's more about adapting and growing. And again, the fundamentals are all the same. One of my pet projects that I haven't done anything with yet, is that every time something new comes out in the growth world, I go back in history as far as I can to try to find the earliest example of that. Just to be able to say, "Look, this isn't new, but we can learn from the way that Coca-Cola invented the coupon."

Adam Grenier (00:48:37):
The first known coupon was Coca-Cola giving away Coke for free, but it was actually a marketplace, because what they would do is they would go to a town and they would go to the soda fountain and they would give a free Coke syrup to that side of the market and they would give coupons to the other side of the market to spark it, to get it going. And then it's like, well, now all the customers want Coke, now you need to supply it, you'll pay for it. And learning that and understanding that is really cool. And it's just interesting to me, because I'm a huge nerd.

Adam Grenier (00:49:09):
But that to me is all of the things that great marketing leaders have learned are right, it's the operating aspect of those insights and those skills and understanding your customer and their psychology. All of those things have stayed the same. It's the operating of it in the way a growth organization, like a product driven growth organization operates, is very fundamentally different than the way a traditional marketing run organization had run.

Lenny (00:49:37):
I was going to ask you what a marketing leader can do to evolve into this where you think things are going, and your point about you're capable of it, you can iterate and adapt is really great and empowering. Is there anything specific they can do to learn how to do this better, other than is it like mentorship? Is there classes, courses? Just do the job, figure it out? Do you have anything you can suggest there to folks listening and they're like, "Oh, shit. I'm in trouble?"

Adam Grenier (00:50:02):
Honestly, I think learn product development. Go learn agile product development. And there's actually a book called Hacking Marketing, I think. I'll confirm. But it's essentially how to run a marketing team on Agile. That to me is just, again, any great marketing leader should be able to go and consume how to do product development, how to run a product like sprints and those types of things. And their mind, if they're great marketing CMO or a CMO, will be like, "Oh my gosh, I could do this with this big event that we want to host. I could do this with everything."

Adam Grenier (00:50:43):
There's nothing off the table when you actually learn those fundamentals. But as well as I know smart people can learn that stuff. There's lots of resources out there. Reforge has some classes on it, there's a bunch of new product led growth classes out in the wild, like Maven I think has a couple. And there's a variety of those types of things that just going and doing it, you don't have to go and operate it yourself. You don't have to go become a product manager. But understanding those skills and those systems will, one, I think make you think differently about how to run your marketing team and, two, make you exponentially better at working with your product organization.

Lenny (00:51:21):
Awesome. I'm actually hearing from folks listening to this podcast not live right now, but broadly, that this is a good way to learn how product works and how product leaders think. So, that's interesting. So, if you're listening to this, good job. You also mentioned that a lot of marketing leaders don't work out at a company, they join, they leave, things go wrong. As a hiring founder or leader, what do you look for to tell you this person's probably not what we need and not what you'd call a Growth CMO? What are flags that are like they're probably not going to adapt and evolve to the way we want to operate?

Adam Grenier (00:51:53):
So, I think first and foremost, it obviously depends on the stage. Anything let's say C or below, comfortable with chaos and willingness to go do something they have not done for probably 15 years are two huge signals for me, because every company I've been part of at every scale now, which is all of them basically, that's the thing that a lot of people coming from more traditional marketing environments into startup worlds, it's a pace and just the unpredictability and change and those kinds of things are just at such a higher rate than they've seen for a long time that it can be really jarring for people.

Adam Grenier (00:52:49):
And I think it's totally reasonable. It's crazy, right? If anybody that's had the exposure on both sides. And then the willingness to go do the work. People are churning constantly and the challenges are different every week and those types of things. And so it's like every now and then you've got to go write an email or you've got to go open up Facebook and get into the weeds with it with your team, into the data of it and that type of stuff. And that's stuff that I don't want to do, personally, me. I'm past the point where I should be in Facebook.

Adam Grenier (00:53:17):
But man, when I need to, I'm willing to, and I'll go get in the weeds with it and I'll use my time to just be like, "Look, we have to figure this out now." And I'm going to go do the things that I thought I was done with in my career. So, those are pretty big ones. I think then generally speaking, one of the exercises I like to take founders through when they're hiring a marketing leader is every marketer is going to have a T-shaped career.

Adam Grenier (00:53:41):
Everybody came from something they probably became awesome at and then over time just expanded their purview. So, for me it was mobile. I got into mobile. My first client ever was on Sun Microsystems early 2000s, getting Java developers to make apps for flip phones. So, I just knew digital mobile world really, really well before a lot of people did. But then eventually I'm like, "Great, now I'm running an entire digital marketing team. Now I'm running an entire marketing team. Now I'm getting into growth. Now I want to learn product," and I've expanded. And so typically it's going through that exercise of find out their T, find out their strength, and then spend time figuring out how they make up for those other things.

Adam Grenier (00:54:24):
So, for me, at Lambda school I ran our PR team for a while. I am not a PR person, but I make it a goal in my life to get to the valley of despair of the Dunning-Kruger effect, to be like, "Great, I just need to know how bad I am at PR," because if I still think I'm good at it, that's not a good place for me to be. But once I know how bad it is, I now know I need to go hire the right person to come in and I'm going to listen to them. I'm not going to assume that I'm smarter than them, and those types of things. And so I think the same thing with product questions and data questions and experimentation questions for this concept of a Growth CMO is like, well, somebody's coming from a world where they've not had to work really closely with the product team, spend time with them to figure out how they plan on adapting to that.

Adam Grenier (00:55:12):
My guess is most won't have thought of that. The good ones will be able to figure it out together with you in that interview, or afterwards, or whatever it might be.

Lenny (00:55:22):
Awesome. Maybe one day we'll do a follow-up chat just to dive into hiring a marketing person. I know that's a whole deep topic.

Adam Grenier (00:55:31):
Lots of thoughts.

Lenny (00:55:31):
Okay. Oh man. Okay. We've got to book that. But, okay. So, you mentioned the valley of despair, and that's a good segue to our next topic. So, I found this old tweet of yours where you talk about burnout and depression, and you kind of make this point that a lot of times you feel like it's burnout and it's actually depression. And just broadly mental health is just this topic that's not really spoken a lot about in tech and in business. And so I'd love to just spend a little time on this. I know you're a big proponent of talking about these sorts of things, so I'm curious, I know you've been through both these things and I'm curious just to hear your journey, what that's been like, and what you've learned about how to get through it?

Adam Grenier (00:56:08):
So, the two biggest inputs for me in terms of really taking the time to understand my mental health, one is my wife, who's been a very strong proponent of mental health resources for everybody since I met her. And so just being able to learn from her and get exposure to, well, why is this important? What are the values of it? And seeing it pretty regularly of family members, or coworkers. Or it's like, oh man, I bet there's something deeper here that maybe is important for them to figure out.

Lenny (00:56:46):
Is that just something she's good at, or is she trained in this stuff?

Adam Grenier (00:56:49):
No, she's good at it and she's in therapy and stuff like that. She's one of the most empathetic, passionate people I've ever met in my life. And so she just feels like poor people so much that I think it's something really important to her. And then at Uber, I got to a spot where I was incredibly exhausted and tired and just down, not excited about work and things like that, and so I started going to therapy and with this assumption that I was just working too hard.

Adam Grenier (00:57:20):
That was kind of my like, "Man, I need to go to therapy to figure out the tools that I need to deal with me working too hard." And I just uncovered so many interesting things that I wouldn't have expected. So, one was that I'm the youngest child in my family and I did something pretty different than a lot of my relatives and things like that. So, recognition is something I long for, and it turns out I get that at work and I just hadn't gotten that in other parts of my life. And so this thing that I'm like, "This is my problem," was actually a solution to my real problem.

Adam Grenier (00:57:58):
And knowing that just helped me totally just change my perspective of how hard I work. I was getting judgemental about myself around, "Man, I'm working too hard. I shouldn't be doing this, but I have to." And then I got in the spot where I'm like, "Oh, I'm working hard because I love it, because I like it, I'm having an impact and I'm working with people I like and people respect the work that I do." And that helped me identify that I can work just as hard, but I can work smarter. I can work more on the things I have impact on.

Adam Grenier (00:58:30):
I can work more with people that actually respected the type of work that I'm doing. And that actually just started to relax me and get me to the spot of, "Oh, okay," I still some burnout in there, and that's part of the innovation. Part of my title was that I got to a spot where I'm like, I was traveling constantly, I had teams all over the world and the structure of Uber was working where every city had a GM and I was the person they called when their spend was too high. And so 500 GMs-

Lenny (00:59:05):
Uber GMs especially.

Adam Grenier (00:59:06):
Yeah, exactly. And so I was working in a world where I was dealing with a lot of politics. I love mentoring people, and I had this massive team of 150 people that I barely know any of them. And so I'm not mentoring people either anymore. And I just felt like I'm working so hard on things that I actually don't enjoy. And so I'm like, I'm going to go work on flying cars, which is a whole other podcast too. So, that was my, okay, there was burnout in there.

Adam Grenier (00:59:33):
I know that was a fact, but some of those feelings or things that I felt my entire life that I uncovered that I thought was just burnt out, I was like, "Oh, actually at this point in my life, this point in my life and this point in my life, I felt this way too. And at those points I wasn't burnt out. And so I actually have deeper work to do here and deeper understanding of myself so that I can actually maximize my life and enjoy it." And because I'm going to keep working to some degree this hard. And I want to just make the most of that.

Lenny (01:00:03):
I don't know if you mentioned this, but I imagine parts of those points were depression, not burnout. What have you found to be that line of just like, "Oh wow, this is a lot more serious than I'm just working way too hard?"

Adam Grenier (01:00:14):
For me, it's hard to describe, but I personally now can pretty cleanly tell the difference between exhaustion and depression. And it tends to tie to my broader motivations, not just my motivation to work. So, when I'm exhausted, I'll still show up to work, I'll still execute, I'll still do those types of things, but I'm going to go and if I can take an improv class, it's going to be a blast. I'm going to enjoy it and I'm going to love it. If I'm depressed, I won't go to that improv class. I'll just cancel it. I won't go to it. Or if I go to it, I'll go home immediately. One of the things I love about actual improv classes, is the community. Is, "Hey, let's all go grab a drink now." And this is a totally different group of people. It's not my family, it's not my work people, it's just me.

Adam Grenier (01:01:17):
And I wouldn't do that. And so it's kind of noticing where else is this impacting and to what degree and why, can help me understand what's going on in my life. Because more often than not, I can then take those feelings and it'll be like, "Oh, I've felt this way for three weeks now. I should think about this and dissect it a little bit." And so again, I'll spend time with my therapist. One of the tools that my therapist has given me is to open up with my friends and have these conversations with my friends. And so now I went from five, six years ago really just having my therapist or my wife to talk about this kind of stuff to, I don't know, I have five or six different friends that we're massively transparent with each other about this stuff, because the second I shared any of this with them, they shared it with me.

Adam Grenier (01:02:06):
And now we've become safe places to have those conversations where I can be like, "Hey, there's this thing going on." My dad has ALS and so he's been really sick and I've got three kids and I've got jobs and work and money and the market crash. And there's so many different things. It's like, okay, let me actually figure out which one of these things is causing this energy right now. And having many years of therapy now and those resources can help me get to that solution to get to that answer so that I can figure out, okay, what do I need to do right now? Do I need to actually take time for myself and dig deeper into these personal things? Do I actually need to change something with the shape of my career? Those types of things.

Lenny (01:02:47):
Awesome. And it sounds like the things that have been most helpful, and I'm curious what else you'd recommend to folks that are maybe feeling some of this. So, it sounds like therapy is really powerful, your partner and being open to your partner, finding a group of friends where you could be transparent about these sorts of things. Is there anything else you suggest folks look into?

Adam Grenier (01:03:04):
Yeah. So, I think meditation's a good one. The startup people love to talk about meditation, and so you can find lots of ways to do that. It's kind of evolved for me. So, it's in that tweet thread and I can't remember it now. There was a meditation thing that was the first, it almost felt like Noom for me for meditation where it wasn't just-

Lenny (01:03:24):
Waking Up, Sam Harris's-

Adam Grenier (01:03:25):
Yeah, Waking Up where it's like I'm actually learning about meditation, not just learning how to meditate. And that's how my brain likes to do things. I'm a lifetime learner, I love digging into things. I learned breathing techniques and things like that, but going through that program of Waking Up was the first time I actually really appreciated when and how and where to do it. I'm still not a everyday meditate person.

Adam Grenier (01:03:50):
I now use, I'm an investor, so I'm biased, but Aura, A-U-R-A, which is a marketplace app. It's some of the other meditation apps, but it's a marketplace, so it's actually coaches and stuff adding content. So, I use that now as needed, which I really enjoy. The exercise and diet and those types of things definitely tie to it. It's like eating is a pretty clean signal for me, or snacking is a really clean signal, at least for me of like, okay, I'm snacking more than I should be, and eating healthy can both help me identify that I'm in those spots, but also just make me feel better.

Adam Grenier (01:04:29):
One thing I would say is that the therapist that I found, I found through a service that we had at Uber, and I think I was surprised how much stuff is covered by companies in terms of the ability to find a therapist, pay for a therapist or other tools. And so that's one thing I would suggest, go look through your benefits. Your healthcare provider offers a lot of that stuff too. So, those are a handful of. Listen to Lenny's podcast?

Lenny (01:04:58):
I hope that to be true. I don't know if that's anywhere near as powerful as these other things. One thing I'll mention is on the meditation front, there's this amazing book that kind of does exactly what you also describe where it teaches you why this works. It's called, it's kind of like a bad title, it's called Why Buddhism is True. And it's not trying to convince you to be a Buddhist, but it has a lot of incredible insights on why meditation is so powerful and how to think about it. So, I'll put that in the show notes too.

Adam Grenier (01:05:24):
Awesome.

Lenny (01:05:24):
Yeah.

Adam Grenier (01:05:24):
I'm going to check that out.

Lenny (01:05:25):
I wanted to come back to the burnout piece. I imagine some folks are listening to this and they're like, "Am I burnt out? I don't know." What are signs that you're burnt out versus just working a lot and tired?

Adam Grenier (01:05:37):
The one that I see the most is adaptability goes down really fast. And this is more me noticing I've managed a lot of people and coached a lot of people, so when I see that from people that I'm working with, I usually immediately bring up, I'm like, "Look, your openness to change in the business, or trying new things, or going back and trying things that maybe we tried before and didn't work has shifted from, 'Oh, here are the flags that we should be aware of, but let's give it a shot' to 'Why are we wasting our time? Let's not do this.'"

Adam Grenier (01:06:12):
This energy around, let's just do the thing we're supposed to do. And I think that's maybe specifically applicable to our environment, to high growth and marketing and product where it's just, that's just a key ingredient to doing this job well, is adaptability and flexibility and exploration. And if you're losing that, it's probably not because you've gotten bad at it, right? It's probably because you're just over it, right? Where you're like, "I just don't want to deal with the BS around this. I want to go do the thing that makes my job easier."

Adam Grenier (01:06:46):
Which again, most of the people that have chosen this career path want their jobs to be harder, because it's more fun, it's more interesting, it's more rewarding. And so when you're looking for ways to minimize the challenge or the opportunity, I think that's a pretty good signal that they may be more burnt out than just exhaustion. Because if anything, I see the opposite for people that are exhausted, where they get re-motivated by new stuff, by opportunities to go do something different and that kind of stuff.

Lenny (01:07:15):
Wow. Really good insight. Second to last question, I know you have to run, where are you on this journey today and then just what's next for Adam Grenier?

Adam Grenier (01:07:24):
Yeah, thank you. Good question. I'm constantly optimizing this matrix of what am I good at versus what do I love doing? And so what I've found is that I really love entrepreneurs and working really closely with entrepreneurs and helping them figure out all of these funky things that I've been able to see over the last 20 years and maneuver. And I've worked at a lot of places and so I'm really good at context changing and helping connect the dots for people.

Adam Grenier (01:07:52):
And so a couple ways I've found to be able to do that is advising companies, so working with founders and growth leaders and things like that and investing. And so I'm actually right now, I've been investing now for six, seven years. I've recently joined Andreessen's Scout fund, so I'm doing a bit more volume now. But I would say if I had to make a bet right now, I think a full-time or closer to full-time investing world is what I'd like to lean more towards. But I'm very much a let's just open up opportunities, and once the right one is in front of me, I'm going to tackle it.

Adam Grenier (01:08:23):
And so who knows, I may go back full time somewhere or whatnot. But right now the advising, investing, coaching kind of hybrid is the term, I think it was Behzod at Reforge used, was me as a service is my current world. But I'd be shocked if I eventually don't gravitate towards some kind of foundation, because I thrive when I've got a little bit of an anchor.

Lenny (01:08:46):
Amazing. A mass, me as a service.

Adam Grenier (01:08:49):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:08:49):
Okay. For folks that may want to reach out to you about taking your money in their startup, or asking whatever questions, maybe advising questions, where can folks reach you and learn more?

Adam Grenier (01:09:00):
Just Twitter, AKGrenier and LinkedIn as well, it's AKGrier. So, look me up, connect. I'm always open to connecting and chatting with people and I just love digging into problems. So, happy to abide.

Lenny (01:09:13):
Amazing. Adam, this was such an action packed chat, so many levels and layers. I can't wait for folks to listen to this. Thank you so much for joining me and being here.

Adam Grenier (01:09:21):
Yeah, thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:09:22):
My pleasure. Thanks man.

Adam Grenier (01:09:24):
Good stuff. Take care.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You lead work on Codex.

Alexander Embiricos (00:00:01):
Codex is OpenAI's coding agent. We think of Codex as just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. It's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack, doesn't check Datadog unless you ask it to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
I remember Karpathy tweeted the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it.

Alexander Embiricos (00:00:21):
Starting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex be on call for its own training. Codex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training run, the key infrastructure. So we have a Codex code review that's catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually caught some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. One of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, the Sora Android app, like a fully new app, we built it in 18 days and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to the public.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
How do you think you win in this space?

Alexander Embiricos (00:00:47):
One of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity. If we're going to build a super system, has to be able to do things. One of the learnings over the past year is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer. It turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. And so we're kind of getting to this idea where if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
When you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks.

Alexander Embiricos (00:01:10):
A few of us are constantly on Reddit. There's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints. What we can do is as a product team just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):
Being at OpenAI, I can't not ask about how far you think we are from AGI.

Alexander Embiricos (00:01:28):
The current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Today, my guest is Alexander Embiricos, product lead for Codex, OpenAI's incredibly popular and powerful coding agent. In the words of Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT and former podcast guest, "Alex is one of my all time favorite humans I've ever worked with, and bringing him and his company into OpenAI ended up being one of the best decisions we've ever made." Similarly, Kevin Weil, OpenAI's CPO, said, "Alex is simply the best."

(00:01:59):
In our conversation, we chat about what it's truly like to build product at OpenAI, how Codex allowed the Sora team to ship the Sora app, which became the number one app in the app store in under one month. Also, the 20x growth Codex is seeing right now and what they did to make it so good at coding, why his team is now focused on making it easier to review code, not just write code, his AGI timelines, his thoughts on when AI agents will actually be really useful, and so much more. A huge thank you to Ed Bayes, Nick Turley, and Dennis Yang for suggesting topics for this conversation.

(00:05:14):
Alexander, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Alexander Embiricos (00:05:18):
Thank you so much. I've been following for ages and I'm excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):
I'm even more excited. I really appreciate that. I want to start with your time at OpenAI. So you joined OpenAI about a year ago. Before that, you had your own startup for about five years. Before that, you were a product manager at Dropbox. I imagine OpenAI is very different from every other place you've worked. Let me just ask you this, what is most different about how OpenAI operates and what's something that you've learned there that you think you're going to take with you wherever you go, assuming you ever leave?

Alexander Embiricos (00:05:49):
By far, I would say the speed and ambition of working at OpenAI are just dramatically more than what I can imagine. And I guess it's kind of an embarrassing thing to say because everyone who's a startup founder thinks like, "Oh yeah, my startup moves super fast and the talent bar is super high and we're super ambitious." But I have to say, working in OpenAI just made me reimagine what that even means.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):
We hear this a lot about feels like every AI company is just like, "Oh my God, I can't believe how fast they're moving." Is there an example of just like, "Wow, that wouldn't have happened this quickly anywhere else"?

Alexander Embiricos (00:06:20):
The most obvious thing that comes to mind is just the explosive growth of Codex itself. I think it's a while since we bumped our external number, but it's like the 10x-ing of Codex's scale was just super fast in a matter of months and it's well more since then. And once you've lived through that, or at least speaking for myself, having lived through that now, I feel like anytime I'm going to spend my time on building tech product, there's that speed and scale that I now need to meet.

(00:06:52):
If I think of what I was doing in my startup, it moved way slower and there's always this balance with startups of how much do you commit to an idea that you have versus find out that it's not working and then pivot. But I think one thing I've realized at OpenAI is the amount of impact that we can have and, in fact, need to have to do a good job is so high that I have to be way more ruthless with how I spend my time now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:15):
Before we get to Codex, is there a way that they've structured the org or, I don't know, the way that OpenAI operates that allows the team to move this quickly? Because everyone wants to move super fast. I imagine there's a structural approach to allowing this to happen.

Alexander Embiricos (00:07:29):
I mean, so one thing is just the technology that we're building with has just transformed so many things from both how we build, but also what kinds of things we can enable for users. And we spend most of our time talking about the sort of improvements within the foundation models, but I believe that even if we had no more progress today with models, which is absolutely not the case, but even if we had no more progress, we are way behind on product. There's so much more product to build. So I think just the moment is ripe, if that makes sense.

(00:08:01):
But I think there's a lot of counterintuitive things that surprised me when I arrived as far as how things are structured. One example that comes to mind is when I was working on my startup and before that, when I was at Dropbox, it was very important, especially as a PM to always rally the ship and it was like make sure you're pointed in the right direction and then you can accelerate in that direction. But here, I think because we don't exactly know what capabilities will even come up soon and we don't know what's going to work technically, and then we also don't know what's going to land even if it works technically, it's much more important for us to be very humble and learn a lot more empirically and just try things quickly. And the org is set up in that way to be incredibly bottoms up.

(00:08:45):
This is, again, one of those things that, as you were saying, everyone wants to move fast. I think everyone likes to say that they're bottoms up, or at least a lot of people do, but OpenAI is truly, truly bottoms up. And that's been a learning experience for me that now it'll be interesting if I ever work at... I don't think it'll even make sense to work at a non-AI company in the future. I don't even know what that means. But if I were to imagine it or go back in time, I think I would run things totally new.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):
What I'm hearing is this ready, fire, aim is the approach more than ready, aim, fire. And there's something, and as you process that, because that may not come across well, but I actually have heard this a lot at AI companies is because you don't know, and Nick Turley shared I think the same sentiment, because you don't know how people will use it it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time making it perfect. It's better to just get it out there in a primordial way, see how people use it, and then go big on that use case.

Alexander Embiricos (00:09:39):
Yeah. Okay, to use this analogy a little bit, I feel like there is an aim component, but the aim component is much fuzzier. It's kind of like, roughly what do we think can happen? Someone I've learned a ton from working here is a research lead, and he likes to say that at OpenAI, we can have really good conversations about something that's a year plus from now, and there's a lot of ambiguity in what will happen, but that's a right sort of timeline. And then we can have really good conversations about what's happening in low months or weeks. But there's this awkward middle ground, which was as you start approaching a year, but you're not at a year where it's very difficult to reason about, right?

(00:10:18):
And so as far as aiming, I think we want to know, "Okay, what are some of the futures that we're trying to build towards?" And a lot of the problems we're dealing with in AI, such as alignment are problems you need to be thinking out really far out into the future. So we're kind of aiming fuzzily there, but when it comes down to the more tactically like, "Oh yeah, what product will we build and therefore how will people use that product?" That's the place where we're much more like, "Let's find out empirically."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:41):
That's a good way of putting it. Something else that when people hear this, people sometimes hear companies like yours saying, "Okay, we're going to be bottoms up. We're going to try a bunch of stuff. We're not going to have exactly a plan of where it's going in the next few months." The key is you all hire the best people in the world. And so that feels like a really key ingredient in order to be this successful at bottoms up work.

Alexander Embiricos (00:11:02):
It just super resonates with me. I was just, again, surprised or even shocked when I arrived at the level of individual drive and autonomy that everyone here has. So I think the way that OpenAI runs, you can't read this or listen to a podcast and be like, "I'm just going to deploy this to my company." Maybe this is a harsh thing to say, but I think very few companies have the talent caliber to be able to do that. So it might need to be adjusted if you were going to implement this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):
Okay. So let's talk Codex. You lead work on Codex. How's Codex going? What numbers can you share? Is there anything you can share there? Also, just not everyone knows exactly what Codex is, explain what Codex is.

Alexander Embiricos (00:11:45):
Totally, yeah. So I had the very lucky job of living in the future and leading products on Codex. And Codex is OpenAI's coding agent. So super concretely, that means it's an IDE extension, a VS code extension that you can install or a terminal tool that you can install. And when you do so, you can then basically pair with Codex to answer questions about code, write code, run tests, execute code, and do a bunch of the work in that thick middle section of the software development lifecycle, which is all about writing code that you're going to get into production.

(00:12:21):
More broadly, we think of Codex as what it currently is just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. So when we use a big word like teammate, some of the things we're imagining are that it's not only able to write code, but actually it participates early on in the ideation and planning phases of writing software and then further downstream in terms of validation, deploying and maintaining code.

(00:12:46):
To make that a little more fun, one thing I like to imagine is if you think of what Codex is today, it's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack and doesn't check Datadog or Century unless you ask it to. And so no matter how smart it is, how much are you going to trust it to write code without you also working with it? So that's how people use it mostly today is they pair with it. But we want to get to the point where it can work just like a new intern that you hire, you don't only ask them to write code, but you ask them to participate across the cycle. So you know that even if they don't get something right the first try, they're eventually going to be able to iterate their rate there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:21):
I thought the point about not reading Slack and Datadog was it's just not distracted, it's just constantly focused and is always in flow. But I get what you're saying there is it doesn't have all the context on everything that's going on.

Alexander Embiricos (00:13:31):
Yeah. And that's not only true when it's performing a task, but again, if you think of the best team and teammates, you don't tell them what to do. Maybe when you first hire them, you have a couple meetings and you're like, "Hey," you learn, "Okay, these prompts work for this teammate, these prompts don't. This is how to communicate with this person." Then eventually you give them some starter tasks, you delegate a few tasks. But then eventually you just say like, "Hey, great. Okay, you're working with this set of people in this area of the code base. Feel free to work with other people on other parts of the code base too, even. And yeah, you tell me what you think makes sense to be done." And so we think of this as proactivity and one of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity.

(00:14:09):
I think this is critically important to achieve the mission of OpenAI, which is to deliver the benefits of AGI to all humanity. I like to joke today that AI products, and it's a half joke, they're actually really hard to use because you have to be very thoughtful about when it could help you. And if you're not prompting a model to help you, it's probably not helping you at that time. And if you think of how many times the average user is prompting AI today, it's probably tens of times. But if you think of how many times people could actually get benefit from a really intelligent entity, it's thousands of times per day. And so a large part of our goal with Codex is to figure out what is the shape of an actual teammate agent that is helpful by default.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:54):
When people think about Cursor and even Cloud Code, it's like a IDE that helps you code and auto completes code and maybe does some agentic work. What I'm hearing here is the vision is different, which is it's a teammate. It's like a remote teammate, a building code for you that you talk to and ask to do things. And that also does IDE, auto complete and things like that. Is that a kind of a differentiator in the way you think about Codex?

Alexander Embiricos (00:15:18):
It's basically this idea that if you're a developer and you're trying to get something done, we want you to just feel like you have superpowers and you're able to move much, much faster. But we don't think that in order for you to reap those benefits, you need to be sitting there constantly thinking about, "How can I invoke AI at this point to do this thing?" We want you to be able to plug it in to the way that you work and have it just start to do stuff without you having to think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:44):
Okay. I have a lot of questions along those lines, but just how's it going? Is there any stats, any numbers you can share about how Codex is doing?

Alexander Embiricos (00:15:49):
Yeah, Codex has been growing absolutely explosively since the launch of GPT-5 back in August. There's definitely some interesting product insights to talk about as to how we unlock that growth, if you're interested. But again, the last stat we shared there was we were well over 10x since August. In fact, it's been 20x since then. Also, the Codex models are serving many trillions of tokens a week now, and it's basically our most served coding model. One of the really cool things that we've seen is that the way that we decided to set up the Codex team was to build a really tightly integrated product and research team that are iterating on the model and the harness together. And it turns out that lets you just do a lot more and try many more experiments as to how these things will work together.

(00:16:35):
And so we were just training these models for use in our first party harness that we were very opinionated about. And then what we've started to see more recently actually is that other major API coding customers are now starting to adopt these models as well. And so we've reached a point where actually the Codex model is the most served coding model in the API as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:55):
You hinted at this, what unlocked this growth, I'm extremely interested in hearing that. It felt like before, I don't know, maybe this was before you joined the team, it just felt like Cloud Code was killing it. Just everyone was sitting on top of Cloud Code. It was by far the best way to code. And then all of a sudden Codex comes around. I remember Karpathy tweeted that he just has never seen a model like this. I think the tweet was the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it. What'd you guys do?

Alexander Embiricos (00:17:30):
We have this strong sort of mission here at OpenAI basically to build AGI. And so we think a lot about how can we shape the product so that it can scale. Earlier I was mentioning like, "Hey, if you're an engineer, you should be getting help from AI thousands of times per day," and so we thought a lot about the primitives for that when we launched our first version of Codex, which was Codex Cloud. And that was basically a product that had its own computer, lived in the cloud, you could delegate to it. And the coolest part about that is you could run many, many tasks in parallel. But some of the challenges that we saw are that it's a little bit harder to set that up, both in terms of environment configuration, like giving the model the tools it needs to validate its changes and to learn how to prompt in that way.

(00:18:20):
My analogy for this is, going back to this teammate analogy, it's like if you hired a teammate, but you're never allowed to get on a call with them and you can only go back and forth asynchronously over time. That works for some teammates and eventually that's actually how you want to spend most of your time. So that's still the future, but it's hard to initially adopt. And so we still have that vision of like, that's what we're trying to get you to, a teammate that you delegate to and then is proactive, and we're seeing that growing. But the key unlock is actually first you need to land with users in a way that's much more intuitive and trivial to get value from.

(00:18:54):
So the way that most people discover, the vast majority of users discover Codex today is either they download an IDE extension or they run it in their CLI and the agent works there with you on your computer interactively. And it works within a sandbox, which is actually a really cool piece of tech to help that be safe and secure, but it has access to all those dependencies. So if the agent needs to do something, it needs to run a command, it can do so within the sandbox. We don't have to set up any environment. And if it's a command that doesn't work in the sandbox, it can just ask you. And so you can get into this really strong feedback loop using the model. And then over time, our team's job is to help turn that feedback loop into you as a byproduct of using the product, configuring it so that you can then be delegating to it down the line.

(00:19:38):
And again, analogy, keep coming back to it, but if you hire a teammate and you ask them to do work, but you just give them a fresh computer from the store, it's going to be hard for them to do their job. But if as you work with them side by side, you could be like, "Oh, you don't have a password for this service we use, here's the password for this service. Yeah, don't worry, feel free to run this command," then it's much easier for them to then go off and do work for hours without you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
So what I'm hearing is the initial version of Codex was almost too far in the future. It's like a remote in the cloud agent that's coding for you asynchronously. And what you did is, "Okay, let's actually come back a little bit, let's integrate into the way engineers already integrate into IDs and locally and help them on ramp to this new world,"

Alexander Embiricos (00:20:21):
Totally. And it was quite interesting because we dogfood product a ton at OpenAI. So dogfood as in we use our own product. And so Codex has been accelerating OpenAI over the course of the entire year, and the cloud product was a massive accelerant to the company as well. It just turns out that this was one of those places where the signal we got from dogfooding is a little bit different from the signal you get from the general market because at OpenAI, we train reasoning models all day and so we're very used to this kind of prompting and think upfront, run things massively in parallel and it would take some time and then come back to it later asynchronously. And so now when we build, we still get a ton of signal from dogfooding internally, but we're also very cognizant of the different ways that different audiences use the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
That's really funny. It's like live in the future, but maybe not too far in the future. And I could see how everyone at OpenAI is living very far in the future, and sometimes that won't work for everyone.

Alexander Embiricos (00:21:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):
What about just intelligence training data? I don't know, is there something else that helped Codex accelerate its ability to actually code? Is it better, cleaner data? Is it more just models advancing? Is there anything else that really helped accelerate?

Alexander Embiricos (00:21:38):
Yeah, so there's a few components here. I guess you were mentioning models and the models have improved a ton. In fact, just last Wednesday, we shipped GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, a very accurately named model, that is awesome. It is awesome both because it is for any given task that you were using GPT-5.1-Codex for, it's roughly 30% faster at accomplishing that task. But also it unlocks a ton of intelligence. So if you use it at our higher reasoning levels, it's just even smarter. And that tweet you were saying Karpathy made about, "Hey, give this your gnarliest bugs," obviously there's a ton going on in the market right now, but Codex-Max is definitely carrying that mantle of us tackling the hardest bugs. So that is super cool.

(00:22:28):
But I will say it's like some of how we're thinking about this is evolving a little bit from being like, "Yeah, we're just going to think about the model and let's just train the best model," to really thinking about what is an agent actually overall? And I'm not going to try to define agent exactly, but at least the stack that we think of it as having is it's like you have this model, really smart reasoning model that knows how to do a specific kind of task really well, so we can talk about how we make that possible. But then actually we need to serve that model through an API into a harness, and both of those things also have a really big role here.

(00:23:02):
So for instance, one of the things that we're really proud of is you can have GPT-5.1-Codex-Max work for really long periods of time. That's not normal, but you can set it up to do that or that might happen. But now routinely we'll hear about people saying, "Yeah, it ran overnight or it ran for 24 hours." And so for a model to work continuously for that amount of time, it's going to exceed its context window. And so we have a solution for that, which we call compaction.

(00:23:28):
But compaction is actually a feature that uses all three layers of that stack. So you need to have a model that has a concept of compaction and knows like, "Okay, as I start to approach this context window, I might be asked to prepare to be run in a new context window." And then at the API layer, you need an API that understands this concept and has an endpoint that you can hit to do this change. And at the harness layer, you need a harness that can prepare the payload for this to be done. So shipping this compaction feature that now just made this behavior possible to anyone using Codex actually meant working across all three things. And I think that's increasingly going to be true.

(00:24:02):
Another maybe underappreciated version of this is if you think about all the different coding products out there, they all have very different tool harnesses with very different opinions on how the model should work. So if you want to train a model to be good at all the different ways it could work, maybe you have a strong opinion that it should work using semantic search. Maybe you have a strong opinion that it should call bespoke tools or maybe you have, in our case, a strong opinion that it should just use the shell and work in the terminal, you can move much faster if you're just optimizing for one of those worlds. So the way that we built Codex is that it just uses the shell, but in order to make that safer and secure, we have a sandbox that the model is used to operating in.

(00:24:45):
So I think one of the biggest accelerants, to go all the way back to answer to your question, is just we're building all three things in parallel and tuning each one and constantly experimenting with how those things work with a tightly integrated product and research team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):
Do you think you win in this space? Do you think it'll always be this kind of race with other models constantly leapfrogging each other? Do you think there's a world where someone just runs away with it and no one else can ever catch up? Is there a path to just, "We win"?

Alexander Embiricos (00:25:15):
Again, comes back to this idea of building a teammate, and not just a teammate that participates in team planning and prioritization, not just a teammate that really tests its code and helps you maintain and deploy it. But even a teammate... If you think, again, an engineering teammate, they can also schedule a calendar invite or move standup or do whatever, right? And so in my mind, if we just imagine that every day or every week some crazy new capability is just going to be deployed by a research lab, it's just impossible for us as humans to keep up and use all this technology. So I think we need to get to this world where you kind of just have an AI teammate or super assistant that you just talk to and it just knows how to be helpful on its own. So you don't have to be reading the latest tips for how to use it, you've plugged it in and it just provides help.

(00:26:10):
So that's kind of the shape of what I think we're building. And I think that will be a very sticky winning product if we can do so. So the shape that in my head, at least I have, is that we build... Maybe a fun topic is like, "Is Chat the right interface for AI?" I actually think Chat is a very good interface when you don't know what you're supposed to use it for. In the same way that if I think of I'm on MS Teams or in Slack with a teammate, Chat is pretty good. I can ask for whatever I want. It's kind of the common denominator for everything. So you can chat with a super assistant about whatever topic you want, whether it be coding or not. And then if you are a functional expert in a specific domain such as coding, there's a GUI that you can pull up to go really deep and look at the code and work with the code.

(00:26:54):
So I think what we need to build as OpenAI is basically this idea of you have Chat, ChatGPT and not as a tool that's ubiquitously available to everyone, you start using it even outside of work to just help you. You become very comfortable with the idea of being accelerated with AI. So then you get to work and you just can naturally just, "Yeah, I'm just going to ask it for this and I don't need to know about all the connectors or all the different features. I'm just going to ask it for help and it'll surface to me the best way that it can help at this point in time and maybe even chime in when I didn't ask it for help." So in my mind, if we can get to that, I think that's how we really build the winning product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
This is so interesting because with my chat with Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, I think he shared that the original name for ChatGPT was Super Assistant or something like that. And it's interesting that there's that approach to the super assistant and then there's this Codex approach. It's almost like the B2C version and the B2B version. And what I'm hearing is the idea here is, okay, you start with coding and building and then it's doing all this other stuff for you, scheduling meetings, I don't know, probably posting in Slack, I don't know, shipping designs. I don't know, is the idea that this is the business version of ChatGPT in a sense, or is there something else there?

Alexander Embiricos (00:28:08):
Yeah. So we're getting to the one-year time horizon conversation. A lot of this might happen sooner, but in terms of fuzziness, I think we're at the one year. So I'll give you a contention and a plausible way we get there, but as for how it happens, who knows? So basically, if we're going to build a super assistant, it has to be able to do things. So we're going to have a model and it's going to be able to do stuff affecting your world. And one of the learnings I think we've seen over the past year or so is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer.

(00:28:41):
Right, okay, so now we're like, okay, we need the super assistant that can use a computer, or many computers. And now the question is, okay, well, how should it use the computer? And there's lots of ways to use a computer. You could try to hack the OS and use accessibility APIs, maybe a bit easier as you could point and click. That's a little slow and unpredictable sometimes. And another way, it turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. So we're kind of getting to this idea where, well, if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent and maybe to the user, a non-technical user, they won't even know they're using a coding agent, the same way that no one thinks about are they using the internet or not, which is they're more just like, "Is WiFi on?"

(00:29:23):
So I think that what we're doing with Codex is we're building a software engineering teammate, and as part of that, we're kind of building an agent that can use a computer by writing code. And so we're already seeing some pull for this. It's quite early, but we're starting to see people who are using Codex for coding adjacent product purposes. And so as that develops, I think we'll just naturally see that, oh, it turns out we should just always have the agent write code if there is a coding way to solve a problem instead of... Even if you're doing a financial analysis, maybe write some code for that.

(00:29:55):
So basically like you were like, "Hey, is this the two ends of this product for the super assistant of ChatGPT?" In my mind, just coding is a core competency of any agent including ChatGPT. And so really what we think we're building is that competency. So here's the really cool thing about agents writing code is that you can import code. Code is composable, interoperable. Because one very reductive view we could have for an agent is it's just going to be given a computer and it's just going to point and click and go around. But that is the future. And then how we get there is difficult to chart a path because a lot of the questions around building agents aren't like, "Can the agent do it?" But it's more about, "Well, how can we help the agent understand the context that it's working in?" And the team that's using it probably has a way that they like to do things. They have guidelines. They probably want certain deterministic guarantees about what the agent can or cannot do. Or they want to know that the agent understands this detail.

(00:30:57):
An example would be if we're looking at a crash reporting tool, hitting a connector for it, every sub-team probably has a different meta prompt for how they want the crashes to be analyzed. And so we start to get to this thing where, yeah, we have this agent sitting in front of a computer, but we need to make that configurable for the team or for the user and let them... Stuff that the agent does often, we probably just want to build in as a competency that this agent has that it can do.

(00:31:24):
So I think we end up with this generalizable thing, that you were saying, of an agent that can just write its own scripts for whatever it wants to do. But I think that the really key part here is can we make it so that everything that the agent has to do often or that it does well, we can just remember and store so that the agent doesn't have to write a script for that again? Or maybe if I just joined a team and you are already on the same team as me, I can just use all those scripts that the agents had written already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
Yeah, it's like if this is our teammate, they can share things that it's learned from working with other people at the company. It just makes sense as a metaphor.

Alexander Embiricos (00:32:01):
Right. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
It feels like you're in the Karpathy camp of, "Agents today are not that great and mostly slop and maybe in the future they'll be awesome." Does that resonate?

Alexander Embiricos (00:32:11):
So I think coding agents are pretty great. I think we're seeing a ton of value there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):
Yeah, that feels right. That feels right, yeah.

Alexander Embiricos (00:32:17):
And then I think agents outside of coding, it's still very early. And this is just my opinion, but I think they're going to get a whole lot better once they can use coding too in a composable way. It's kind of the fun part of when you're building for software engineers, at my startup, we were building for software engineers too for a lot of that journey, and they're just such a fun audience to build for because they also like building for themselves and are often even more creative than we are in thinking about how to use the technology. So by building for software engineers, you get to just observe a ton of emergent behaviors and things that you should do and build into the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:54):
I love how you say that because a lot of people building for engineers get really annoyed because the engineers they're just always complaining about stuff. They're like, "Ah, that sucks. Why'd you build it this way?" I love that you enjoy it, but I think it's probably because you're building such an amazing tool for engineers that can actually solve problems and just code for them.

(00:33:12):
Kind of along those lines, there's always this talk of what will happen with jobs, engineers, coding, do you have to learn coding? All these things. Clearly the way you're describing it is it's a teammate, it's going to work with you, make you more superhuman, it's not going to replace you. What's the way you just think about the impact on the field of engineering, having this super intelligent engineering teammate?

Alexander Embiricos (00:33:33):
I think there's two sides to it, but the one we were just talking about is this idea that maybe every agent should actually use code and be a coding agent. And in my mind, that's just a small part of this broader idea that, hey, as we make code even more ubiquitous... I mean, you could probably claim it's ubiquitous today, even pre AI, right? But as we make code even more ubiquitous, it's actually just going to be used for many more purposes. And so there's just going to be a ton more need for humans with this competency.

(00:34:01):
So that's my view. I think this is quite a complex topic. So it's something we talk about a lot and we have to see how it pans out. But I think what we can do basically as a product team building in the space is just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?

(00:34:27):
I think, to give an example right now, nowadays when you work with a coding agent, it writes a ton of code, but it turns out writing code is actually one of the most fun parts of software engineering for many software engineers. So then you end up reviewing AI code. And that's often a less fun part of the job for many software engineers. So I actually think we see that this plays out all the time in a ton of micro decisions. So we as a product team, we're always thinking about, "Okay, how do we make this more fun? How do we make you feel more empowered? Where is this not working?" And I would argue that reviewing agent written code is a place that today is less fun.

(00:35:04):
So then I think, "Okay, what can we do about that?" Well, we can ship a code review feature that helps you build confidence in the AI written code. Okay, cool. Another thing we could do is we can make it so that the agent's better able to validate its work. And it gets all the way down into micro decisions. If you're going to have an agent capability to validate work, and let's say you have... I'm thinking of Codex Web right now, you have a pain that sort of reflects the work the agent did, what do you see first? Do you see the diff or do you see the image preview of the code it wrote? And I think if you're thinking about this from perspective, "How do I empower the human? How do I make them feel as accelerated as possible?" You obviously see the image first. You shouldn't be reviewing the code unless first you've seen the image, unless maybe it's been reviewed by an AI and now it's time for you to take a look.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):
When I had Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor on the podcast, he had this kind of vision of us moving to something beyond code. And I've seen this rise of something called spec-driven development where you just write the spec and then the AI writes code for you. So you start working at this higher abstraction level. Is that something you see where we're going, just like engineers not having to actually write code or look at code and there's going to be this higher level of abstraction that we focus on?

Alexander Embiricos (00:36:16):
Yeah. I mean, I think there's constantly these levels of abstraction and they're actually already played out today. Today, coding agents, mostly it's prompt to patch. We're starting to see people doing spec-driven development or planned and driven development. That's actually one of the ways when people ask, "Hey, how do you run Codex on a really long task?" Well, it's like often collaborate with it first to write a plan.md, like a markdown file that's your plan. And once you're happy with that, then you ask it to go off and do work. And if that plan has verifiable steps, it'll work for much longer. So we're totally seeing that.

(00:36:50):
I think spec-driven development is an interesting idea. It's not clear to me that it'll work out that way because a lot of people don't like writing specs either, but it seems plausible that some people will work that way. A bit of a joke idea though is if you think of the way that many teams work today, they often don't necessarily have specs, but the team is just really self-driven and so stuff just gets done. And so almost that it's like, I'm coming up with this on the spot, so it's not a good name, but chatter-driven development where it's just like stuff is happening on social media and in your team communications tools. And then as a result, code gets written and deployed.

(00:37:29):
So yeah, I think I'm a little bit more oriented in that way of I don't even necessarily want to have to write a spec. Sometimes I want to, only if I like writing specs. Other times I might just want to say like, "Hey, here's the customer service channel and tell me what's interesting to know, but if it's a small bug, just fix it." I don't want to have to write a spec for that, right?

(00:37:51):
I have this sort of hypothetical future that I like to share sometimes with people as a provocation, which is in a world where we have truly amazing agents, what does it look like to be a solopreneur? And one terrible idea for how it could look is that actually there's a mobile app and every idea that the agent has to do is just vertical video on your phone and then you can swipe left if you think it's a bad idea and you can swipe right if it's a good idea. And you can press and hold and speak to your phone if you want to give feedback on the idea before you swipe. And in this world, basically what your job is is just to plug in this app into every single signal system or system of record, and then you just sit back and swipe. I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:39):
I love this. So this is like Tinder meets TikTok meets Codex.

Alexander Embiricos (00:38:42):
It's pretty terrible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:43):
No, this is great. So the idea here is this agent is watching and listening to you, paying attention to the market, your users, and it's like, "Cool, here's something I should do." It's like a proactive engineer just like, "Here, we should build this feature, fix this thing."

Alexander Embiricos (00:38:56):
Exactly. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
I think it's a really good idea.

Alexander Embiricos (00:39:00):
Communicating with you in the lowest effort way for your consumers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:02):
Yeah, yeah, the modern way we communicate, swipe left to right and vertical feed. And then the Sora video, okay, so I see how this all connects now. I see.

Alexander Embiricos (00:39:11):
Yeah. To be clear, we're not building that, but it's a fun idea. I mean, in this example though, one of the things that it's doing is it's consuming external signals, right? I think the other really interesting thing is if we think about what is the most successful AI product to date, I would argue, it's funny actually not to confuse things at all, but the first time we used the brand Codex at OpenAI was actually the model powering GitHub Copilot. This is way back in the day, years ago. And so we decided to reuse that brand recently because it's just so good, Codex, code execution.

(00:39:46):
But I think actually auto completion and IDEs is one of the most successful AI products today. And part of what's so magical about it is that when it can surface ideas for helping you really rapidly, when it's right, you're accelerated. When it's wrong, it's not that annoying. It can be annoying, but it's not that annoying. So you can create this mixed initiative system that's contextually responding to what you're attempting to do.So in my mind, this is a really interesting thing for us as OpenAI as we're building.

(00:40:22):
So for instance, when I think about launching a browser, which we did with Atlas, in my mind, one of the really interesting things we can then do is we can then contextually surface ways that we can help you as you're going about your day. And so we break out of this, we're just looking at code or we're just in your terminal into this idea that, "Hey, a real teammate is dealing with a lot more than just code. They're dealing with a lot of things that are web content. So how can we help you with that?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:51):
Man, there's so much there. I love this. Okay, so auto complete on web with the browser. That's so interesting. Just like, "Here's all the things that we can help you with as you're browsing and going about your day."

(00:41:01):
I want to talk about Atlas. I'll come back to that. Codex, code execution, did not know that. That's really clever. I get it now. Okay, and then this chatter, what is a chatter-driven development? No, this is a really good idea, but it reminds me, I had Dhanji on the podcast, CTO of Block, and they have this product called Goose, which is their own internal agent thing. And he talked about an engineer at Block just has Goose watch him with his screen and listens to every meeting and proactively does work that he should probably want to do. So ships to PR, sends an email, drafts a Slack message. So he's doing exactly what you're describing in kind of a very early way.

Alexander Embiricos (00:41:45):
Yeah, that's super interesting. And I bet you, so if we went and asked them what the bottleneck to that productivity is, did they share what it is?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:54):
Probably looking at it and just making sure this is the right thing to do, yeah.

Alexander Embiricos (00:41:58):
Yeah. So we see this now. We have a Slack integration for Codex. People love if there's something that you need to do quickly, people will just @ mention Codex, "Why do you think this bug is happening?" It doesn't have to be an engineer. Even maybe data scientists often here are using Codex a ton to just answer questions like, "Why do you think this metric moved? What happened?" So questions, you get the answer right back in Slack. It's amazing, super useful. But as for when it's writing code, then you have to go back and look at the code.

(00:42:25):
So the real, I think, bottleneck right now is validating that the code worked and writing code review. So in my mind, if we wanted to get to something like the friend you were talking about's world, I think we really need to figure out how to get people to configure their coding agents to be much more autonomous on those later stages of the work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):
It makes sense. Like you said, writing code, I used to be an engineer, I was an engineer for 10 years, really fun to write code, really fun to just get in the flow, build architect, test. Not so fun to look at everyone else's code and just have to go through and be on the hook if it's doing something dumb that's going to take down production. And now that building has become easier, what I've always heard from companies that are really at the cutting edge of this is the bottleneck is now figuring out what to build. And then it's at the end of like, "Okay, we have all this, all 100 PRs to review. Who's going to go through all that?"

Alexander Embiricos (00:43:14):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:15):
Yeah.

(00:43:17):
This episode is brought to you by Jira Product Discovery. The hardest part of building products isn't actually building products. It's everything else. It's proving that the work matters, managing stakeholders, trying to plan ahead. Most teams spend more time reacting than learning, chasing updates, justifying roadmaps, and constantly unblocking work to keep things moving. Jira Product Discovery puts you back in control. With Jira Product Discovery, you can capture insights and prioritize high impact ideas. It's flexible so it adapts to the way your team works and helps you build a roadmap that drives alignment, not questions. And because it's built on Jira, you can track ideas from strategy to delivery all in one place. Less chasing, more time to think, learn, and build the right thing.

(00:44:08):
What has the impact of Codex been on the way you operate as a product person as a PM? It's clear how engineering is impacted, code is written for you. What has it done to the way you operate and the way PMs operate at OpenAI?

Alexander Embiricos (00:44:24):
Yeah, I mean, I think mostly I just feel much more empowered. I've always been sort of more technical leaning PM, and especially when I'm working on products for engineers, I feel like it's necessary to dogfood the product. But even beyond that, I just feel like I can do much, much more as a PM. And Scott Belsky talks about this idea of compressing the talent stack. I'm not sure if I've phrased that right. But it's basically this idea that maybe the boundaries between these roles are a little bit less needed than before because people can just do much more. And every time someone can do more, you can skip one communication boundary and make the team that much more efficient.

(00:45:03):
So I think we see it in a bunch of functions now, but I guess since you asked about products specifically, now answering questions much, much easier. You can just ask Codex for thoughts on that. A lot of PM type work, understanding what's changing. Again, just ask Codex for help with that. Prototyping is often faster than writing specs. This is something that a lot of people have talked about.

(00:45:29):
I think something that, I don't think it's super surprising, but something that's slightly surprising is we see... We're mostly building Codex to write code that's going to be deployed to production, but actually we see a lot of throwaway code written with Codex now. It's kind of going back to this idea of ubiquitous code. So you'll see someone wants to do an analysis. If I want to understand something, it's like, okay, just give Codex a bunch of data, but then ask it to build an interactive data viewer for this data. That's just too annoying to do in the past, but now it's just totally worth the time of just getting an agent to go do something.

(00:46:02):
Similarly, I've seen some pretty cool prototypes on our design team about if you want to... Well, a designer basically wanted to build an animation, and this is the Coin Animation Codex, and it was like normally it'd be too annoying to program this animation. So they just vibe coded a animation editor and then they use the animation editor to build the animation, which they then check into their repo.

(00:46:24):
Actually, our designers, there's a ton of acceleration there. And speaking of compressing the talent stack, I think our designers are very PME. So they do a ton of product work and they actually have an entire vibe coded side prototype of the Codex app. And so a lot of how we talk about things is we'll have a really quick jam because there's 10,000 things going on, and then the designer will go think about how this should work. But instead of talking about it again, they'll just vibe code a prototype of that in their standalone prototype. We'll play with it. If we like it, they'll vibe engineer that prototype into an actual PR to land. And then depending on their comfort with the code base, like Codex utilizing Rust is a little harder, maybe they'll land it themselves or they'll get close and then an engineer can help them land the PR.

(00:47:11):
We recently shipped the Sora Android app, and that was one of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, actually, because usage of Codex internally at OpenAI is obviously really, really high, but it's been growing over the course of the year, both in terms of now it's basically all technical staff use it, but even the intensity and know how of how to make the most of coding agents has gone up by a ton. And so the Sora Android app, a fully new app, we built it in 18 days. It went from zero to launch to employees, and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to just GA, to the public, and that was done just with the help of Codex. So pretty insane velocity.

(00:47:55):
I would say it was a little bit... I don't want to say easy mode, but there is one thing that Codex is really good at if you're a company that's building software on multiple platforms, so you've already figured out some of the underlying APIs or systems, asking Codex to port things over is really effective because it has something you can go look at. And so the engineers on that team were basically having Codex go look at the iOS app, produce plans of work that needed to be done, and then go implement those. And it was looking at iOS and Android at the same time. And so basically it was two weeks to launch to employees, four weeks total. Insanely fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:31):
What makes that even more insane is it became the number one app in the app store. This just boggles the mind. Okay, so 28 days?

Alexander Embiricos (00:48:39):
Yeah, so imagine number one app in the app store with a handful of engineers. I think it was two or three possibly in a handful of weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):
Yeah, this is absurd. Wow.

Alexander Embiricos (00:48:56):
Yeah, so that's a really fun example of acceleration. And then Atlas was the other one that I think Ben did a podcast, the engine lead on Atlas, sharing a little bit about how we built there. Atlas is actually... I mean, it's a browser, and building a browser is really hard. So we had to build a lot of difficult systems in order to do that. And basically we got to the point where that team has a ton of power users of Codex right now, and it got to the point they where basically... We were talking to them about it, because a lot of those engineers are people I used to work with before at my startup. And so they'd say, "Before this would've taken us two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week." So massive acceleration there as well.

(00:49:49):
And what's quite cool is that we shipped Atlas on Mac first, but now we're working on the Windows version. So the team now is ramping up on Windows and they're helping us make Codex better on Windows too, which is admittedly earlier, just the model we shipped last week is the first model that natively understands PowerShell. So PowerShell being the native Shell language on Windows. So yeah, it's been really awesome to see the whole company getting accelerated by Codex from... And most obviously, also research and improving how quickly we train models and how well we do it. And then even design, as we talked about, and marketing. Actually, we're at this point now where my product marketer is often also making string changes just directly from Slack or updating docs directly from Slack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
These are amazing examples. You guys are living at the bleeding edge of what is possible, and this is how other companies are going to work. Just shipping, again, what became the number one app in the app store and just beloved all over the... It just took over, I don't know, the world for at least a week. Built, you said, in 28 days and I don't know, 10 days, 18 days just to get the core of it working.

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:00):
Yeah, so it was like 18 days we had a thing that employees were playing with, and then 10 days later we were out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:05):
And you said just a couple engineers.

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:07):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):
Two or three. Okay. And then Atlas you said took a week to build?

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:12):
No, no, no. So Atlas, not the whole week, but Atlas was a really meaty project. And so I was talking to one of the engineers on Atlas about just what they use Codex for. And it's basically like, "We use Codex for absolutely everything." And I was like, "Okay, well, how would you measure the acceleration?" And so basically the answer I got back was, "Previously would've taken two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):
Do you think this eventually moves to non-engineers doing this sort of thing? Does it have to be an engineer building this thing? Could Sora have been built by, I don't know, a PM or designer?

Alexander Embiricos (00:51:45):
I think we will very much get to the point, well, basically where the boundaries are a little bit blurred. I think you're going to want someone who understands the details of what they're building, but what details those are will evolve. Kind of like how now if you're writing Swift, you don't have to speak assembly. There's a handful of people in the world, and it's really important that they exist and speak assembly, maybe more than a handful, but that's a specialized function that most companies don't need to have.

(00:52:14):
So I think we're just going to naturally see an increase in layers of abstraction. And then the cool thing is now we're entering the language layer of abstraction, like natural language, and then natural language itself is really flexible. You could have engineers talking about a plan and then you could have engineers talking about a spec, and then you could have engineers talking about just a product or an idea. So I think we can also start moving up those layers of abstraction as well.

(00:52:39):
But I do think this is going to be gradual. I don't think it's going to go off to all of a sudden nobody ever writes anything, any code and it's just specs. I think it's going to be much more like, "Okay, we've set up our coding agent to be really good at previewing the build or at running tests," maybe that's the first part that most people have set up. And it's like, "Okay, now we've set it up so they can execute the build and it can see the results of its own changes, but we haven't yet built a good integration harness so that it can," in the case of Atlas... By the way, I don't know if they've done any of this or not. I think they've done a lot of this. But maybe the next stage is enable it to load a few sample pages to see how well those work. So then, okay, now we're going to set it up to do that.

(00:53:18):
And I think for some time at least, we're going to have humans curating which of these connectors or systems or components that the agent needs to be good at talking to. And then in the future, there will be an even greater unlock where Codex tells you how to set it up or maybe sets itself up in a repo.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):
What a wild time to be alive. Wow. I'm curious just the second order effects of this sort of thing, just how quickly it is to build stuff. What does that do? Does that mean distribution becomes much, much more important? Does it mean ideas are just worth a lot more? It's interesting to think about how quick how that changes.

Alexander Embiricos (00:53:51):
I'm curious what you think. I still don't think ideas are worth as much as maybe a lot of people think. I still think execution is really hard. You can build something fast, but you still need to execute well on it, still needs to make sense and be a coherent thing overall, yeah, and distribution is massive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
Yeah. Just feels like everything else is now more important. Everything that isn't the building piece, which is coming up with an idea, getting to market, profit, all that kind of stuff.

Alexander Embiricos (00:54:18):
Yeah. I think we might've been in this weird temporary phase where, for a while, it was so hard to build product that you mostly just had to be really good at building product and it maybe didn't matter if you had an intimate understanding of a specific customer. But now I think we're getting to this point where actually if I could only choose one thing to understand, it would be really meaningful understanding of the problems that a certain customer has. If I could only go in with one core competency.

(00:54:52):
So I think that's ultimately still what's going to matter most. If you're starting a new company today and you have a really good understanding and network of customers that are currently underserved by AI tools, I think you're set. Whereas if you're good at building websites, but you don't have any specific customer to build for, I think you're in for a much harder time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:14):
Bullish on vertical AI startups is what I'm hearing. Yeah, I completely agree. There's the general thing that can solve a lot of problems and then there's like, "We're going to solve presentations incredibly well and we're going to understand the presentation problem better than anyone and we're going to plug into your workflows and all these other things that matter for a very specific problem." Okay, incredible.

(00:55:36):
When you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks. What's something you look at to tell you, "Okay, we're making really good progress," I imagine it's not going to be the one thing, but what do you focus on? What's something you're trying to push? What's a KPI or two?

Alexander Embiricos (00:55:51):
One of the things that I'm constantly reminding myself of is that a tool like Codex naturally is a tool that you would become a power user of. So we can accidentally spend a lot of our time thinking about features that are very deep in the user adoption journey. And so we can kind of end up oversolving for that. And so I think it's just critically important to go look at your D7 retention. Just go try the product, sign up from scratch again. I have a few too many ChatGPT Pro accounts that I've, in order to maximally correctly dogfood, signed up for on my Gmail and they charge me 200 bucks a month. I need to expense those. But I think just the feeling of being end user and the early retention stats are still super important for us because as much as this category is taking off, I think we're still in the very early days of people using them.

(00:56:44):
Another thing that we do that I think we might be the most user feedback/social media pilled team out there in this space is like a few of us are constantly on Reddit and Twitter, and there's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints, but we take the complaints very seriously and look at them. And I think that, again, because you can use a coding agent for so many different things, it often is kind of broken in many sort of ways for specific behaviors. So we actually monitor a lot just what the vibes are on social media pretty often, especially I think for Twitter/X, it's a little bit more hypey and then Reddit is a little more negative but real actually. So I've started increasingly paying attention to how people are talking about using Codex on Reddit actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
This is important for people to know. Which of the subreddits do you check most? Is there like an r/Codex or?

Alexander Embiricos (00:57:44):
I mean, the algorithm's pretty good at surfacing stuff, but r/Codex is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):
Okay. I'll take. Very interesting. And then if people tag you on Twitter, you still see that, but maybe not as powerful as seeing it on Reddit.

Alexander Embiricos (00:57:56):
Well, yeah. Well, the thing with Twitter is it's a little bit more one-to-one, even if it's in public. Whereas with Reddit, those are really good upvoting mechanics and maybe most people are still not bots, unclear. So you get good signal on what matters and what other people think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):
So interestingly, Atlas, I want to talk about that briefly. You guys launched Atlas. I tweeted actually that I tried Atlas and then I don't love the AI only search experience. I was just like, "I just want Google sometimes," or whatever. Just waiting for AI to give me an answer, I'm like, "I don't want to... " And there was no way to switch. I just tweeted, "Hey, I'm switching back. It's not great." And I feel like I made some PMs at OpenAI sad. And I saw someone tweet, "Okay, we have Atlas now," which I imagine was always part of the plan. It's probably an example of just, "We got to ship stuff, see how people use it and then we figure it out." So I guess one is that, I don't know, is there anything there? And two, I'm just curious, why are you guys building a web browser?

Alexander Embiricos (00:58:48):
So I worked on Atlas for a bit. I don't work on it now. But a bit of the narrative here for me just to tell my story a bit was I was working on this screen sharing, pair programming startup, and then we joined OpenAI. And so the idea was really to build a contextual desktop assistant. And the reason I believe that's so important is because I think that it's really annoying to have to give all your context to an assistant and then to figure out how it can help you. So if it could just understand what you are trying to do, then it could maximally accelerate you. So I still think of Codex actually as a contextual assistant from a little bit of a different angle, starting with coding tasks.

(00:59:30):
But some of the thinking, at least for me personally, I can't speak for the whole project, was that a lot of work is done in the web. And if we could build a browser, then we could be contextual for you, but in a much more first class way. We weren't hacking other desktop software which have very varied support for what content they're rendering to the accessibility tree. We wouldn't be relying on screenshots, which are a little bit slower and unreliable. Instead, we could be In the rendering engine and extract whatever we needed to help you. And also I like to think of video games, I don't know if you've played, I don't know, say Halo, you walk up to an object, I mean, this is true for many games, you press... Man, it's been a long time, this is embarrassing. Press X and it just does the right thing. And I was one of those guys who always read the instruction manual for every video game that I bought.

(01:00:24):
And I remember the first time I read about a contextual action and I just thought it was this really cool idea. And the thing about a contextual action is we need to know what you are attempting to do. We have a little bit of context and then we can help. And I think this is critically important because imagine this world that we reach where we have agents that are helping you thousands of times per day.

(01:00:49):
Imagine if the only way we could tell you that we helped you was if we could push notify you. So you get a thousand push notifications a day of an AI saying like, "Hey, I did this thing. Do you like it? " It'd be super annoying, right? Whereas imagine, going back to software engineering, I was looking at a dashboard and I noticed some key metric had gone down. And at that point in time, an AI could maybe go take a look and then surface the fact that it has an opinion on why this metric went down and maybe a fix right there right when I'm looking at the dashboard. That would much more keep me in flow and enable the agent to take action on many more things.

(01:01:26):
So in my mind, part of why I'm excited for us to have a browser is that I think we have then much more context around what we should help with. Users have much more control over what they want us to look at. It's like, "Hey, if you want us to take action on something, you can open it in your AI browser. If you don't, then you can open it in your other browser." So really clear control and boundaries. And then we have the ability to build UX that's mixed initiatives so that we can surface contextual actions to you at the time that they're helpful as opposed to just randomly notifying you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):
Hearing the vision for Codex being the super assistant, it's not just there to code for you. It's trying to do a lot for you as a teammate, as this kind of super teammate, and that makes you awesome at work. So I get this. Speaking of that, are there other non-engineering common use cases for Codex? Just ways that non-engineers... We talked about designers prototyping and building stuff, are there any fun or unexpected ways people are using Codex that aren't engineers?

Alexander Embiricos (01:02:24):
I mean, there's a load of unexpected ways, but I think most of where we're seeing real traction with people using things are still for now very, I would say, coding adjacent or tech-oriented, places where there's a mature ecosystem or maybe you're doing data analysis or something like that. I personally am expecting that we're going to see a lot more of that over time. But for now, we're keeping the team very focused on just coding for now because there's so much more work to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):
For people that are thinking about trying out Codex, does it work for all kinds of code bases? What code does it support? If you're like, I don't know, SAP, can you add Codex and start building things? What's the sweet spot? Where does it start to not be amazing yet?

Alexander Embiricos (01:03:11):
I'm really glad you asked this question actually because the best way to try Codex is to give it your hardest tasks, which is a little different than some of the other coding agents. Some tools you might think, "Okay, let me start easy or just vibe code something random and decide if I like the tool." Whereas we're really building Codex to be the professional tool that you can give your hardest problems to. And that writes high quality code in your enormous code base that is in fact not perfect right now. So yeah, I think if you're going to try Codex, you want to try it on a real task that you have and not necessarily dumb that task down to something that's trivial, but actually a good one would be you have a hard bug and you don't know what's causing that bug and you ask Codex to help figure that out or to implement that the fix.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:00):
I love that answer. Just give it to your hardest problem.

Alexander Embiricos (01:04:03):
I will say if you're like, "Hey, okay, well, the hardest problem I have is that I need to build a new unicorn business," obviously that's not going to work. Not yet. So I think it's like give it the hardest problem, but something that is still one question or one task to start. That's if you're testing and then over time you can learn how to use it for bigger things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):
Yeah. What languages does it support?

Alexander Embiricos (01:04:27):
Basically, the way we've trained Codex is there's a distribution of languages that we support and it's fairly aligned with the frequency of these languages in the world. So unless you're writing some very esoteric language or some private language, it should do fine in your language.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:41):
If someone was just getting started, is there a tip you could share to help them be successful? If you could just whisper a little tip into someone just setting up Codex for the first time to help them have a really good time, what's something you would whisper?

Alexander Embiricos (01:04:54):
I might say try a few things in parallel. So you could try giving it a hard task, maybe ask it to understand the code base, formulate a plan with it around an idea that you have and kind of build your way up from there. And the meta idea here is, again, it's like you're building trust with a new teammate. And so you wouldn't go to a new teammate and just give them like, "Hey, do this thing. Here's zero context." You would start by first making sure they understand the code base and then you would maybe align on an approach and then you would have them go off and do bit by bit. And I think if you use Codex in that way, you'll just naturally start to understand the different ways of prompting it because it's a super powerful agent and model, but it is a little bit different to prompt Codex than other models.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):
Just a couple more questions. One, we touched on this a little bit, as AI does more and more coding, there's always this question of, "Should I learn to code and why should I spend time doing this sort of thing?" For people that are trying to figure out what to do with their career, especially if they're into software engineering computer science, do you think there's specific elements of computer science that are more and more important to lean into, maybe things they don't need to worry about? What do you think people should be leaning into skill-wise as this becomes more and more of a thing in our workplace?

Alexander Embiricos (01:06:11):
I think there's a couple angles you could go at this from. Well, the easiest one to think of at least is just be a doer of things. I think that with coding agents getting better and better over time, it's just what you can do as even someone in college or a new grad is just so much more than what that was before. And so I think you just want to be taking advantage of that. And definitely when I'm looking at hiring folks who are earlier career, it's definitely something that I think about is how productive are they using the latest tools? They should be super productive. And if you think of it in that way, they actually have less of a handicap than before versus a more senior career person because the divide is actually getting smaller because they've got these amazing coding agents now. So that's one thing, which is, I guess the advice is just learn about whatever you want, but just make sure you spend time doing things, not just fulfilling homework assignments, I guess.

(01:07:11):
I think the other side of it though is that it's still deeply worth understanding what makes a good overall software system. So I still think that skills, like really strong systems engineering skills, or even really effective communication and collaboration with your team, skills like that I think are important or are going to continue to matter for quite some time. I don't think it's going to be all of a sudden the AI coding agents are just able to build perfect systems without your help. I think it's going to look much more gradual where it's like, okay, we have these AI coding agents, they're able to validate their work. It's still important.

(01:07:51):
For example, I'm thinking of an engineer who was working on Atlas, since we were talking about it, he set up Codex so that it can verify its own work, which is a little bit non-trivial because of the nature of the Atlas project. So the way that he did that was he actually prompted Codex like, "Hey, why can't you verify your work? Fix it," and did that on a loop. And so you still, at various phases, are going to want a human in the loop to help configure the coding agent to be effective. So I think you still want to be able to reason about that. So maybe it's less important that you can type really fast and you understand exactly how to write... Not that anyone writes a 4H loop or something, or you don't need to know how to implement a specific algorithm. But I think you need to be able to reason about the different systems and what makes a software engineering team effective. So I think that's the other really important thing.

(01:08:40):
Then maybe the last angle that you could take is, I think if you're on the frontier of knowledge for a given thing, I still think that's deeply interesting to go down, partially because that knowledge is still going to be... Agents aren't going to be as good at that, but also partially because I think that by trying to advance the frontier of a specific thing, you'll actually end up being forced to take advantage of coding agents and using them to accelerate your own workflow as you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):
What's an example that when you talk about being at the frontier of something?

Alexander Embiricos (01:09:12):
Codex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training runs, the key infrastructure. We move pretty fast and so we have a Codex code review is catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually cause some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. And we're starting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex even be on call for its own training, which is pretty interesting. So there's lots there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:38):
Wait, what does that mean to be on call for its own training? So it's running, it's training and it's like, "Oh, something broke, someone needs..." And does it alert people or it's like, "Here, I'm going to fix the problem and restart"?

Alexander Embiricos (01:09:47):
This is an early idea that we're figuring out. But the basic idea is that during a training run, there's a bunch of graphs that today humans are looking at and it's really important to look at those. We call this babysitting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):
Because it's very expensive to train, I imagine, and very important to move fast and-

Alexander Embiricos (01:10:03):
Exactly. And there's a lot of systems underlying the training run. And so a system could go down or there could be an error somewhere that gets introduced. And so we might need to fix it or pause things or, I don't know, there's lots of actions we might need to take. And so basically having Codex run on a loop to evaluate how those charts are moving over time is this idea that we have to how to enable us to train way more efficiently.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:26):
I love that. And this is very much along the lines of this is the future of agents. Codex isn't just for building code, it's a lot more than that.

Alexander Embiricos (01:10:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
Okay, last question. Being at OpenAI, I can't not ask about your AGI timeline and how far you think we are from AGI. I know this isn't what you work on, but there's a lot of opinions, a lot of, I don't know, timelines. How far do you think we are from a humanly human version of AI, whatever that means to you?

Alexander Embiricos (01:10:56):
For me, I think that it's a little bit about when do we see the acceleration curves go like this? Or I don't know which way I'm mirrored here. When do we see the hockey stick? And I think that the current limiting factor, I mean, there's many, but I think a current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed on writing prompts. And like you were talking about, it's like you can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on can you go review all that code?

(01:11:29):
So my view is that we need to unblock those productivity loops from humans having to prompt and humans having to manually validate all the work. So if we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be binary. I think it's going to be very dependent on what you're building. So I would imagine that next year, if you're a startup and you're building new pieces, like some new app or something, it'll be possible for you to set it up on a stack where agents are much more self-sufficient than not. But now let's say, I don't know, you mentioned SAP, let's say you work in SAP, they have many complex systems and they're not going to be able to just get the agent to be self-sufficient overnight in those systems. So they're going to have to slowly maybe replace systems or update systems to allow the agent to handle more of the work end to end.

(01:12:22):
So basically my long answer to your question, maybe boring answer is that I think starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity. And then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies like hockey stick that productivity. And then somewhere in that fuzzy middle is when that hockey sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI tier.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
I love this answer. It's very practical and it's something that comes up a lot on this podcast. Just like the time to reveal all the things AI is doing is really annoying and a big bottleneck. I love that you're working on this because it's one thing to just make coding much more efficient and do that for people. It's another to take care of that final step of, "Okay, is this actually great?" And that's so interesting that your sense is that's the limiting factor. It comes back to your earlier point of even if AI did not advance anymore, we have so much more potential to unlock as we learn to use it more effectively. So that is a really unique answer. I haven't heard that perspective on what is the big unlock. Human typing speed to review basically what AI is doing for us. So good.

(01:13:31):
Okay, Alexander, we covered a lot of ground. Is there anything that we haven't covered? Is there anything you wanted to share, maybe double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Alexander Embiricos (01:13:43):
I think one thing is that the Codex team is growing. And as I was just saying, we're still somewhat limited by human thinking speed and human typing speed. We're working on it. So if you're an engineer or a salesperson, or I'm hiring a product person, please hit us up. I'm not sure the best way to give contact info, but I guess you can go to our jobs page, or do they have contact for you actually? Do listeners have contact for you?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:10):
Where they send me like, "Hey, I want to apply to Codex"? I do have a contact form at lennyrachitsky.com. I'm afraid of all the amazing people that are going to ping me. But there we go, we could try that. Let's see how that goes.

Alexander Embiricos (01:14:20):
Okay. Or maybe an easier version, we can edit all that out or up to you. Yeah, or I would just say you can drop us a DM. For example, I'm Embirico on Twitter, and hit me up if you're interested in joining the team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):
What a dream job for so many people. What's a sign they... I don't know, what's a way to filter people a little bit so they're not flooding your inbox?

Alexander Embiricos (01:14:42):
So specifically if you want to join the Codex team, then you need to be a technical person who uses these tools. And I think I would just ask yourself the question, "Hey, let's say I were to join OpenAI and work on Codex over the next six months and crush it, what does the life of a software engineer look like then?" And I think if you have an opinion on that, you should apply. And if you don't have an opinion on that and have to think about it first, depending on how long you have to think about it, I guess that would be the filter. I think there's a lot of people thinking about this space. So we're very interested in folks who have already been thinking about what the future should look like with agents. And we don't have to agree on where we're going, but I think we want people who are very passionate about the topic, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
It's very rare to be working on a product that has this much impact and is at such a bleeding edge of where it's possible. What a cool role for the right person. So it's awesome that you have an opening and this audience is a really good fit potentially for that role. So I hope we find someone, that would be incredible. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, Alexander. Are you ready?

Alexander Embiricos (01:15:54):
I don't know what these are, but I'm excited. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):
They're the same questions I ask everyone except for the last one. So probably not a surprise. I should probably make them more often a surprise. Okay, first question, what are a couple of books that you recommend most to other people, two or three books that come to mind?

Alexander Embiricos (01:16:12):
I have been reading a lot of science fiction recently, and I'm sure this has been recommended before, but The Culture, I think it's Ian Banks is the name of the author. Part of why I love it is because it's basically relatively recent writing about a future with AI, but it's an optimistic future with AI. And I think a lot of sci-fi is fairly dystopian. But the joke, at least on The Culture subreddit is that, let me see if I can get this right, it is a space communist utopia, or I think it's a gay space communist utopia. And I just think it's really fun to think about, to use The Culture as a way to think about what kind of world can we usher in and what decisions can we make today to help usher in that world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):
Wow. I don't think anyone's recommended that. I know you're reading, you've mentioned before I start recording, Lord of the Rings right now. If you want another AI-ish sci-fi book, have you read Fire Upon the Deep?

Alexander Embiricos (01:17:15):
No, I haven't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):
Okay, it's incredibly good. It's like a sci-fi space opera sort of epic tale with super intelligence.

Alexander Embiricos (01:17:25):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:25):
Yeah. Mostly not optimistic, but somewhat optimistic.

(01:17:30):
Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Alexander Embiricos (01:17:36):
Yeah, there's an anime called Jujutsu Kaisen, which I really like. Again, it's got a slightly dark topic of demons. But what I love about it is that the hero is really nice. And I think there's this new wave of anime and cartoons where the protagonists are really friendly and people who care about the world rather than being sort of, if you look at some older anime that started the genre, there's Evangelion or Akita and those characters, the protagonists are deeply flawed, quite unhappy. They didn't start the genre, but it was a trend for a while to poke fun at the idea that in these cartoons the protagonist was very young, but being given a ridiculous amount of responsibility to save the world. So there was kind of a wave of content that was critiquing this by making the character basically go through serious mental issues in the middle of the show. And I'm not saying this is better, but at least it's quite fun to have these really positive protagonists are just trying to help everyone around them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:43):
I love how much we're learning about your personality hearing these recommendations. Nice protagonists, optimistic futures. I like the [inaudible 01:18:53].

Alexander Embiricos (01:18:53):
I think if you don't believe it, you can't will it into existence. So you need a balance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:57):
This is your training data.

(01:18:59):
Is there a product you recently discovered you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be some kitchen gadget, tech gadget, a hat.

Alexander Embiricos (01:19:09):
Yeah, so I have been quite into combustion engines and cars. Actually, the reason I came to America initially was because I wanted to work on US aircraft, but now I work in software. And so for the longest time, I've basically only had quite old sports cars, old just because they were more affordable. And then recently we got a Tesla instead. And I have to say that I find the Tesla software quite inspiring. In particular, it has the self-driving feature. And I've mentioned a few times today, I think it's really interesting to think about how to build mixed initiative software that makes you feel maximally empowered as a human, maximally in control, but yet you're getting a lot of help. And I think they did a really good job with enabling the car to drive itself, but all these different ways that you can adjust what it's doing without turning off the self-driving. So you can accelerate, it'll listen to that. You can turn a knob to change its speed. You can steer slightly. I think it's actually a masterclass in building an agent that still leaves the human in control.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):
This reminds me Nick Turley's whole mantra is, "Are we maximally accelerated?"

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Feels like it's completely infiltrated everything at OpenAI, which makes sense, that tracks.

(01:20:32):
Two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often think about and come back to in work or in life that's been helpful?

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:39):
I don't know if I have a life motto, but maybe I can tell you about the number one company value from my startup.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):
Love it.

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:46):
Which is still something that sticks with me, which is to be kind and candid.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:51):
That tracks. Kind and candid. Wow, that's a great combo.

Alexander Embiricos (01:20:54):
Yeah. And we had to put them together because we, as founders, realized that we often would be nice and it wasn't actually the right thing to do. We would delay the difficult conversations and we were not candid. And so every time we would remind ourselves of this motto and then we would become more candid. And then six months later, we would realize that we were in fact not candid six months ago and we needed to be even more candid. So then the question is like, "Okay, how should we be candid?" It's like, "Okay, well, let's think of being candid as an act of kindness," but also think of that both in terms of doing it and willing ourselves to do it, but also in terms of how we frame it as people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:32):
That is a beautiful way of summarizing how to lead well. What's the book about challenge directly but care deeply? Radical Candor.

Alexander Embiricos (01:21:43):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):
So it's like another way of thinking about Radical Candor.

(01:21:46):
Okay, last question. I was looking up your last name just like, "Hey, what's the story here?" So your last name is Embiricos, and I was talking at ChatGPT and it told me the most famous individuals with the surname are the influential Greek poet and psychoanalyst Andreas Embiricos and his relative, the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector, George Embiricos. So the question is, which of these two do you most identify with, the Greek poet and psychoanalyst or the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector?

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:19):
I think it's going to have to be the poet because he loved the island that our family's from.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):
Wait, you know those people? Okay, this is not news to you. Okay.

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:30):
Well, I mean, it's an enormous family. But it's like Greek, so these big families, everyone's your uncle.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):
Love this. Okay.

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:36):
You know what I mean? My mother's Malaysian and also everyone is my uncle or aunt in Malaysia too, if that makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
Yeah.

Alexander Embiricos (01:22:43):
But yeah, he loved this island that the family initiated from. I believe, I don't actually know where that's shipping magnate lived, I think it was New York or something. But anyway, we all came from this island called Andros, which is a really beautiful place. And it's like there's more livestock there than humans. Not too many tourists go there. But I think part of what I think is really cool is he published a lot and a lot of his writing is about the beauty of that island, which I think is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:12):
Wow, that was an amazing answer.

(01:23:14):
Two more questions, where can folks find you if they want to follow you online and maybe reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Alexander Embiricos (01:23:20):
I'm one of those people who has social media only for the purposes of having work. My phone turns black and white at 9:00 PM at night. But yeah, so Twitter or X, @Embirico. And yeah, if you post in r/Codex, I'll probably see it. So you can go there.

(01:23:40):
How can listeners be useful? I would say please try Codex, please share feedback, let us know what to improve. We pay a ton of attention to feedback. I think, honestly, the growth has been amazing, but it's still very early times, so we still pay a lot of attention and hope to do so forever. And also, I would say if you're interested in working on the future of coding agents and then agents generally, then please apply to our job site and/or message me in those social media places.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:10):
Alexander, this was awesome. I always love meeting people working on AI because it always feels like this very, I don't know, sterile, scary, mysterious thing. And then you meet the people building these tools and they're always just so awesome, and you especially, just so nice. And like the examples you shared, optimism and kindness, this is what we want to be. These are the kinds of people we want to be building these tools that are going to drive the future. So I'm really thankful that you did this. I'm grateful to have met you, and thank you so much for being here.

Alexander Embiricos (01:24:45):
Yeah, thanks so much for having me. This was fun.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Boz, the CTO of Meta, said something about you. "Working with Ami, she could have the most profound disagreement in the world and she would respond, fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that."

Ami Vora (00:00:09):
I really enjoy being right and then it turns out in the working world, that did not serve me so great. I think the hard part is sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
I love this very tactical piece of advice when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product.

Ami Vora (00:00:27):
If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday, then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
There's also this metaphor about the hill climb.

Ami Vora (00:00:38):
For me, the hill climb is all about the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever, but then, way off in the distance you can see a mountain. And the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Today, my guest is Ami Vora. Ami is Chief Product Officer at Faire, which connects independent retailers and brands around the world, and I believe is the most successful and biggest B2B marketplace startup out there. Prior to Faire, Ami was employee 150 at Facebook, where she launched the first Facebook developer platform and was later head of product for the $55 billion global Facebook ads business. She also oversaw the introduction of ads on the Instagram platform and most recently, she led product and design for the largest messaging app in the world, WhatsApp.

(00:01:34):
In our conversation we cover a lot of ground, including building your strategy skills, how to disagree with people skillfully, being a successful woman in tech, using metaphors and imagery to rally your team and get your point across, setting up effective goals, plus a bunch of jokes in the lightning round that you don't want to miss. This was a really special and authentic conversation that I'm very excited to bring to you. With that, I bring you, Ami Vora.

(00:02:03):
Ami, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Ami Vora (00:02:06):
Oh, thank you. I'm so happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):
So, when I asked you about your goal for our conversation today, you said the most amazing thing, which I love. You said that your goal is to be as authentic as possible and to show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I love that so much. Let's definitely try to do this. Is there anything else you want to add on that?

Ami Vora (00:02:28):
Yeah, I mean, maybe I'll just say a couple more words on that. Actually, I feel like when I was coming up, when I looked at people who were successful, they seemed to have everything figured out, especially the women. They were all super women, where they respond to every email in 10 seconds, they didn't seem to sleep, they always wore high heels. They were just perfect and I was just like, oh, I guess I'm never going to be successful. That is not me. I love to sleep, I waste time doing absurd things all the time.

(00:03:00):
And I'll tell you how glamorous my lifestyle is, I'm currently working out of my bathroom. I'm talking to you from my bathroom, which is where I work from because I love my house, it's a great house, wasn't meant for work from home, three kids, two parents remote work, and it was just the place with the most closing doors between me and my children when the pandemic started. And so it just took me a while to realize that actually, it's all fine. No one's got it fully figured out, you never know how someone else is living. Most of us are winging it and learning as we're going and learning through trial and error and it's all normal. It's all fine and I can do it and you can do it, and everyone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):
I so love hearing this. This is something people often want to hear more of on this podcast, because there's all these stories of here's all these successes, here's all these things I did and everything, it just always seems to work out. And we try to, we have this failure corner on the podcast where people share story failure. So I love just setting that frame for this conversation of just super being real and being clear that there's a lot of things that go wrong behind the scenes that people often don't hear about.

Ami Vora (00:04:08):
I for a long time felt like I was held back because I don't have a plan, but I realized that probably the most important thing is to just acknowledge that that is true for me. That I'm not going to be a person with a plan, and actually the thing that has consistently served me is to do the thing that feels right, go to the place that feels like home, work with the people who feel like my friends. Just work where when I put on the code of the job, I feel like, oh, this is a place where I could really be lucky, I could be creative, I'm in the right spot, as opposed to feeling like, oh, there is an end state that I know of and I'm just going to have to work my way to that end state. Whenever I get in that zone of, there's only one outcome and I just have to get there, I'm not my best. I'm not bringing the creativity and the luck and the excitement in the same way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:03):
Let me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up, it gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers.

(00:05:34):
Sidebar is a private highly vetted leadership program where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback in every step of your career journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today? Join thousands of top senior leaders who have taken the first step to career growth, from companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta by visiting sidebar.com/lenny. That's sidebar.com/lenny.

(00:06:26):
This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents, fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams, and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.

(00:07:00):
Most product managers will tell you, paperwork sucks. Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature.

(00:07:29):
The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag and drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil, that's useanvil.com/lenny, to learn more or start a free trial. That's useanvil.com/lenny.

(00:07:55):
Let's actually spend some more time here. I wasn't planning to go here yet, but this is really great and important advice. I've just, basically you're saying that a lot of your success has come from following people that are awesome. Can you just talk more about that, just what it is you've followed and seen that has helped you land in places that have worked out so well, because clearly you've done incredibly well.

Ami Vora (00:08:14):
I mean, I think a lot of us are just like, you have a spreadsheet in your head of the axes and certainly when you're choosing between jobs, for me it feels like, oh man, the rest of my career hangs in the balance of making the exact right decision and getting the exact right job. And you work through all of this spreadsheet mass of, if I took this job, here's what it would do for me, here's where I'd be in five years, etc. And I have that engine in my head also, but what I try to do is work through the spreadsheets and then tear it up because none of that stuff is actually going to determine how good I am at the job. The thing that'll determine... In my track record, the thing that has determined it is when I walk through the doors, do I feel like I'm lucky to be there?

(00:09:03):
So for me, it's actually a lot more emotional. I try to just put on the coat of the job. When I wake up in the morning, I'm like, what would it be like if I were doing this job? What would I think about on my commute? Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them? What problems am I going to solve today? And that gives me an emotional response, which is just much more telling than the spreadsheets of, here's where I'm going to be in five years.

(00:09:31):
And for me, the thing that has led me to the places where I do my best work is a feeling of being at home, which is all about trust and trust with the people around me. Can I walk through and feel like these people are going to have my back, they're going to let me take risks, I'm going to enjoy spending time with them? And that's where I feel like I've always just been able to try more things and do better because a big, trust is a big unlock for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):
I love this metaphor of putting on the coat of the job, of just feeling out what it would be to work there. I imagine that was something that you did before you joined Faire, which I want to talk about, but let me transition a bit to talking about Meta and specifically, Boz. The CTO of Meta was on this podcast a few months ago and he said something about you that I want to read.

Ami Vora (00:10:17):
Oh, kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):
Okay, so you've heard what he said about you?

Ami Vora (00:10:21):
[inaudible 00:10:21].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:20):
Okay, cool. So let me read this and then I want to learn from you how to do this. So here's what he said. "Working with Ami, it was like watching an alien because she could have the most profound disagreement in the world with somebody and they would say something that she thought was not just wrong, but crazy wrong, and she would respond, 'Fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.' And she meant it from the core of her being. She saw this schism and rather than reacting as if it was a threat, she reacted with the most genuine and profound curiosity. I just watched it absolutely tear down walls between points of view. Embracing curiosity in those moments of challenges completely changed my life and I owe that to Ami Vora."

Ami Vora (00:10:58):
Oh man, I love Boz, what a great guy, and so kind of him to say that. I mean, I will say that this did not come naturally to me. I really enjoy being right, I love to be right. I think most of us love being right, and at least in my childhood, part of my identity was built on being the person who was right and being the person who knew everything.

(00:11:22):
And then it turns out that in the working world, that did not serve me so great, it wasn't great to walk into things and be like, all y'all are wrong, I am the only answer, everyone please to listen to me and stop talking. And what really happened was that someone pointed out to me that not only... One of my old managers pointed out to me that not only was I spending a lot of energy trying to think through every possible thing by myself so I could be totally right, I was often not really coming to the right answer. Other people have a bunch of information that I do not have. And so I'm just ignoring that, I was letting my ego overtake my desire to get to the best outcome, which is just, that's a silly trade off and an unnecessary one.

(00:12:12):
The thing that changed there is me just saying it's more important for us to get to the outcome and I very selfishly just like to learn more things. And so by deciding that I already knew everything, I was cutting myself off from learning the things that other people were really good at and it's so easy to just open the door instead and say like, hey, you seem to know something that I don't know yet. Why not tell me about it? I'm going to get better. We'll probably come to the right outcome. Maybe you'll have a better time. Why not?

(00:12:45):
And so it was a little bit just accidental evolution in that direction. But it's made work and life so much more interesting to just be like, hey, what does this person know that I don't know yet? It means that every meeting you walk into, you're probably not going to get bored and I get bored a lot, but if you assume that every person there knows something that you don't know, then it's not just wait to get to the right answer, it's like, discover the thing that they know that you don't know and it becomes just a little bit of uncovering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
For people that want to learn to be good at this the way you are, a couple things that I take away from the historian and the way you're talking about this is, one is there's an enthusiasm of, I disagree with you, but I want you to know I really care about what you think. So there's an energy of like, please tell me what I'm missing. There's also this assumption that a lot of disagreement is rooted in, we just have different information, so tell me what I'm missing. Can you talk a bit about just how to, what you've learned about actually do this well?

Ami Vora (00:13:45):
Yeah, I mean, I think the hard part is just sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right. And I think all of growth is a battle with yourself, but this is one of the hardest ones because we all want to be right, we all want to protect ourselves and it served us, many of us for so long to be right. I just try to think about the feedback loop of, I think all of life is feedback loops, so I just started to think about the feedback loop I'm creating of like, I was curious about something. I learned something new, we got for a better outcome. Probably the other person felt better as well as I felt better. It's all positive feedback and you do that a couple of times and the positive feedback far outweighs the desire to be right because now we're more right, we're more right together. And so just building that as a practice of just noticing how much better things can get when you can be open to them, has been really fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:43):
What do you think of this phrase that he used that he remembers? Is that a phrase that you find useful? Just fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.

Ami Vora (00:14:52):
I do think that is a word that I say a lot. I do say that a lot, because it's true, it's fascinating that someone to look at the same movie that I was looking at and come away with a totally different understanding of the plot. I could sit in the same meeting as other people and they would leave with just a different retelling of what happened, and that to me is fascinating. Isn't that surprising, that we can all see the same, what we think are the same facts and walk away with a totally different narrative? And when you really go deep into that and you just understand how people see the world, and that is helpful. I'm curious about things, I like to know more things, and so that just helps me know more things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:36):
I feel like the hardest part of this for people is you hear someone say something, say, okay, so our mutual friend, Dan Hockenmaier, he's in a meeting and he just says something that you are just like, no, because he's got influence. He's a big deal at Faire. Most people have this visceral reaction of like, oh no, I really don't think that's a good idea. Is there something you've learned about controlling that bodily reaction of like, oh, and then just being positive about it?

Ami Vora (00:16:00):
Yeah, I do think it is just that feedback loop. It's not like I don't have the visceral reaction, it's just that instead of interpreting it as this is a visceral reaction, I got to shut something down, it's like, this is a visceral reaction and it's a chance to learn more. Just reinterpreting some of the feelings in ways that are more about opening than about closing stuff down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):
Got it, so it's kind of like a thinking you do of like, okay, hey, let me frame this and think about this [inaudible 00:16:28].

Ami Vora (00:16:28):
For me the most important thing is just taking a pause. I think when you just take a pause, your body calms down, your mind gets a chance to breathe a little bit, and then your response is going to be better, but you got to take the pause because the immediate visceral reaction, is not always... It's going to be primal, it's going to be protective. It's just when you take a pause you're like, this is all fine, let's just learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:52):
I feel like more people are going to start using this phrase, fascinating.

Ami Vora (00:16:55):
Fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:56):
When they hear something [inaudible 00:16:58].

Ami Vora (00:16:57):
It's kind of my tagline. There were a few years where I had to be careful about not saying it because whenever I said it, people would be like, she disagrees. So I've had to use a thesaurus and expand my words I use.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):
No, that's such a good word. Maybe we'll make that the title of this episode.

Ami Vora (00:17:12):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:16):
What a great title that would be. So we've been talking a bit about the bodily reaction to stuff and our lizard brain almost, reacting to things. It reminds me of this metaphor that you called the dinosaur brain and how it applies to product reviews. Talk about what that is.

Ami Vora (00:17:31):
Okay, so a lot of people on my team, they're coming in to do product reviews and they're worried about it. They're stressed out, they don't exactly know what to show, and the normal temptation is just to show as much information as possible because that way you come in and you think, hey, the people in this room are super smart. I'll show them the information, they will come to the right conclusions. They'll probably make a better decision than I'm going to make. So my job is to catalog the information and present it.

(00:17:59):
And one of the first things that I talk to people about is, okay, for the purposes of this conversation, I'm going to put myself in the capitally executive bucket because that makes what I'm about to say less offensive. Assume that executives have a little tiny dinosaur brain. We all have a little brontosaurus brain and we can really only hold three facts at the same time. We will never be able to go deep in the way that you are able to do on everything that crosses our desk. And so the best service you can do is actually do the work of making a recommendation. That's the way we're going to be complimentary. The breadth that I normally have to look across means that I'm going to be better at things like pattern matching or giving you more context or telling you stuff that's happening in the company or the industry. But what I'm not going to be better at is looking at all the information that you looked at and coming up with a meaningful outcome. That's what you're going to do and my little dinosaur brain is going to be like, okay, that sounds like a very reasonable pattern, I've seen other patterns that look like this. Okay, that sounds like an outcome, however, it conflicts with this outcome over here. I can tell you about that. Does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:17):
Yeah, and I love that you put yourself in that bucket. You have a dinosaur brain also, it's not other people.

Ami Vora (00:19:22):
It's a pretty bad, bad look, but it's really true. As you get more breadth, you are less and less able to go deep on everything that deserves going deep and you just end up doing a different service than the people on your team, and recognizing that as complimentary has been really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):
You have this phrase, my manager owns context, I own the recommendation. Kind of along the same lines?

Ami Vora (00:19:42):
Exactly, very similar. And I think the thing that was helpful for me there is that really unlocked what I was looking for from my managers because otherwise I wanted them to be exactly like me. If I assume that I need to bring them information and then they would come to the same conclusion that I would come to, that's very narrow. They have to be able to look at the exact same information and process it in the same way and come out with the same idea. Whereas if what they're doing is complimentary to me, then I can learn from everyone. They're going to just have a different view, they're going to have new information that I don't have, and it gives me a lot more space to take accountability.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):
Is there any other advice that you could share along these lines of just product reviews? So, the big takeaway here is just keep it simple and have a recommendation.

Ami Vora (00:20:30):
Keep it simple, have a recommendation. I also think that, I think we misuse product reviews sometimes as ways to get decisions and actually, they should be ways to calibrate on principles. So what you don't want is to come to a product review for every single that you want to make. Instead, what you want is to come to a product review with one decision, but the goal of that decision is to walk out with principles about how to make these decisions in the future so that you don't have to come to product review, but you still have this consistent and coherent product that you're building.

(00:21:04):
And so I think when you flip the frame of reviews to being less about, okay, I'm going to bring this information to an exec, my manager, whoever, and they're going to decide every piece, you're not actually building that much more capacity in the system. You're getting fast decision making, but you're not changing who can make really good decisions. And I think you always want to change the org to constantly make better decisions, and a way to do that is when you bring these sorts of questions, what you talk about is, why did you make this decision? What are the trade-offs you have in mind? Who are you optimizing for? What timeline are you thinking about? What's the risk level we're willing to tolerate? And then you don't have to come back. You have enough information that you can take those principles and run with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
Is there a framework or a process you use for product reviews that might be helpful for people to hear? Just like a agenda or a way of thinking about just how to set up a product review for success? Because a lot of people are trying to set these up at their companies and they're like, I don't know if we're doing this optimally.

Ami Vora (00:22:05):
Yeah, I think everyone's got... I think there's so many different takes on frameworks. I don't have a single system. I mean, actually I think Boz has written about a bunch of this, and I probably most agree with him. Where there's different kinds of product reviews, it's like, what are you trying to solve? What's the timeline on which you're thinking about for these? Is it a philosophy? Is it a strategic shift? Is it a day-to-day product decision? And then keeping it extremely short and pointed and then making sure you walk away with principles, not answers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:36):
I think there's a lot of nuance and importance there of what you just said, which is start with the problem you're solving. What are we trying to do here? And the timeline, I think that's also really useful and important for people to hear.

Ami Vora (00:22:47):
I think the temptation is always to err toward writing more, and what I always really recommend people do is write whatever you need to write and then cut out almost all of it. What you really want to bring to any forum, whether it's a product review or a written inform or anything else, is the minimal amount of information that you need to make a clean recommendation because then you are forced to be opinionated. Otherwise, the opinion can get lost in all of this information. You can hide behind, well, all of these analyses seem to suggest, and instead you should probably just say, looked at all the data, there's three analyses that suggest this. There's one that suggests that, we think that one is inaccurate or worth taking the risk on. Let's go. Any objections? Let me know. Any new context? Let me know. That really forces you to deeply understand and take an opinion on the material.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):
Final question, who do you like to invite to these product reviews and your thoughts, rules, policy?

Ami Vora (00:23:50):
Yeah, I mean I do think that usually fewer people is better. It leads to a sense of being informal and that is really useful because it lowers the bar on how complete or strong these conversations are and I'd rather have a less formal conversation faster than a formal conversation and lose three weeks in the process when we could have been building. I think it needs to be cross-functional. I think one of the things you want is cross-functional accountability. So we want it cross-functional at the leadership level and cross-functional at the team presenting level. And I think those are normally the groups.

(00:24:25):
I think the thing that gets hard is you often cut out the middle, where if it's a working team presenting to the senior leaders on something important, it's really hard because it means people's managers are not in the room and can't help the conversation or other things. And so in order to do that, you have to really have a bunch of implicit trust inside the team that everyone will get the context later, that everyone's going to be kind to everyone else and you don't need a ton of air cover, and that the managers trust their team to present in the best possible way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
That is always a stressful place for a manager to be, where their success is riding in that meeting and they're not there and they-

Ami Vora (00:25:07):
It's so stressful, it's so stressful. I think anything you do to make it less stressful is useful. But then there've also been times in my career where I would keep the room itself small, but because we were all trying to calibrate on specific principles, I would record or broadcast the reading to anyone who wanted to see it, just so they could all see the principles by which we were decision-making and get calibrated on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):
So through your career you've transitioned from being the person pitching the products and being reviewed to the person reviewing and being on the other side. Is there anything being on this side of it that you think is helpful for people earlier in their career to know about that experience, from your angle now?

Ami Vora (00:25:53):
I mean, I think for what it's worth, I think I still do a fair amount of product pitching in the past few years because there's always someone else to convince.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
That's true.

Ami Vora (00:26:01):
Especially if you want to do something dramatically different. Really, I think the biggest service for people who are starting out a little earlier is that point around bringing the recommendation, really having the opinion and standing behind it with conviction and doing what they need to do to build that conviction for themselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
Awesome. You've done this a number of times already in this conversation, and so I want to spend a little time here, which is using metaphors and imagery to make your point and get people to understand what you're trying to say. So you have this code of putting on the coat of the job and this dinosaur brain, and so someone told me that this is just a skill you have where you use metaphor and imagery to rally a team, get your point across, get people to understand what you're trying to say. There's also this metaphor, someone told me I need to ask you about the hill climb metaphor. Does that ring a bell?

Ami Vora (00:26:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:53):
Okay, what is that all about?

Ami Vora (00:26:55):
For me, the hill climb is all about the difference between the local optimum and a global optimum. That sounds very abstract, but I think a lot of the time when we're doing our job, when we're doing life stuff, whatever you're doing, you try to just get better and better and you optimize your current system and then you feel really good about it, and that is great. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see the, I don't know, rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever. But then way off from the distance you can see a mountain, one that's even higher than you can't even see the top of it, and you have to decide, are you going to take the risk of climbing down your hill, crossing an unknown chasm, and then climbing back up, just to get to the same level you started at with more climbing to do to get to that summit? And that is really hard.

(00:27:51):
I'm thinking of things like, maybe the first time I saw this was like a lot of companies were really good at desktop and you could see the mobile mountain way out over there, but to get there you had to really make a lot of trade-offs in your core desktop business that you were not totally sure were going to pay off when you made it to the mobile mountain, and you had to do a ton of work. You had to fundamentally rewire a lot of what you're doing without a guarantee that you're going to get there. I mean, you can see it in life when you think about new jobs or new moves or new relationships, anything that you think about. You are giving up something that is working pretty well without knowing whether you're going to make it to the top of that next mountain. And that's been really helpful to me just to place where I am on different things, where you get the inkling that there is a much better way to do this, there really is.

(00:28:48):
Is it going to be worth going down into the valley, climbing up, keeping climbing? Is that going to be worth it? Most of the time the answer is yes, but it's helpful for me to know, boy, this feels like a slog. It is supposed to? Because I'm still in the valley and the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like. When you're on top of it and you're like, this is great, it was absolutely worth it. My life is better in these ways, we're able to solve these problems in these ways. It was worth it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:19):
I love that. It feels like a big value of the metaphor, which I love is that to set expectations, it's going to be really hard for a little bit or we will slow down what we're trying to do now, but the idea is there's a bigger hill and a bigger mountain.

Ami Vora (00:29:32):
It's a bigger hill and it's worth it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):
On this kind of broader idea of metaphors and imagery, is there something there that you've learned of just like, this works really well, I'm going to invest in becoming better at this, or is this something that's come natural to you? Anything you can share about that skill and approach?

Ami Vora (00:29:46):
I think this one came from, I worked for a manager, his name was Eric Antino, and he was just a master of the metaphor and analogies. And so whenever I would bring him something, he would be like, how is this product going to make you feel, and when is the last time that you felt this way? And you can say, oh, I felt this way when I was hanging with my friends in Dolores Park and he'd be like, cool, tell me what it feels like, why that's the analogy, what ramifications come out of that?

(00:30:18):
And one thing I like to do is try to build an emulator for different people in my head, because I've just had the good fortune of working with an amazing number of very different leaders, and so he's one of the people I tried to build an emulator for where I'd be like, okay, I see this thing. I don't know how to solve this problem. How would Eric describe this? I've tried to build one for Boz, which is all about principle of decision making and principle of trade-offs. There's a few other people where I'm like, I don't know how to solve this problem. Can I load this other person into my head and how would they approach it? And that gives me a fresh lens on it.

(00:30:55):
And I really like metaphors and analogies because I think especially as you scale a team, narrative becomes increasingly important. Narrative can carry so much weight and water where otherwise it's similar to the product review point, where either you can tell everybody exactly what to do at every point or you can create a story that we all agree on. And when we all agree on that story, people just know better what to do. If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday. You know what the iconography, the designers know what iconography should look like. You know what the communication and join pattern should look like. You're not going to build something cold and corporate, you're not going to build something strobe light, you're not going to build something flashy, but you don't have to go and make all those individual decisions. You can buy into the same story and then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):
This is such a powerful and important skill. Is there an example that comes to mind where you did this really well, say at WhatsApp or Facebook of the story that carried a lot of water for you and the team?

Ami Vora (00:32:08):
Yeah, I mean I think the product metaphor we arrived at for WhatsApp was face-to-face communication. Our goal there was to make it so that every person in the world could feel connected to the people they cared most about, even when they were separate, even they're distant geographically for whatever reason, we were always going to be apart from the people you cared about. And we really had to build something that would work for literally everyone in the world. People who are carrying these high-end devices in western markets who are very tech comfortable and savvy, and people in the low end markets who were carrying these low end devices, they weren't that familiar with technology, it was maybe their first time online. We had to build something that worked for everyone.

(00:32:57):
And the most universal form of communication is face-to-face. When you talk to someone face-to-face, you're not thinking, how do I present? What tool do I have to learn? You just open your mouth and words come out, and that's the feeling that we wanted to create. And that involved a lot of the app stepping back from communication, creating spaces that felt really intimate so people wouldn't have to think to themselves, what kind of space am I in? They could immediately map where they were in the app to the, okay, I'm sitting around in my kitchen table and people are joining and leaving calls just like they're walking in and out of my living room, but it is a family space and the family is there. Or, in one-on-one disappearing messages, you're like, cool, this is my close friend. We don't need to keep track of everything that we're saying. We're here for a little bit of banter, a little bit of relationship, a little bit of quick, what's your wifi password and stuff, and whatever's really important, that's what we'll hold onto and the rest is just day-to-day, normal intimacy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):
That is super interesting. WhatsApp, one of the main differentiators and benefits is it's super fast. And I see completely how it connects this idea of you're just like, ideas, we want you to feel like you're talking to someone.

Ami Vora (00:34:09):
And it's all really a small thing. It's like a typing indicator is like someone who's about to take a breath, give them a second to talk, the two check marks lighting up or someone's face lighting up when they hear you, it's just a recognition of being heard. These are all super small things, but I think they add up to a feeling of being there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
That is super interesting. So I love this very tactical piece of advice that you just shared of just when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product and when else have they felt that same feeling? So interesting. And then this other point you made of making this emulator of a person in your head.

Ami Vora (00:34:49):
I mean, it sounds a little wild now that I think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):
No.

Ami Vora (00:34:51):
That's robotic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:52):
It makes total sense.

Ami Vora (00:34:55):
I get very bored a lot. It's another way to make sure meetings are really interesting where you're like, okay, let me see what that person is going to say next. Let me put myself in their shoes. Let me think about what they're reacting to and why they're going to think that and how they're going to see the world. And again, it just gives me more toolkits because it means when I'm stumped on something, I can be like, what would Rob Goldman say? He'd say, look at the dashboard. Have I looked at the dashboard? No. Okay, let me go look at the dashboard. You can load up these different skillsets that people have been so generous with sharing with me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:28):
What would be the Ami emulator? What are people thinking when they loaded it?

Ami Vora (00:35:33):
Fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:33):
Fascinating?

Ami Vora (00:35:35):
Fascinating, probably the number one, no joke.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:37):
Is there an emulator you most often come back to that you find most useful in just in your day-to-day? Who's the person that like, oh yeah-

Ami Vora (00:35:44):
I think those are the three. I think it is like Antino's story. Story, metaphor, analogy creation. I think it's like Boz's, if we played this out, what principles are we using? And if we kept on using those principles, what would happen? And it is Rob Goldman, who's an amazing metrics growth product leader being like, look at the dashboard. I mean, look at the dashboard, which is a great central rooting part of my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:16):
This was so fascinating, fascinating.

Ami Vora (00:36:19):
It revs up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):
I love this topic of just metaphors and stories and visions and things like that. It's something that a lot of people are wanting to get better at. Is there another example, per chance, that you could share of maybe using a metaphor to rally team, get things done?

Ami Vora (00:36:34):
I mean, I think taking a sub part of WhatsApp or when we talk about video calling. I really, one the metaphors was sitting around in your family room when you think about how to make calls work, where when you're sitting in a family room, you're not scheduling it, you're not, I don't know, having this cold corporate feeling, the way you do with a conference where there's heavyweight interactions, and instead there's just, you can join and leave. It feels lightweight, it feels like the space exists even when you're not there. And so just creating things like joinable calls, like that feeling of people popping in and just paying attention to whoever's there and letting them leave, but the call can flow on without a super heavyweight action that everyone needs to take. I think that was another one where we were just able to agree on the feeling and then you know what to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
I was just using WhatsApp to do video call with my mom. They were traveling to Italy and so-

Ami Vora (00:37:30):
That's great, that's exactly [inaudible 00:37:33].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:32):
I experienced it, it felt great.

(00:37:35):
Let me go in a slightly different direction. One of my favorite posts of yours is called execution beats strategy every time, and I think another way you phrase it is, execution eats strategy for breakfast. I think you put that somewhere. I'd love to hear about this because I completely agree. I think a lot of people obsess with strategy and vision and got to get this right and forget that most of the work is execution. So yeah, I'd love to hear just your take and insight here.

Ami Vora (00:37:58):
Yeah, I don't know if I coined execution eats strategy for breakfast, I think a lot of things eat other things for breakfast, but I'm a believer. I do think execution eats strategy for breakfast and that's something we used to say a lot at Meta. It was just the most important part and I was well-trained in that. That was one of the key lessons that I learned there, and it's because when you have... Look, strategy is super fun. You get to think about all this pie in the sky stuff. You get to think about if the world operated in rational patterns and you could predict the future, what is going to be the second and third order effect? You get to use your brain in a really fun, philosophical way, but customers don't care. Customers don't care about your fancy strategies and your five-year plan. They care about the product that's in their hands. And so anything that distracts you from thinking about the product in your hands I think, or maybe worse, takes you away from solving customer's problems today, I think is a distraction.

(00:39:03):
And I think one of the things that you learn is if you have great strategy, perfect strategy but poor execution, you don't win because your strategy never makes it to the market. And what's even worse is that you have learned nothing. You don't know whether it was your strategy that was wrong or whether it was your execution that was wrong, all you know is you didn't win. Whereas when you have a pretty good strategy, a good enough strategy, you're in the right direction and you have perfect execution, you still don't win immediately, but you know your execution was great. So then you learn, what do you need to do to improve your strategy? You've got the execution machine, you go back, you update your strategy, you relaunch, and you keep on doing it until your strategy is perfect and then you do win. And that's the lesson I repeatedly learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:50):
Is this advice a reaction to what you said, where people, PMs let's say, are just like, I want to work on strategy, we got to spend all this time, get the strategy nailed, and it's just like, okay, we also need to execute and that's maybe even more important.

Ami Vora (00:40:02):
Yeah, I do think it's very glamorous to work on strategy. It's so fun. It's so fun to have the word strategy in your [inaudible 00:40:11]. I don't know, we've built a mythology around strategy being the most important thing. And execution is not glamorous, it is not like white-boarding by yourself and pointing to things and coming out with the grand vision. It is the nuts and bolts and sometimes boring, sometimes grind it out work of like, you got to bring the donuts, you got to look at the dashboards, you got to rewrite the spec. You got to just do a bunch of the grinding, but that is what leads to the customer's outcomes. That is what the customer is eventually going to feel. They're never going to see the whiteboard, they're going to see that someone took the time to fix this bug.

(00:41:39):
Is this advice you give to your PMs on your teams? I guess, how do you think about this when they're trying to move up the ranks, become better product managers? Is this just a common thing that you often share, like yeah, strategy is going to be amazing, important. You got to get good at it, but also make sure this is going great.

Ami Vora (00:41:57):
Yeah, I think about it a little bit in terms of proportion of time you should expect to spend. So I mean, there's no point next being on that strategy, you can't have a bad strategy. So you should spend some time, maybe it's like 20% of your time, but the bulk of your time should be confirming that strategy actually makes sense for the customers. Getting it out there, building the machine to constantly make it better, as opposed to a perfect strategy. You go away, you build it for a year, you ship it, the market has changed. Customers have changed, their needs have changed, competition, just the whole landscape has changed and you probably could have solved those problems more easily had you headed in the right direction, but done it with more ongoing customer feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:39):
In terms of this proportion, I imagine what you see is as you get more senior, more of your time spent on strategy, less time on execution, right?

Ami Vora (00:42:46):
I don't 100% know that that's true. I think again, even at high levels, maybe the strategic directions become more important to get mostly right, but I think still most of your time is making sure they can make it to market. I think you should still be spending your time understanding what's slowing people down and unblocking it. Understanding, how is the market changing? Understanding what the broad customer feedback is, just constantly improving the system that you are building. I think that's, I mean, how much time can you spend thinking about the future, as opposed to actually trying to create it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:29):
That is really interesting advice because I think most people imagine as you get more senior, I'm going to have more time thinking about vision and strategy, not have to be in the weeds building things. And I love this point you're making of even as a senior exec, you're still, it's executing in a different way, but it's still execution.

Ami Vora (00:43:44):
A different way, yeah. You're focusing on the execution of the system a little bit more, but you got to stay connected, I think, to the customer and to what you're bringing to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:54):
I love that. Obviously, strategy is also very important. You have this great quote that I'm going to read here. "For strategy to be useful, it actually has to change our behavior as a team to create better customer outcomes." Can you talk about that?

Ami Vora (00:44:08):
Yeah. I mean, I think again, some of the joy of strategy is the philosophy and excitement of thinking about all the long-term stuff that will happen, but I try to always come back to, what's going to change for the customer? If we have all of these conversations and we come out with this shiny five-year plan, but then we change nothing about the products that we're building or how we are building, what was the point of that exercise? It made us feel good, and there's something to making us feel good. That is good, it's important for teams to feel good and connected and this is a good exercise for that, but it's so much more powerful when it's an exercise that translates into us doing something differently, whether that's prioritizing different products, whether that's changing our portfolio allocation, like moving people to the things we think are most important now versus things that are going to be less important right now. What's the change, or coming out with a strategy that'll align people because we have the story, we have the narrative, we have the sequence. What's going to change for our customers as a result of this strategy exercise?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):
Many people want to get better at strategy. Often their performance feedback is become more strategic, think better about strategy. What has helped you become a better strategic thinker? Is it just doing it? Is it a person that influenced you heavily? Is it a book? What has helped you and what do you often recommend to people to get better at this skill?

Ami Vora (00:45:30):
I think I got that same feedback quite a lot, actually, of needing to think bigger and be more visionary, etc. And I still do, frankly, actually, there's moments where I retrench way too far into execution and worry a little less about long-term strategy. So it's definitely my bias still.

(00:45:49):
The biggest thing that held me back from talking about strategy was I didn't feel confident that I knew enough to declare a strategy. It was actually almost like a self-confidence, imposter syndrome thing, where there were people who could just say, I know how the world is going to develop in the next five years, and let me tell you, here's where we're going to be, this is the dot on the map. And I was always like, how could anything could happen? Who would I be to say I know how the world's going to develop and here's where we're heading?

(00:46:21):
And so for me, a lot of it was actually learning the things that made me feel confident in my own opinion. And there's a bunch of things that do make me feel confident in my opinion. When I talk to specific customers and I feel like I can build an emulator for them, like a customer on my shoulder where I can say, oh, I talked to this person working in this job, here's what they would say if I showed them this product or this strategy. So, I think talking to customers is a big unlock for me and feeling like I have unique knowledge of the customer. I think working through different product iterations of, if we thought this was the right outcome, what would it really look like from a product perspective or a product portfolio in three to five years? And which of those seems right or rational or it will go the way I think the world goes. I think asking for other opinions. Sometimes I run surveys to the leadership team where I'm just like, what percentage of our revenue is going to come from small businesses versus big businesses in three years? And if we all agree on that topic, we should just take it as the truth and we should just fill it. If we disagree, then we should talk about it and we should talk about the strategic ramifications if we chose one path or the other path.

(00:47:35):
So for me, it was getting more comfortable having an opinion, honestly, about how the world was going to go, and also feeling comfortable that we would be able to change it when we learned that maybe that wasn't exactly right. We would have the machine, the execution machine behind it to try it out and then change and iterate and improve with customer feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):
At which point in your career was this overcoming this fear and uncertainty? Was it sometime within Facebook?

Ami Vora (00:48:07):
It was sometime within Facebook. It was really when I was stepping into the bigger ads jobs, getting to be Head of Product for Facebook ads. I got feedback, I got a lot of feedback over the course of my career and some of the stacking of feedback was basically like, you could be the smartest person in the room, but it doesn't matter if people don't like you, which is very complicated feedback and I wouldn't give that feedback to anyone else, but I took it very seriously. It was coming from so many different places, it was coming from people I'm really trusted. And so I went out of my way to be more likable, which for me ended up being shrinking myself a little bit and not being so aggressive and not being so opinionated, being more unobjectionable.

(00:49:07):
And the weird part is that it worked for a long time. People were more likely to work with me, they were more likely to say nice things. I mean, I take this to extremes. I wore earth tones for two years because I was just like, I got to fade back a little bit. And then at some point I actually had to do a leadership job and my team was like, well, what do you think? What's your opinion? And I was like, you've been telling me not to have an opinion for so long. And so it took a little bit of work to get back to, oh yeah, I have a lot of opinions, I have a lot of thoughts. It is okay for me to express. It is needed, my team needs me to have these opinions and thoughts and be a leader who can take ownership and be visible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Thanks for sharing that. Do you think that was the right approach, going and indexing far to the other end and then realizing that maybe that's too far, or do you think you would've done things differently looking back?

Ami Vora (00:50:05):
Yeah, it's one of my Roman empires. I think about this every so often, way too much, I think. Especially because I talked to other senior women who received similar feedback and chose not to act on it or did act on it, and what happened to their paths were different. I think where I landed is I wouldn't give that feedback to someone else. And the way I do give that feedback, actually, because I think there is a lot of really useful information in that. The way I do give that feedback is, you do need to be able to work with a broader range of people and the way to do that is to expand your tool sets. You're not going to make yourself smaller, you're not going to be any less of who you are, but you are going to build new tools, new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors. And that is only going to make you bigger and more powerful and more expansive. But the end outcome is the same, is that you can work with more different styles of people, more different styles of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):
I love that framing. There's an episode that's going to come out before this episode with this professor from Stanford, Jeffrey Pfeffer, who teaches a class called The Path to Power, which is how to become powerful in the world. And he actually has a big lesson that many people hate hearing, which is, you don't need to be authentic in the workplace, what you're trying to achieve, you're trying to achieve stuff and you can do... You need to use tools that you need to use to achieve the thing you want to achieve. So sometimes don't be exactly who you are and act in a slightly different way, which is basically what you're describing.

Ami Vora (00:51:42):
More tools. I think that's a theme that's coming up, is just like, I'm all about more lenses, more keys, more tools in general because why not? Why not have access to more different styles of things?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:54):
Something that you were talking about subtly is the being a woman in tech and being a female leader. I imagine you've gone through some stuff that isn't what something men would've gone through. Is there anything there that you want to share or anything you've learned about just being really successful as a woman in tech?

Ami Vora (00:52:13):
I think we've talked through some of them. I think one, you get a different style of feedback and a lot of the ways to interpret that feedback. I think to this day, I get feedback that is about walking a very narrow tightrope where not only do you have to change a bunch of things and do a bunch of things that are important, you have to make people feel a certain way about how you do them and the ways that they want you to make you feel are diametrically opposite. Some people are going to be like, be more directive so that way everyone knows your thing. Some people are going to say be less directive so people can come to their own conclusions. Some people are going to say move faster because there's always more you can do. Some people are going to say move less fast because otherwise you're going to end up steamrolling people.

(00:52:57):
And a lot of it is personal, there's a bunch research about how women get a lot more personal feedback that is less about the content of their role and more about their style, I think that is still true and there's often a kernel of truth in it. For me, this is forever work. I do have biases toward execution and being directive and things like that, but I think learning how to interpret and respond to feedback has been a really important point for me and making my choices of, just because I'm getting feedback doesn't mean I immediately need to respond to all of it. There's a step in between where I can choose, is this feedback I want to take action on in this exact way? Am I going to look for more themes, take action in a different way, or am I going to say this is who I am and I understand the trade-offs, I'm going to do a better job of giving people context on the decisions I'm making and why I'm choosing these trade-offs. But actually this is part of how I want to operate and I'm going to keep on operating.

(00:54:01):
And then I think we just give women weird advice. Here's a hot take. I think we tell women things like, you need to find a mentor and you need to find a sponsor, and that's just another set of hoops that we have that we tell women to jump through that I don't think we tell other parts of the population to jump through. I think we tell women to unlock your future success, you've got to find somebody who has made all the same life decisions you have and who you look up to and relate to, but who also had an hour every month to be an oracle to tell you all the things you do in your life. And it feels like yet another burden where you're like, I don't know how to do that.

(00:54:45):
I had the extreme generosity of so many wonderful leaders who helped me on my way, but I didn't feel like I had this mentor and for a while it was just like, oh man, if I only had a mentor, I would know how to do all of this stuff and it felt like another weight that I needed to carry, which I didn't. I had everything I needed, people were so kind and generous, but I didn't recognize it that way because we talk about it differently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):
Thank you for sharing all that. I wasn't planning on going in this direction, but this is such important advice for say, young women that are just getting started in the same product. Is there any advice you'd want to share to help them get to be the next Ami?

Ami Vora (00:55:23):
Oh, I mean number one, no next Ami, they're going to be their next themselves. That is maybe the most important thing, is everyone will only tell you their own story. That's all anyone can do, but the thing that I tell people is, don't dampen who you are and your strengths, just continue expanding. Whenever you run into a problem, just add more to the things that you can do, the tools that you have, the way you can express yourself. Just keep on adding and growing and don't shrink yourself, ever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):
I love that. I want to move to a different topic. There's a few things I definitely wanted to touch on while we had our time together. One is that I hear, now this is going to be a total tangent, but I think it's really important and I'm excited to talk about it. I hear you're really good at setting goals and aligning incentives really well for teams. One of your colleagues told me you're best in class at building product orgs and figuring out how product orgs can best work with other teams. I'm curious if there's any tricks or lessons you can share here about what you've learned about how to do this well.

Ami Vora (00:56:27):
Yeah, I mean I think one thing is to try to decouple all the things we're trying to do. Sometimes when you give people direction, you're like, okay, everybody just go get revenue or everybody just go get GMV. And it seems obvious because that's the thing you have to do as a company, but there's only a few places where you are guaranteed to get that and it's measurable and you can do it. And that leads to what I call toddler soccer, where everybody just runs to the same surface or the same customer set or the same exact product where you can do this and it's measurable and you end up, everyone's tripping on each other, everyone's trying, nobody really gets contact on the ball, there's no coordination. I have three kids, I've watched a lot of toddlers play soccer. [inaudible 00:57:18], it's a very fresh, very fresh metaphor.

(00:57:20):
And instead, one of the things I like to do is just detangle, okay, as a company, let's think about our customers. Let's think about all the things they're going to need in their journey. Let's think about how we will know how we will match our own metrics to customer success. Let's play the entire field. What would it look like if we could detangle it so that every team we had internally had a different goal that ladders into a goal framework that's actually the thing that we need to do to solve the full customer impact? And then you don't have the same swim lanes problem. You have plenty of room for people to make progress on their lanes. They all know how they fit into the bigger picture, and it just opens up a lot more growth for every team and it makes sure that we're solving the customer problem end to end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):
Is there an example that you could share to make this even more concrete from say, WhatsApp or Facebook or Instagram or anything like that, where you can share some of these goals that you've like, oh, this worked out really well? I know it's probably private information and partly-

Ami Vora (00:58:25):
It might be trickier. I mean, maybe going back to the GMV example. Maybe instead of motivating everyone on GMV, you motivate them on GMV per surface and you divide up the surfaces, or maybe you motivate them on actually different goals that underlie. When you think about GMV, what are all the various engagements, customer engagements that lead to GMV? Can you goal on those input metrics, can you goal on number of people who visit, number of people who convert, number of people who reorder, number, etc? Rather than going strictly on the output.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):
So the core advice here is each team should have different goals that are part of this metrics tree that ladder up to revenue, GMV, something like that?

Ami Vora (00:59:07):
Whatever, yeah. The thing that best matches the overall customer outcome that mirrors the company outcome as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
Got it. And there's always this balance between it's actually the best metric versus it's something they can move and understand and it's easy to watch and it's movable and things like that, right?

Ami Vora (00:59:24):
Yeah, and you have to have faith that it is actually connected to that output metric. You don't want to create a metric that's disconnected just to make a team feel good. It really does need to solve the customer problem and that's reflected in company's performance, but you can usually break it down into smaller pieces and I think that breaking down into smaller pieces and assigning those out to teams, that's really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
Is there anything else along these lines of things you've learned about helping teams work together and not play toddler soccer, beyond having different goals that all ladder up to the one that really matters?

Ami Vora (00:59:58):
I think there's value in also acknowledging that teams are going to have different incentives. Even inside a team like cross-functional teams on the same pod or whatever, are going to have different incentives, they're going to come in with different information, they're going to have disagreements. And certainly, different teams inside a company or different pillars inside a company, different products inside, they're all going to have different incentives, and I think sometimes that feels like something is going wrong when people disagree, but actually, that's just a sign of healthy tension and knowledge.

(01:00:34):
I think the thing that makes tension healthy is one, when you can acknowledge it and say, yeah, of course there's tension. You're bringing different information than I'm bringing. We should be disagreeing. No one's a bad person, no one is coming in with poor intent. Everyone's doing the thing they are supposed to do and that is a useful thing to do. And then you have to agree on an outcome that you're aiming for. If you disagree on what the company outcome is or what the customer outcome is, then you've got some structural stuff you need to work out and normally you just have to escalate it, but if you agree on like, we're all trying to move this metric by changing this customer experience, then all you're doing is having a conversation about the best way to do that using the different information that everyone is bringing. And I think that's super important to just have as a rational, open, explicit discussion, as opposed to trying to hide it or pocket vetoing or something else. Because you assume that when someone disagrees with you that, I don't know, there's something emotional or wrong about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):
But it's fascinating.

Ami Vora (01:01:40):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):
There's a piece of advice I once heard from the Head of Product at Airbnb once where we were trying to find, reorg the business and try to figure out the best org and his advice and something he realized is, there's never the best org, there's just the best idea we have at the time with the here's the things we know are not going to be optimal about it and let's build processes around that.

Ami Vora (01:01:59):
I think that's my take on leadership in general. Especially as you get more senior, you can only make bad decisions. At some point someone can bring you a problem, you can recognize a problem and you can solve it, and there's so much happiness in solving that and tying a bow around it. But as you get senior, the only problems you'll see are ones that are fundamentally unsolvable because otherwise, someone would've solved it before they got to you. And so all you're doing is choosing which branch of suboptimal you're going to put your name on and describing the principles you're using and the context and the fact that it's suboptimal, but it's still the best thing. I think that's a really hard thing, is just to recognize and acknowledge that increasingly people only see you do, make suboptimal decisions and from a distance they're just like, why is that person only making bad decisions? And it's because those are your only options. All you can do is choose the least bad, the best possible for the time, for the problem that's consistent that makes sense with the framework, and that's been a tough thing to learn too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):
You said somewhere that as you get more senior, you get worse at everything because the problems get harder.

Ami Vora (01:03:14):
Yes, exactly. I mean, it's a kind of dark view of leadership where yeah, you can't fully solve problems, you have to say no a lot people are unhappy with you. I thought as you get more senior, everyone listens to you and they like you and you could just say a thing and then it happens and that is not at all accurate. It really is, most of the decisions you make are not going to be perfect.

(01:03:42):
And I think I'm all about just normalizing and acknowledging those hard truths because otherwise, I feel like I'm failing. And if I just know that something is normal that it's part of the job, then it's not me. It's just like, okay, this is a fact of the job that I have to get accustomed to if I want to have this kind of impact. And there's something about having the impact, being able to serve the customer, being able to be part of this team, there's something about it that is so worthwhile that it's worth being terrible at everything and being visibly terrible at everything because that is the best way that I have to have that kind of impact in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:21):
I think this is really important for early ICPMs to hear because they see their CPO and founders making all these decisions and they're like, what the hell? That's a terrible idea, why are they doing this? What you're saying is just like it's the best... Options are limited and then-

Ami Vora (01:04:38):
[inaudible 01:04:38].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:38):
... nothing's going to be optimal.

Ami Vora (01:04:39):
Yeah, no org is optimal. It's definitely not. You can optimize for the people you have and you can optimize for the products you have, can optimize for the customers you have and you can optimize for the technology you have. Those are the options that you have, and in every one of those you trade off everything else. And so you just have to know, there's not going to be a perfect where all of it works and that's okay. That is part of the fun of it. That's part of getting to do this work, is continuing to improve, but it's hard. It's hard when people, it's hard, especially when you want everyone to think you're so great at everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):
This idea you mentioned of as a senior person solving people's problems, feeling really good, reminds me. Rolling to this, there's this Harvard Business Review article from the '70s or '80s or something about monkeys on your back. Have you read this or heard of this?

Ami Vora (01:05:24):
Oh yeah, yeah, I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:26):
Where it's basically like as a manager, [inaudible 01:05:28]-

Ami Vora (01:05:28):
You're trying to get monkey off of your back on people's backs?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:28):
Exactly.

Ami Vora (01:05:28):
Right, right, right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:32):
People come to you, Ami, here's my monkey, please take it for me and feed it for me and take care of it. And your job as a leader is to keep the monkeys on people's backs and help them figure out how to feed this monkey themself.

Ami Vora (01:05:43):
It's a weird one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):
To get it off their back. It's very visceral. I want to talk about Faire and your current role as a final section of our chat. First of all, what was it like starting something completely new after 15 years at Meta at the various properties of Meta?

Ami Vora (01:06:00):
Yeah, I mean, I was so lucky. I had such an amazing run at Meta. I got to work with amazing leaders, truly great products. And I came to Faire for the same reason that I've been anywhere, because I believe in the people and I believe in the mission. A lot of my family in India is in wholesale and local retail, which is what Faire does, and so it was also a very personal thing for me too. I felt like I knew those customers. I'm a huge fan of small businesses, I got to work with a bunch of them in previous jobs as well.

(01:06:30):
I would say coming to Faire, I mean, one of the things I always think about is that especially as you are more senior, ramping on anywhere feels terrible because you expect to be as good at your new job as you were when you left your last job, but you forget that at your last job, you were there for years, you had years to build up the vocabulary and the cultural context and the network and the product knowledge, and then you're stepping in somewhere where you know none of that, but you have the same expectations of yourself of being able to have an impact and improve things and help your team. And so I always just try to remind myself, it's going to take time and what's most important is not for me to try to come in and change everything immediately, but to learn enough to be able to change things like 60 or 90 or 120 days in the future. And so that breathing helps a little bit.

(01:07:29):
It was also really interesting because Faire was entirely new to me. It was a new business model, it was a whole new set of people. It was a whole new set of customer problems. And so every interaction I just had to learn so much. I had to learn, who is this person? How do they see the world? What's the problem they're talking to me about? What's the customer impact, I think? So it was just a dramatic learning curve, which I always really love.

(01:07:54):
Maybe the last thing I'd say is, again, I was super lucky at Meta. I think I always had this maybe deep-seated insecurity that maybe I was only good at Meta. Maybe there was something about that network of people and how great they were and how well I knew those products, and maybe I wouldn't be that successful somewhere without that scaffolding. And so leaving and being able to go somewhere else and lead through change and a new place, a new customer set, a new business model, that's also been really, really affirming for me, honestly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:34):
Well, you have a lot of fans at Faire from the people I know there.

Ami Vora (01:08:36):
[inaudible 01:08:36].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):
And so clearly, things are going well, at least as far as I can tell. Something that I think is, Faire definitely has, and a lot of companies have, is a very product minded visionary founder. And CPOs classically last a year or two, and then they're like, ah, this sucks. The founder just tells me what to do and what's the point of this role? And it's so frustrating. I'm curious just what you've learned about, at least so far, about working with someone like that as a CPO and not just being this middle person between what the founder wants to do with the team, this building.

Ami Vora (01:09:09):
Yeah, I mean, this is going to sound so naive, but I literally didn't know how important it was for me to have such a great relationship with the CEO, because I always had great relation, I was lucky, I had great relationships with a lot of people at my previous jobs. I was like, oh, of course it's going to be fine, everyone's going to let me do what I want, whatever. And I think I just got really lucky because Max is an amazing CEO, who's also super growth mindset and super open to talking over ideas, even when they involve a lot of change.

(01:09:42):
So when I was onboarding, one of the things I always like to do is write a list of observations. I go out and talk to, I have one-on-ones with a lot of people, and I write, here's the themes that I'm hearing. Here's what's going well, here's what's not going well. And that's a way for me to both share what I'm seeing and build some credibility and trust that way, but also for people to give me feedback and be like, oh, you're wrong about this, just so I can correct my starting point of knowledge.

(01:10:10):
And with Max, I also wrote a parallel document of hot takes. So once a quarter or so for the first year, I'd write a document that was just like, hey, for sake of provocation, if we wanted to fundamentally change a few things, here's ideas on what we could fundamentally change. And Max, very, very well could have just been like, hey, can you please just run product? That's you're job, can you please do that? And instead, he and the entire rest of the executive team were like, yeah, let's step through these. Let's talk about which of these we should try, let's talk about maybe context you don't have for why these don't make sense or why we don't do these. And that was such a gift because I was able to build such a great relationship, a trusting and complimentary relationship with Max and the rest of the exec team, and also that he took seriously things that he really didn't have to that I have so much respect for that, and I think I got really lucky in just finding a great CEO and exec team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):
Is there anything you learned about this vetting process? Say you're a founder looking for a head of product, A CPO, any advice for how they might vet this person to make sure they are good fit and will last?

Ami Vora (01:11:32):
What I'd say to everyone else is, make sure you just have a mind meld with a CEO. Before you decide to take the job, spend a day together, understand how they think and how they operate, and whether you're going to work together in a way that feels really high fidelity and high trust and you're going to have room. I mean, I'm not a founder by any stretch and so when founders ask me what should I look for in a head of product or CPO, I say something a little bit different, which is, make sure that you really need the level of seniority that you are hiring. I think that a lot of founders think, I need a CPO, I need a VP of product, I need someone who's really senior, when often the founder has a bunch of the vision and knowledge, and what they really need is somebody to build the product. They don't need somebody who's going to scale the team or build systems like they've got enough of that. And so that to me is part of building that complimentary relationship where the founder and CEO know what they need and on the CPO side, they know that they can mind meld enough with the CEO to actually have an impact.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:41):
Last question. You started as an intern in the PR department, I think, at Meta?

Ami Vora (01:12:47):
Oh, I started as a temp, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):
At temp, okay, amazing. And then you ended up leading Facebook ads and then WhatsApp and many other things. Can you share that story of just how you joined and how that happened?

Ami Vora (01:12:59):
Well, I had quit my last job. I knew that what I wanted to do was be involved in all the wild stuff happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 2000s. So I'd quit my last job, I was traveling around the world a little bit. I was living in New York, an extremely blissful lifestyle. I was unemployed, I was doing whatever I wanted. It was some of the best time I've had in my life, and eventually I needed a job, like you do. But it was 2007 and the only place I wanted to work was Facebook. You could hear the way people talked about these products. People would say Facebook is more important than than my car. It's like how I connect with the world. It was such a magical product, and you could hear that.

(01:13:51):
And I knew some people at the company and I convinced one of them to introduce me to everyone at the office. I'd made a trade, I said, I'll buy you a fancy coffee at Coupa Cafe in downtown Palo Alto, and in exchange just introduced me to everyone, everyone you know, take me around the office. So everyone I met, I said, "Hey, I'm Ami, I really want to work here. I'll do whatever you need." And the only call I got back was from the Head of PR, Brandy Barker, who said, "Look, we can't hire you. We didn't interview you. We don't have headcount. You're not really qualified." It was just like 10 reasons. I was like, okay, thank you for calling me. And she said, "But we need a temp to review our press releases, so if you want to come join a temp agency, we'll tell them to send you here." And that's what I did, I moved out to California and I slept on people's couches and eventually they hired me full time and I didn't look back.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:50):
And now you're on Lenny's podcast, what a run. It's interesting, this reminds me of another path to power rule from the Jeffrey PFeffer podcast, of networking is one of the best ways to acquire power in the world. So it's interesting that now that seed has planted in my head. Anyway, just A plug for that other episode also.

(01:15:06):
Ami, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Ami Vora (01:15:13):
Sometimes people ask me who are working in product, what's the one thing they should do to be successful at product? And maybe the thing I would say is, especially as an org scale or a company scales, there's just a lot of distractions that get between you and the customer. And so the one thing that I would just advise everyone to do is just think about the customer, talk to the customer, be an advocate for them. It's such a shortcut to everything else you need to do in order to be successful, but it's so easy for that to get lost when you're thinking about, okay, how do I get alignment on my team? How do I figure out my roadmap? How do I convince people to join the company? There's all these different things, but fundamentally, we're here to create value for the customer. And the closer you can get to that, I always found myself the happiest because I'm building that feedback loop with the customer, but also more successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):
Well, let me actually follow up on this because this is really important and interesting. There's a PM part of my brain of like, okay, but we also got to move some metrics and sometimes that metric isn't going to be moved by, we need to do something specifically for the customer, but it's something that will help the business. Is there anything there of just that balance of like, we need to move over this conversion metric, versus, let's focus fully on what does the customer want and need? Any thoughts there?

Ami Vora (01:16:34):
Yeah, I think we often make things adversarial that are not actually adversarial. It is very rare for customer value to be different than a company value on a long enough time horizon. There might be short-term divergences, but really, to solve, to create value for the customer, you got to be around as a business, otherwise you are creating zero value for the customer. And so I think really, just starting with the, what are the end goals and where does stuff diverge in the very short term versus the medium term versus in the long term? It shouldn't, and really thinking about where you are in the journey and how to place that. That always helps me because our metrics should absolutely be about long-term customer impact. It's very rare if those aren't, and then you're still able to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:26):
It comes back to our chat about metrics and how to do those well.

(01:17:29):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Ami Vora (01:17:32):
Cool, I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:34):
Here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Ami Vora (01:17:39):
The Year of Yes, by Shonda Rhimes. I almost never read nonfiction. I love Shonda Rhimes, made an exception for this one. It's about just saying yes to things and finding your voice when you do feel like you're sometimes the first or the only or the different, and what that feels like. And it was very life-changing for me, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:00):
That's an awesome pick. No one has recommended that one yet. Reminds me of an episode of Matthew Dicks, who has a Ted Talk about saying yes to everything.

Ami Vora (01:18:00):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:07):
He just says, Chris, to say yes to everything and his life is incredibly interesting as a result. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Ami Vora (01:18:17):
I watch a lot of witty workplace comedies from the mid 2000s. So I watch a lot of The Office or 30 Rock reruns. Things are just very comfortable that I already know everything, there's no surprises. I'm not great with new stuff right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:33):
I heard they're bringing back The Office. There's a reboot happening.

Ami Vora (01:18:36):
Oh really? Let's see.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):
Yeah, exactly. Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love, either digital, physical, anything?

Ami Vora (01:18:47):
Maybe a physical product that I really like. I drink a lot of coffee and tea through the day and it's just, I don't know, a calming ritual. And so I have a Fellow's electric kettle, that was my big work from home upgrade. So I have this life for kettle, I have a pour over kit. I have these lovely colorful mugs that I like, that has actually just made my day-to-day a lot better, is just a little feeling of luxury.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):
I love that. I think we have that same kettle. I also drink tea during every episode I have here.

Ami Vora (01:19:19):
Oh, yeah. You know it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):
So we're on the same page. Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family, in work or in life?

Ami Vora (01:19:30):
It is definitely not a motto. I feel like I know people have mottos and I'm so impressed. I'm like, you know what you are, you know what you need. I am not that person, but I have a piece of advice that someone gave me very early in my career. Actually, it was Chamath, he said, "You can either have more energy or less ambition." And I was like, oh, that's a little harsh, but also really true. And I think about that, it's another of my Roman empires. I think about it all the time where I'm like, okay, if I want to have this kind of impact, I'm going to have to do the work, I'm going to have to try new things, I'm going to have to feel uncomfortable, and sometimes I don't want to do those things. I don't want to do all of that work, and then I can't be mad if I'm not having the impact. Those two just have to go together. I also have to get lucky in all these different ways, but the two have to go together and that's been just a good governor, a little bit, of how I think about what I'm putting in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
I love that quote. By the way, if people don't know what you're talking about when you talk about the Roman Empires, there's a meme on TikTok where somebody said that every man thinks about the Roman Empire at least once a week. Right?

Ami Vora (01:20:39):
It's made me think about, what are all the things I think about repeatedly without really having trigger or reason? And there's still a lot. I don't think about the Roman Empire though. That is not one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):
I also don't think about the Roman Empires, something's wrong with me. Okay, final question. You can blame your colleague Barr for this question. He tells me that you are very good at jokes, you tell very good jokes. Do you have a joke that you want to share by any chance?

Ami Vora (01:21:06):
I love jokes. There was a year at Facebook where I posted a joke of the week to the company and they're all terrible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:15):
To the company.

Ami Vora (01:21:19):
Yeah, exactly. All right. Here's my favorite joke.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:22):
Great.

Ami Vora (01:21:24):
Why don't sharks eat clowns?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:26):
Why?

Ami Vora (01:21:27):
Because they taste funny. I'll tell you one more and you can choose one, you can choose which one. All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
No, we're not cutting anything.

Ami Vora (01:21:36):
What did the zero say to the eight?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:38):
What did the zero say to the eight? Something like us. Okay, no, I don't know.

Ami Vora (01:21:43):
Nice belt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):
Nice what?

Ami Vora (01:21:45):
Belt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:46):
Belt. Oh, I got it.

Ami Vora (01:21:51):
[inaudible 01:21:51].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):
I get it, I get it. I'm going to tell you a joke. I just heard a standup share. How do you turn an egg into a vegetable?

Ami Vora (01:22:02):
I feel like if you put a letter on it'll turn into a vegetable name, but I can't think of the letter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):
I love that you're really trying to analyze it and get there because I don't know if it's ever possible to actually get the answer. Okay, so how do you turn an egg into a vegetable? Squash.

Ami Vora (01:22:17):
That is definitely my level of joke, definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
They're like, this is for your kid. Go home and do this joke.

(01:22:24):
Ami, this was everything I hoped it would be. I'm going to read again the goal you had for this podcast, I 100% think we achieved it. To be as authentic as possible and show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I think exactly what this podcast ended up being. Thank you so much for being here.

(01:22:40):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Ami Vora (01:22:46):
Oh, thank you, Lenny. It's been such a pleasure. I write a blog on Substack at amiboard@substack.com. It's called The Hard Parts of Growth, it's just about how even when you're working in great places with great people at great companies, sometimes things are hard and that's normal. And so you can find me there. I do the same, I crosspost to LinkedIn so you can find me there. And how can people be helpful to me? I don't know, just by being great, by being kind and nice and making the world slightly better. Yeah, I think that's what we can all do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):
I love that, and I will link to your Substack in the show notes, so if where people want to check it out, and I'll recommend it. I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to recommend it for my Substack.

Ami Vora (01:23:25):
Thank you, Lenny, so much. This was such a fun conversation. I've really enjoyed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:29):
I loved it. Ami, thank you so much for being here. Bye, everyone.

# Behind the product: Replit | Amjad Masad (co-founder and CEO)

## Transcript

Amjad Masad (00:00:00):
The idea behind Replit is that making software today is very difficult. We want to make it easier. People view this as a developer in their pocket essentially. We have 34 million users globally. There's people everywhere learning to code on Replit, building startups, building personal software, personal tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
For people building products, say, product managers, founders, what skills do you see will matter more, matter less?

Amjad Masad (00:00:27):
Typically, you're bottlenecked where your ideas are not fitting in because they need to be made and they need to be made quickly. Now, you open up that bottleneck. So now actually making things is a lot easier. Actually, you become limited by how fast you can generate ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
I think people are unaware of just how far things have gone.

Amjad Masad (00:00:47):
I could imagine whatever five years from now, someone running a billion-dollar company with zero employees where it's like the support is handled by AI, the development is handled by AI, and you're just building and creating this thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:01):
Man, the future is wild. Today, my guest is Amjad Masad. Amjad is the co-founder of Replit, an AI-powered software development and deployment platform for building and shipping software. It's one of the fastest-growing developer communities and AI products in the world. There's a lot of talk these days about how AI is changing, how products will be built, how product teams are going to operate, which functions will be more and less valuable over time. But I feel like very few people have actually seen what modern AI tools can do and have fully grasped how much you can get done with very little technical skill now and in the future. And so I'm going to do an experiment with this podcast where I'm going to do a series of behind the product episodes where we go deep on important products that product builders should be aware of and should probably start playing with.

(00:01:54):
In our conversation, Amjad does a demo of what you can do with Replit today, which is going to blow your mind. And then we spend most of the conversation talking about the implications of this on the future of product development, on the future of product management, and on the future of startups and founders. It's a very exciting time. It's also a very scary and destabilizing time for a lot of people, and my thinking is the more you are aware of what's possible today and where things are going, the better position you'll be in to thrive in this very wild and crazy future that is coming very fast. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Amjad Masad. Amjad, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Amjad Masad (00:02:46):
It's my pleasure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:47):
I thought it'd be great to start with just having you explain what is Replit? What's the vision? Where is this going? What job does it do for people?

Amjad Masad (00:02:56):
The idea behind Replit is that making software today is very difficult and we want to make it easier. One of the reasons for the difficulty is that it is very fragmented, so you would need to download what's called an IDE. It's basically a code editor. You need to download the runtime, basically Python or JavaScript, need to figure out a package manager to configure your kind of open source packages, and once you've done all of that, you need to figure out how to deploy it, how to share it. So it's a very hard process, and that's one of the ways where people get stuck and never learn how to code because it just feels like this cumbersome IT process.

(00:03:42):
And so the vision for Replit has always been is like, okay, making software is fun, is great, more people should do it, but so for more people to do it, it needs to be easier to do, it needs to be in one place, and it needs to be learnable. It's easier to learn. So that's the product today. It is I think one of the more easier IDEs/ environment/deployment environment on the internet, and I think we make it really easy for people to just jump in even without prior experience of coding, especially now with the new AI products that we built.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:22):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:05:40):
This episode is brought to you by Persona, the adaptable identity platform that helps businesses fight fraud, meet compliance requirements, and build trust. While you're listening to this right now, how do you know that you're really listening to me, Lenny? These days, it's easier than ever for fraudsters to steal PII, faces, and identities. That's where Persona comes in. Persona helps leading companies like LinkedIn, Etsy, and Twilio securely verify individuals and businesses across the world. What sets Persona apart is its configurability. Every company has different needs depending on its industry, use cases, risk tolerance, and user demographics. That's why Persona offers flexible building blocks that allow you to build tailored collection and verification flows that maximize conversion while minimizing risk. Plus Persona's orchestration tools automate your identity process so that you can fight rapidly shifting fraud and meet new waves of regulation. Whether you're a startup or an enterprise business, Persona has a plan for you. Learn more at withpersona.com/lenny. Again, that's withpersona.com/lenny. What's the scale of Replit at this point? How large has this gotten? How many people are using it?

Amjad Masad (00:06:55):
We have 34 million users globally. We have a large global presence. There's people everywhere learning to code on Replit, building startups, building personal software, personal tools or internal tools of the companies. More recently, we've been expanding to companies. We released our kind of B2B package in July, and that's been growing really fast. It's been really fun to see people bring Replit to work as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:25):
Damn, I knew it was popular. I didn't realize it was that large actually. As I was preparing for this podcast episode, there's this tweet that went viral where this guy, Jevin, who I actually know. I know this guy from Canada, he's awesome, tweeted about how his 11-year-old girl built an app in Replit. She just had an idea and she built it. And the best part of it is someone in the... replied to him and they're like, "You have to launch an app. You have to host it somewhere. You have to build a database. You have to deploy it. There's no way to do that." And he's like, "No, that's exactly what Replit did."

Amjad Masad (00:07:59):
Yeah, that's what we do. Everything that commenter was talking about, and he's right. The surprising thing about an 11-year-old building an app is not so much even the coding, it is like all the nonsense around it, and so we just abstract all that away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:19):
I love that and I struggled with that myself when I was an engineer way back in the day.

Amjad Masad (00:08:24):
Oh, you were an engineer. I didn't know that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:26):
I was. I was an engineer for 10 years. I was an engineering manager, and then I jumped ship into product.

Amjad Masad (00:08:31):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:32):
I'm happy I did but I do miss that. I was not an amazing engineer. I was a good enough startup engineer, so this is the kind of stuff that I would've left to use. So we're going to jump into a demo of what this actually looks like. I thought maybe actually before we get into it, there's other tools that people are aware of that help you build stuff. And so to put a finer point on what this does and how it's different from other things, you may have heard of, say, Cursor, it comes up a lot these days, just talk about a little bit about the competitive landscape of who else is out there that helps you build product.

Amjad Masad (00:09:04):
Again, we go back to this idea of end-to-end platform for making software. So that's from writing code all the way to deploying it, and monetizing it and all of that. Now, every step in the process of the software development lifecycle, there are a lot of different tools. So Cursor is a fork of VS Code that's made that has really awesome AI tools, but that's an editor. You still need runtime, you still need a deployment environment. Actually, quite a few users use Cursor in tandem with Replit, because Replit just simplifies the runtime and deployment environment.

(00:09:42):
And so you have products, AI products, different places in the software development lifecycle, but really what differentiates Replit is that we do everything, but also that makes it harder to adopt for certain people. If you're at a big company, it's very easy to bring a new editor and start coding with it. It's quite hard to bring something that's quite opinionated about everything from how the code runs to how the code deploys, but that's the trade-off we're willing to make is like yeah, we're not going to get into the enterprise main software development pipeline, but we want to empower everyone to be able to build software, and that means product managers, designers. We have operations people, sales ops, HR ops. We have lawyers using Replit, and so it is democratizing the act of software engineering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):
Amazing, and that's why you're here. Let's do a demo. While you're pulling it up, you're going to share your screen and show us what this product can do. And the reason I am excited about doing a demo, and this is an experiment, kind of a new type of podcast episode I'm doing where we're diving into specific products and what they can do, I feel like there's so much talk about AI and what it's doing and people keep reading about, oh, AI can do this and AI can do that, and I feel like not many people actually see this stuff in action, especially the most cutting edge stuff. I think people are unaware of just how far things have gone and how much is actually possible, especially when someone that knows what they're doing is using the product. So I'm excited to show people what is actually possible and especially because this is going to impact the future of product management and product teams. So I'll turn that over to you. Give us a demo.

Amjad Masad (00:11:37):
Awesome. So this is Replit's homepage. You can create what's called a Repl, which is a project. We have all sorts of languages. You can pick from really in the hundreds, but most recently, and this is how Replit became a thousand times easier, is you can just describe what you want to make. So you go on this home page, we have this text box, and you can write something like make me a cool app or what have you, but a more descriptive prompt is better.

(00:12:11):
And so I asked RPM at Replit, Aman Mathur who's a fan of the show to tell me what PMs like to build. And so he came up with a prompt. He kind of really crafted a great prompt. So I'm going to put it here. And basically, what we're asking for is we want to build a web application. You can say what stack you want to use or you can leave it up to the AI to decide. Here we're saying build it in Node.js for product managers to track feature requests on a public dashboard. So say I have a product, I'm growing, I have a community, I want that community to engage with building the product. I want them to submit feature requests, vote on them. I want to be able to manage that. So we're talking here about the features of voting system, feature requests.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):
Read a few of them just for folks that aren't watching on YouTube to give them, send some of the stuff in this prompt.

Amjad Masad (00:13:07):
So a feature requests submission, so allowing the users to add features. A voting system, so allowing users for these features, feature requests and status tracking, being able to, it's like a kind of advance style board with columns like planned and progress, so that way the admin can kind of share with the community what they're building. And we want it to be user-friendly design, so make it modern and all of that nice kind of prompty things. And then admin controls for product manager. So as a product manager, I want to be able to really manage this community.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:44):
I love that it builds internal tools too, not just the front end.

Amjad Masad (00:13:47):
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. All right, so we're going to start building. Since this is a pretty big, big prompt, the initial coding might take a while. There's different styles of using Replit agents. I often go with minimalist prompts. That's also how I code as well. I have a vague idea for what I want to build and iterate from there. Other people, product managers like to write PRDs and more descriptive things, and you can do either of those things. The AI now responded and then said, I'll build all of that for you. I'm going to build up the initial prototype and you can tell me how it feels, and then we can make it better from there. The AI is also suggesting, adding comment threads, implementing email notifications, and so I can select those and it's being creative, it's telling me what else I could build, but for now, I'm just going to go with a prototype and then we can assess from there.

(00:14:50):
So as you see, as the prototype is starting, you can see this progress pane where we can watch the AI doing its thing here. It's created a Postgres database. Obviously, when we're building a full-stack application, you need to be able to save things. This is one of the cool things about Replit. We have all these services, storage, database. So now it's coding, it's building the database schema. Now, it's building the home page, and it's actually quite fun and edifying to watch it build this, because you can really start to learn how to structure web apps. And if it runs into a problem and as things get complicated, it might run into a problem and you want to be able to help debug and things like that, it's good to be able to have an idea of what's going on, but it's not necessary. I think a lot of people just don't care about the code and are still able to build things, but we want to make the process transparent. We want to show people exactly what the agent is doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:57):
You're basically sitting there behind an engineer on a computer and just watching them code is what the experience feels like.

Amjad Masad (00:16:04):
Yeah, and actually, the way we built it is it's a multiplayer system. So Replit has real time, what we call multiplier coding, and we reused the multiplayer system to build the agent. So the agent in the code is structured as another user of the platform. So basically, we're both coding together. So I can go into the files here and that's the thing that makes Replit really cool. I think people are familiar with some of the more chat interfaces like v0 and others where it's purely chat, but this is a full IDE where you can go and look at the files and edit them yourself or ask the AI for an explanation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):
What's the limitation of what this can do today? What can't you do? Say you're like, you have zero coding experience, what sorts of products can you not yet build with something like this that might be possible in the future? How far does this take you now?

Amjad Masad (00:17:08):
You can build MVPs. I think you can also start to get some initial users. I think when you start iterating on the product like large iterations, you might run into problems. For example, it's not very good at database migrations, and so we're trying to fix that. So when you're iterating on the product, a lot of the times, you're actually changing the structure of the app and that requires database migrations. And so now it might change the database in a way that creates an error that's unrecoverable. And at that point, you might get stuck, especially if you don't know how to code.

(00:17:56):
Some people will figure it out by going to ChatGPT and Claude and asking questions and I actually am really inspired about how persistent some of our users are, which is really amazing. But I think you'll get an MVP pass, the MVP where it's a product that's working and you need to change and iterate on it. It's still a struggle now, but I expect over the next few months, we'll continue. It's if you think about it's like we're building as you were building, so we're building out the agent so that it can continue getting better as our users are also building their applications.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:40):
Got it. So what I'm hearing is it's really good at building the first version and helping you get to something that you can even have people use. It's not amazing yet evolving from there, using AI to help you make the product better and better and better and iterate.

Amjad Masad (00:18:55):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:55):
But you can get in there if you know how to code and take it from there, right?

Amjad Masad (00:19:00):
Yes or you can hire someone. We have a feature on the site called Bounties where you can hire human coders to kind of help you finish.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):
That's going to be our job for humans. That'll remain for a while.

Amjad Masad (00:19:18):
You know what we want to do? We want to get to a point where the agent can go grab a human when it runs into a problem. I think that would be sick.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:32):
Oh, my God. It's like everything's reversed. I love it. Oh, I think it might be done. Check that out.

Amjad Masad (00:19:38):
Yeah. So now the agent is asking us, is the application running and showing the homepage?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:46):
Like it's confirming.

Amjad Masad (00:19:48):
Yeah, almost asking us to do a QA. I'll just say yes. So it found an error. So there's an error here and it's like there's a dumb warning, "I'm going to fix it." So in the meantime, as it's fixing it, so it can be proactive, right? Because it looks at all the errors and things like that, but in the meantime, we can use it. I just created an account. It's coding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:12):
[inaudible 00:20:12] It's cool.

Amjad Masad (00:20:11):
Let's see how it restart. Okay, we'll wait for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
How long would you say it would take an engineer to build this? A typical engineer?

Amjad Masad (00:20:22):
A few days, I would say to a week. I mean, if you're really good, it might be hours but it probably would take me a few days. I would say I'm like decent engineer, it'll take you a few days.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:40):
And it took how much? 5 to 10 minutes.

Amjad Masad (00:20:43):
Yeah, and it probably cost us something in the sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:50):
Wow, in terms of compute.

Amjad Masad (00:20:52):
In terms of compute, yeah. Probably, I would estimate it like 15 cents or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:58):
Wow. Okay, so here it is.

Amjad Masad (00:21:01):
Here it is. And the agent was like, "Okay, this is looking good, completed it if you want to deploy it." But I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to test it first."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):
And so currently, it's living just locally on your local host.

Amjad Masad (00:21:13):
Yeah. It's not local host, it's on a Replit but yes, it's the equivalent of local host. Because it's really easy, I can even invite you to this session. You can be here with me and so it's all online.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:26):
Got it.

Amjad Masad (00:21:26):
So let's submit a feature. So make the product prettier. That's what a typical user might say. So we have this here, you can upvote it. I guess I can't upvote it because I'm the user that created it, but created another user. You can upvote it. But now we need to be able to move things around as the admin, so I don't know how to log into the admin panel. So I'm going to ask the agent, how do I log into the admin panel? So it might've already built the feature, and it's not exposed in the right way. It'll be able to [inaudible 00:22:08]

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:08):
What I love about just watching you interact with this thing, and just real quick throughout, it feels like an engineer that is behind the scenes building this thing like on Slack and you're just talking to them. They built this thing, they're like, "Check this out, I'm done." And you're like, "Oh, okay, about how do I log into this admin panel?" And they're like, "Okay, here we go."

Amjad Masad (00:22:26):
Yeah. So it says, "Would you like me to help you register account?" So it's creating an account, an admin account for me. So it's not only builds things, it also maintains things. In this case, it's actually doing SQL queries. It's not writing code to create an admin account for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:51):
It's insane. I want to talk about the implications of this on product development and product management and founders, but what we just witnessed is somebody, I know you do have technical abilities, but someone that didn't have to have any technical skill, build a real product that people can use in five minutes that looks good and works, and you could keep making it better by talking to this agent.

Amjad Masad (00:23:17):
I'll tell you from our experience what we're seeing, there's so many products that are empowering developers. It's a very easy calculation to say We're going to make engineers 20% better and we're going to sell it to companies and we're going to take 10% of that value, right? That's why there's so many startups now that are just trying to make engineers a little better. Our calculation is like, well, what if you made everyone developer? What does that look like? And so when we released agent and really made programming a lot easier, what we're seeing is that people, exactly like you said, people view this as a developer in their pocket essentially. What we're hearing from customers is that I'm doing things I would otherwise have to go hire a developer, but also because the activation energy is lower than going to hire developer, whether Upwork or other places, I'm building a lot more ideas that otherwise I wouldn't have built.

(00:24:26):
I think it was it called the javelin's paradox or something like that, which is when the cost of things go down, the total consumption of it goes up, which I'm not sure why they call it a paradox, but the cost of electricity goes down, maybe you would expect that the total spend goes down, but actually total spend goes up because people consume more of it. And so I think that's going to be the case of software. As the costs go down, people will just make a lot more software to improve their lives and to improve their work and start more startups and all of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):
So to follow that thread, what are you seeing inside of startups or even big companies in terms of how folks are already using this knowing this is the worst it will be and it will only become smarter and better these days? How are people actually using this that are say product managers or just non-technical people within startups or bigger companies?

Amjad Masad (00:25:26):
On the SMB side of things, a lot of people are building kind of back office tools. So we have real estate agents that have a lot of data, have a lot of things they want to manage in their business that building a lot of these tools, that they otherwise would have to buy, but typically when you buy, it's actually not exactly what you need. And that's kind of the problem with SaaS, like one size fits all. And so a lot of people are seeing it as sort of a SaaS replacement for in-house tools and things like that. And then when you go to the bigger companies, it's anywhere from prototyping to actually production apps to tools as well. So we've seen product managers build, like I said, like a v1 of an app and actually go out and test it with users. I can't name the company, but there's a public company that have used Replit to test a v1 of an app.

(00:26:35):
And obviously after that sort of works, they take it to the engineers and they're like, "Okay, we built this thing. We think it's a great thing. We test it with some users. Let's go actually put it on the roadmap and build it into the actual product." So you are instead of unblocking product managers from having to need engineers for everything that they want to build so they can really build the v0 or v1 of the product.

(00:27:04):
And that's super empowering for them. We saw it also with marketing departments like SpotHero has a head of marketing that actually can code decently well but use Replit to build these apps, and they built a competitive analysis application that looks at a competitor's pricing and makes sure that they're benchmarked correctly. And so it's a full stack app use database and everything and it runs on a continuous fashion. And we see sales engineers use Replit to spin up prototypes really quickly. So actually someone at X, formerly Twitter is on the partner engineering side of things, and he uses Replit agent to spin up applications and prototypes for customers to see how they can use the X API.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):
I love this. I love these examples. By the way, the demo, is there anything else you want to share about the demo before we close that out?

Amjad Masad (00:28:14):
So it created an admin account. We can ask it with the username, password and kind of go into it and manage it but basically that's it. The app's complete in terms of what we ask for. We can send it out. I can give you a URL. Let's actually just deploy it really quickly to show people how you can deploy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:35):
Maybe the show notes, we'll link to the app, you could check it out.

Amjad Masad (00:28:38):
Sounds good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:38):
Okay, cool. That's amazing. So this is deploying it onto some cloud provider. I don't know what you use, but...

Amjad Masad (00:28:44):
We use Google Cloud. So we abstract all of that away from you, but we use Google Cloud behind the scenes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:52):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date.

(00:29:26):
With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2 to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. Let's go down this thread actually while this is happening, just like what allows for this to be possible technology wise? What is the stack? Whatever you can share that enables this to exist.

Amjad Masad (00:30:26):
Yeah, for sure. First of all, it's all the abstractions that we built. So the way a Replit works is the very bottom layer. It's our runtime. So this is the operating system, this is the package manager, this is the language runtimes. We built a system that is able to install packages in any language, including native packages. So the AI, anytime, it needs a package. I can go here and show one of those. By the way, the AI can take screenshots as well so that it checks it works. So here you can see it is taking screenshots to make sure that the homepage is rendering. Here, you can see it wanted a drag and drop library, and so it installed that. And so it has access to all the packages across all languages, including Linux and all of that. And then the layer on top of that is the editor and the infrastructure that runs the editor, including what I described as the multiplayer editor.

(00:31:33):
And then we expose all of that infrastructure to the AI. And there's almost like a new discipline called AI Computer interfaces. So sort of like HCI is now a ACI and turns out LLMs need interfaces that are actually quite different than humans. They're trying to make them use human interfaces like Anthropic's computer use, but those are really expensive and you need to process all this images and video. So instead, for the shell for example, we give it sort of a text representation of what the shell is doing at a certain increments for package installation. We give it a certain tool for editing. We give it an editor tool that when it's writing the code, it's getting feedback on whether there are errors or not, similar to what a human sees, but it's actually old text just to make it easier. So that's AI computer interface, and obviously, all of that is sitting on foundation models. So the improvement in foundation models has allowed us to build this.

(00:32:51):
The most important model that we use is the Sonnet model from Claude, from Anthropic, and it is the best model at coding. So that's the model we use for coding, but we use models from OpenAI as well because a multi-agent system. And so we have models that are critiquing. We have manager editor model, and we have a critique model and different models will have different powers. We also train some of our models, like the embedding model for search is something we trained internally. So I actually wrote about it back in '22. I said it's going to be society of models, like products will be made of a lot of different models, and it's quite a heavy engineering project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:47):
To say the least. We were talking offline and you said you've been working on this since 2009 when you first built the first idea of Replit. Is that right?

Amjad Masad (00:33:56):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):
Oh, my God.

Amjad Masad (00:33:58):
Here's the deployed app. I can send it to you and you can use it and you can see my request even on the logged out page so I can register, upload it, and log in as admin and move things around. We can see what's in progress, what's completed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:14):
This looks like a product. I could see designers spending days designing, passing it to engineering, PMs, having feedback, engineers taking a few days to build it.

Amjad Masad (00:34:26):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:27):
And here's just a prompt, here's what I want.

Amjad Masad (00:34:30):
That's right. And we can iterate on it very easily. We can also iterate on the UI. We can say, I don't like this or that, and it'll do a good job. So we can go here, we can start a new session or a new session to create an entirely new feature here, and it'll just do the right thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:47):
And it builds from that code base. It understands here's what you've built. I want to add this thing.

Amjad Masad (00:34:52):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:52):
Okay.

Amjad Masad (00:34:53):
And that becomes your history, right? This was the v1 and now I'm working on this new feature, and it's almost like what engineers do in Git commit messages. By the way, it generates Git commit messages for everything that it does so you can roll back as well. And so we're trying to make it so that yes, it's for everyone, but we're trying not to abstract too much away. We want to build tools for you to learn to use. And so we want power users to be able to understand the full power of Replit and it is really deep product. I think you can spend a couple of years to kind of master it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:40):
I want to talk about implications, but I want to come back to something you mentioned that is incredible that people may have missed. You basically built a computer specifically designed for the AI agent to use that is a different version of a computer specifically optimized for how AI wants to use a computer.

Amjad Masad (00:36:00):
Yeah. So there's an entire discipline called like HCI, right? It's like how do you do that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:07):
Human-computer interaction.

Amjad Masad (00:36:08):
Yeah. So now there are papers about AI computer interfaces and interactions. And so large language models are trained on large stacks of corpus from the internet, but they're still kind of alien creatures. So they're not like humans, so they have different behaviors. It's unclear what's the best way to give it an editor. So there's so many experimentation about what's the best way to give it a view on what's editing, how many files can you show it before it starts to hallucinate. And right now, it's more of an art than science, but it's becoming more and more like a science.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:55):
This is insane. So it's a simple way to think about it. There's this foundational model, here's what I want you to build, and here's a computer to use to build it.

Amjad Masad (00:37:05):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:05):
How am I [inaudible 00:37:07]

Amjad Masad (00:37:06):
Here's a computer with a set of tools. Here's a tool to install a package. Here's a tool to edit the code. Here's the tool to run a SQL query and also services. Here's a bunch of services you can graph from. Here's a database service, here's an object source service, here's an auth service. So you can think about it as a bunch of external services, the computer with a bunch of tools, and they're all interfacing with the foundation model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):
It's funny listening to this how, it starts to feel like the fact that we might be living in a simulation is not as far-fetched as it may feel. Like this feels like the beginnings of what a simulation computer would be.

Amjad Masad (00:37:50):
Yes. You can go really Sci-Fi on this and it's like where is it headed, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):
Yeah.

Amjad Masad (00:38:03):
If we give it enough tools, let's say, I can drop it in Slack and instead of interfacing with it in this fashion, I want to interface with it in a totally autonomous way. So we actually have this feature coming up where instead of me testing it, we give it another agent. So here, instead of me interfacing with it and saying this is running or not running, we can give it another agent that is actually testing the application and then let's say interface with it entirely through Slack. And I'll say something like, give me Taylor Swift tickets the moment they land.

(00:38:49):
And so it'll build an app that continuously monitors the web for when Taylor Swift tickets land and there's an agent that's using the app to be able to get that. And you can imagine it has some kind of wallet or credit card. And then the moment it lands, it gets it. What I'm trying to say is that software, like agents being able to do software, is how AI gets more general because software runs our lives, runs the internet, runs our businesses. And so the more competent AI becomes that software, the more general they are in terms of what they can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:36):
Okay, this can go in so many directions. I'm going to bring us back to the implications for people building products, say, product managers, founders, how does this change, that function, that skill set? What skills do you see will matter more matter less? Which functions are maybe in some danger and they should start thinking about a different career path?

Amjad Masad (00:39:59):
One interesting persona that we're seeing is the CEO, the CEO of startup. Andrew Wilkinson from Tiny is a big user. And so these people are typically creatives. They built a company, they hired people. A lot of them can't code. A lot of them are designers or product managers or something else. And you can imagine a bottleneck, you can imagine a bunch of ideas in their head, and the ideas have to translate through them talking. And then someone else listening to them and assuming that someone else actually understands what they say, and then that's someone else going and trying to build what they want to build. And also assuming that person has time, because a lot of times, your engineers are kind of stuck building the current thing. They're not thinking about the future thing. And so what gets me excited is a lot of these CEOs are building the future concept, the next product they're going to build, the next, say, company they're going to build.

(00:41:08):
And so it unlocks the creativity and again, sort of unblocks them from that. And look, it's a v1 of the product but it can push things forward. You can touch it, you can feel it, you can say, okay, this really has lags and we should work on it. You give it to your engineers and they can improve on it from there. So that's one persona but I'm really excited about it, the CEO/founder. In companies, one of the things that I think is sort of hard about tech companies is these silos between designers, product managers, and engineers. And everyone feels that pain of, we have low bandwidth communication, which is language and then text on Slack and Zoom calls. And it leads to a lot of frustration, because it's really easy to misinterpret people and again, leads to siloing where people working on something, and then you pass it on to the next team and it's not really what they expect.

(00:42:30):
That happens a lot between designers and engineers, but the common language that everyone shares is code. Ultimately in software tech companies, everything that we're talking about need to eventually flush out in terms of code. And so what if the language becomes actually working prototypes and working applications? For example, we have a Figma extension that translate Figma mocks into React that runs on Replit. So instead of giving the engineers just mocks or screenshots, whatever, you just say, oh, here's a bunch of React code, just make sure it runs on our infrastructure but don't mess with it, don't move the pixels around. And so I think it just opens up silos of the companies, make communication around product a lot more concrete, because I can give you a working prototype and that'll change how people work, if you can imagine that everyone can make software. It's really kind of a radical reimagining of not just what tech companies are but really what most companies are because everyone can be more general.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:04):
So say you're a PM listening to this, an engineer or designer, what skills do you think if you were one of these folks? If you were in building Replit right now, what kind of skills would you suggest folks focus on more and would you think are just like, okay, this can be less valuable in the future, don't worry about these sorts of things? And you can either pick one of those three functions or all three.

Amjad Masad (00:44:25):
I think a very important scale that's perhaps harder to develop but it's worth working on is being generative, being more generative, being able to generate new ideas quickly, because you can think about it as a factory line. So you have ideas, you have the production of these ideas or the initial production of these ideas, and then you have other people that want to consume these ideas or work with you on these ideas. And so typically you're bottlenecked by the middle part where your ideas are kind of like they're a lot of them and they're not fitting in, because they need to be made and they need to be made quickly. And so now you open up that bottleneck. So now actually making things is a lot easier. Actually, you become limited by how fast you can generate ideas, and I find that true of myself as well. I consider myself quite generative, but now I have this tool and I can build a lot more and explore a lot more and I'm finding that, well, actually, I'm running out of ideas sometimes.

(00:45:53):
So training that muscle I think is a good thing. I think learning a little bit of coding and not the traditional way of learning coding. If you go to a coding bootcamp, they're going to start with what is Git? Actually my co-founder, Haya, was a designer. When we're first building the Replit together, she went to WebAssembly to do a coding course. And the first day, they spent this whole time on Git and she's like, "What is that? What does it do?" I still don't know what it exactly does, but it's like you're inverting the process, you're giving the tool before the actual problem. And so I think all of that stuff, you don't have to worry about, so things that you don't have to worry about. I think a lot of the, as a PM, as a designer, as someone who's not in your code editor every day, don't worry about all the tooling.

(00:47:09):
And if you learn a little bit of coding just by talking to an AI, doing a little bit of debugging, building something with Replit, running into a problem and trying to fix it just using AI, you'll learn a bit of coding. And I have this that's been called not by me, dubbed as Amjad's Law, which is the return on investment for learn to code is doubling every six months. And really just learning a little bit of that skill, learning a bit of skill about how to prompt AI, how to read code, and be able to debug it. Every six months, that's netting you more and more power because you're going to be able to create a lot more. It's going to be easier to create. You're going to be able to create a lot more complete things. So that's another skill that I think could be necessary.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:15):
This is super interesting. Okay, so this last point, you made Amjad's Law. It's interesting because when people, as someone's listening to this, I could see them being like, engineers are in trouble. Why do you need engineers at this point? These agents are building the code. Your point is specific engineering skills are going to be incredibly valuable and more and more. How often are they doubling would you say? Every year you said?

Amjad Masad (00:48:40):
No, every six months.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:41):
Every six months, these specific engineering skills are becoming more valuable. And the idea is you don't need to know everything. You don't need to know the foundation, to build the app as much. It's more to unblock the agent and understand the mental model of how this stuff is built so that you can move forward fast.

Amjad Masad (00:48:59):
That's right. That's right. Understanding the basic components of it, I would say, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:03):
Yeah, so it's like we need new engineering schools to teach you these very specific skills versus spending years on algorithms.

Amjad Masad (00:49:11):
And I think no one has done that yet, and I think this is a big business probably ready to get built. It's like AI native coding. It's totally different than traditional coding. That's why on Hacker News, there's so much skepticism about AI native coding tools, because they're like yeah, it's a glorified autocomplete. And I understand if you're writing operating system, kernels, it's not really doing that much for you, but if you're building products, it's building it for you at this point. And so if you're starting a school to teach AI native coding, you would skip so much of computer science and the basic tools, and you would teach the basic idea of how to structure an app, and then you would teach prompting and then you would teach, I think a little bit of debugging. I think debugging is quite a good skill right now to learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:22):
Interestingly, if you want to be good at debugging, there's a lot you need to understand, which is basically what you're saying is that's the subset of things to understand is things that break. And to do that, you have to understand how it all works. What are servers? What are APIs? All these things. Okay, so we've been talking about how this is very good right now, building a prototype, building a v1, MVP, people can use it, you can deploy it. You deploy this app, people can start using it, and there's a scale it can reach. Do you see a future where you can build a Salesforce sized business fully Replit or other tools that can scale to hundreds of billions of dollars of value? Or is there just going to always be some limit of like, you need actual engineers and designers sitting on this thing, building it, thinking it? Awesome.

Amjad Masad (00:51:06):
If my law is directionally correct, even if the months are not, I'm not exactly right that the duration is correct, you're going to see a compounding effect of the power. It's actually quite hard to convince yourself. But if you really convince yourself that we are on a massive scale of improvement in AI, then the answer is yes. And it's absurd to my engineering mind that I'm saying it is, but know Ray Kurzweil, this futurist talks about how exponentials are really hard for humans to grasp. And so actually when we started building the agent, I told the team, it's easy and we fall in this trap before. It's easy to build and optimize for today. In '22, we built Copilot-like thing and autocomplete. We train our own models, we optimize the hell out of them. But at some point, that modality was kind of not the right modality, which is the autocomplete modality.

(00:52:11):
And the right modality is actually this, I think for now, as being able to chat inside the programming environment and for the agent to create things for you. But in order for us to make that bat, a year ago the models were actually not there. The models could not do this, but we were like, okay, we're going to build for the models that are landing in six months. And truly six months later, the model started to land that are capable of this, of the reasoning that we needed and whatever. And so that was like saw it if you want, which is, oh, wow, we switched to it and the reasoning improved so much. And six months later, you have a son of you too. And so it's really almost like a six months cadence. And so if we're really on this trajectory, then I would say next year, you're able to just scale and maybe you get thousands of users paying you.

(00:53:08):
The AI can do maintenance. We already showed the AI doing SQL queries and doing migrations, so I will be able to do maintenance, debugging, things like that. I think where it gets really tough is that when you're hitting scale and you want to architect a system that is resilient, and so that means you would start sharding databases and you would start using different queue systems and components and things like that. And I think the AI needs to have access to the entire suite of tools to be able to do this.

(00:53:49):
And I think that's going to be the next bottleneck. And I think the AI needs to be a lot more reliable at doing that. But I could imagine whatever, five years from now, someone running a billion dollar company with zero employees where it's like the support is handled by AI, the development is handled by AI, and you're just building and creating this thing that people are finding valuable and are paying you for it. That being said, it's worth thinking about the economics of it. If the cost of software goes down a lot, then what is the price that you can charge on software? So can you actually build the next Salesforce if anyone can generate Salesforce? And then the question is, and this is why I emphasize being generative, because I think then the thing that will make you better is by being able to iterate and improve the thing really quickly and generate new ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:01):
And stay ahead of all the other people building these tools so quickly. Oh, my God. An interesting other kind of mental model I'm seeing as you talk about this sort of thing is not to offend religious folks, but there's this concept of God of the gaps. I imagine you've heard that where it's like God explains all the things that we don't yet understand. And over time that kind of space shrinks and God's like all the things we don't get yet, those gaps. That was God that proves there needs to be a God. And it feels like right now, humans are the gaps in these tools or these agents you talk about that you can hire within Replit are fixing these little gaps. And over time, AI will fix these things themselves.

Amjad Masad (00:55:44):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):
And these gaps will shrink.

Amjad Masad (00:55:47):
Unless we hit some fundamental limit and the current regime of AI, which I'm not an expert about how far transformers could scale, but I feel like we found the thing that could scale pretty far, but maybe there are limitations in data or other things like that that we could be surprised by. But if there isn't, then we are on a massive trajectory of removing these gaps quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:23):
Yeah, very true. We have no idea. We keep thinking it's just going to keep going, but maybe it'll stop at some point. I could keep going and going, but I think we should also let people go play with these things and process all the things we've been talking about. Is there anything else that you think might be helpful for folks to think about or learn or study?

Amjad Masad (00:56:43):
I'll give advice to founders or leaders at companies. The way we work is going to change rapidly, and it's important to be resilient to that change. One thing that I think is really difficult now is having roadmaps, especially if you're doing anything in AI, but really anything that AI could affect, you want to be able to react to it really quickly. And so when the Anthropic drop the computer use set of capability, we slaughtered our roadmap because we don't really have an explicit roadmap. We immediately jumped on it and started building things and we launched some things around it. We're going to be doing more with it, but there's going to be capabilities that are going to drop. And you want to really, in some cases, if it really affects your business, you want to be able to jump on it really, really quickly. So being agile, not being stuck with roadmaps, being able to just say, oh, we're just going to switch priorities right away, is going to be super important.

(00:57:59):
Not being, like I said, with silos at Replit, there's so many people that are on the scale of designer to engineer, designer, product manager. Actually, I mentioned Amman earlier. He started as a designer at Replit, and now as a product manager. We have people who start as designers, become engineers, and we have people in the middle and we're comfortable with that design engineers that fit at different parts of the scale. And the design engineers go to the design correct meetings and some designers go to the engineering meetings. You got to be fluid because again, when designers can code and engineers can design, I mean it really becomes, you can't have a lot of structure around that. So you want to build a culture and you want to build an environment or milieu that is really, really flexible, which is uncomfortable for a lot of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:03):
Man, the future is wild. Everyone's a hybrid person now. Let me just actually double down on what you just said, which I think is really interesting. It's almost like if you're an engineer, where your skill set will become most valuable is unblocking these AI tools and knowing debugging and figuring out how to allow it to go further and further and further. Within PM and design land, based on what you're describing, where the skills will become more valuable is generating ideas, almost like finding opportunities, discovery, finding what problems need to be solved, and then articulating that as clearly as possible to the AI tooling.

Amjad Masad (00:59:44):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:45):
Super interesting.

Amjad Masad (00:59:45):
Yeah, this is a very crisp sort of advice that people can follow today, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:50):
Oh man, what a world. Okay, I'm jot. This is incredible. My mind is racing. I've got to go build some apps immediately.

Amjad Masad (00:59:58):
Yes, you've back. Love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:00):
I will do that. So just to leave listeners with a couple things. One is just, what should they know? Where do they find you? How do they try Replit? Anything else other than just go to replit.com?

Amjad Masad (01:00:10):
Yeah, just go to replit.com. It's an open beta right now. We're kind of quickly improving and going to exit beta I think in a few weeks. But if you're comfortable testing something that's not perfect, go to replit.com. If you subscribe to our core plan, you should be able to access the agent and start using it. And we are, I think the place where we're most active is Twitter. So Twitter are like X, the handle Replit, R-E-P-L-I-T or my handle @amasad.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
Oh, yeah. One other thing I wanted to make sure we had a chance to touch on is you're working on something new, something that's coming in the very new future, maybe the day this episode drops. Talk about that.

Amjad Masad (01:00:56):
All right. So depending on when the episode is coming out, this could be the first time people hear about it. But we have this product called agent. It is sort of high agency, does everything from setting up the project and all of that. And so now, we are working on assistant. Assistant is let's say the cousin of agent. It is a little less powerful but a lot more controllable. You can focus on features or areas of the code that you want to change and you still don't have to know how to code, but it is a lot more manageable and it is a lot faster.

(01:01:38):
So you saw how it took some time to kind of create the project and code some of the things. Assistant is in the order of milliseconds and seconds to be able to respond to you. And so again, as I talk about the idea of tools, we want people to have as much power and autonomy as possible. And so there are certain instances where agent is the best. It's going to do the debugging for you, it's going to create the database for you. But if you want more control, assistant is going to give you that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:09):
Just so folks totally understand what this is going to do for them. What's the mental model for what this is? If it's like a person, we're helping you out.

Amjad Masad (01:02:17):
Agent is like having a developer work. You give them the PRD, right? And they're going to go and build the thing. Assistant is like you're sitting next to them. So they built the thing and now you walk over to their desk and you say, let me move this button. Three pixels to the left. Let me change this thing. So small increments of changes that you want happen really quickly and you want it reliably, that will give you that. So it's just much faster iteration on UI and things like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Incredible. The future is wild. Final question I always ask everybody, how can listeners be useful to you?

Amjad Masad (01:03:04):
Come work at Replit. We have a PM role. I think up if you're product manager. We're hiring engineers and product managers. So come work at Replit or refer someone to Replit, especially if you're like our tools and you want them to get better. The best way to do that is to get us great people we can hire.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:25):
Well, you're about to get a flood of product managers applying. Goodluck.

Amjad Masad (01:03:28):
Amazing. I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:30):

## Transcript

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:00):
You don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, "I'm going to make the next great AI company," I think that is the equivalent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than maybe anyone else in the world. What is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:20):
Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote.

Speaker 3 (00:00:24):
Fish where the fish are.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:26):
The biggest mistakes I've made have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:34):
It's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:00:38):
It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7. So many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively. I think the fundamental question is, do all jobs just become a single prompt?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today, my guest is Andrew Wilkinson. Andrew is the co-founder and CEO of Tiny, a holding company that's often called the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet. They own over 40 businesses ranging from Dribble to WeCommerce to the AeroPress coffee maker, and they focused on buying profitable businesses from founders and holding them for the long term. Andrew and his co-founder bootstrapped the business from zero to hundreds of millions of dollars in value, and Andrew personally was worth over $1 billion at one point. In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover a bunch of strategies for coming up with a good business idea, what common business ideas you should avoid, his experience automating much of his work and life using AI, and what that means for employment in the near future. Also, what he's learned about happiness and money and how they're not directly related, and also how getting diagnosed with ADHD and then taking SSRIs was the thing that most impacted his happiness in life.

(00:01:46):
This is both a powerful and also a very tactically useful conversation and I'm really excited for you to hear it.

Check it out at Lenny's newsletter.com and click bundle. With that, I bring you Andrew Wilkinson. This episode is brought to you by Sauce. The way teams turn feedback into product impact is stuck in the past, vague reports, static taxonomies, unactionable insights that don't move business metrics. The result, churn, lost deals, misgrowth. Sauce is the AI product copilot that helps CPOs and product teams uncover business impact and act faster. It listens to your sales calls, support tickets, churn reasons, and lost deals, surfacing the biggest product issues and opportunities in real time.

(00:02:41):
It then routes them to the right teams to turn signals into PRDs, prototypes, and even code that drives revenue retention and adoption. That's why Whatnot, Linktree, Incident.io and Zip use Sauce one enterprise uncovered a product gap that unlocked $16 million ARR, another caught a issue and prevented millions in churn. You can too at sauce.app/lenny. Sauce built for AI product teams, don't get left behind.

(00:03:10):
This episode is brought to you by Enterpret. Enterpret is a customer intelligence platform used by a leading CXN product orgs like Canva, Notion, Perplexity, Strava, Hinge, and Linear to leverage the voice of the customer and build best-in-class products. Enterpret unifies all customer conversations in real time, from Gong recordings to Zendesk, tickets to Twitter threads, and makes it available for your team for analysis and for action. What makes Enterpret unique is its ability to build and update a customer-specific knowledge graph that provides the most granular and accurate categorization of all customer feedback and connects that customer feedback to critical metrics like revenue and CSAT. If modernizing your voice of customer program to a generational upgrade is a 2025 priority, like customer-centric industry leaders like Canva, Notion, Perplexity, and Linear, reach out to the team at enterpret.com/lenny.

(00:04:12):
Andrew, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:04:15):
Oh, thanks man, great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):
I've been wanting to chat with you for so long. There's so much that I want to talk about and I want to start with a topic that I know that you think a lot about and that it's also in the minds of a lot of people, which is coming up with a great startup idea and this is something that a lot of people are thinking about right now because AI makes it so easy to actually build your idea into something real, and I feel like this is something you spent a lot of time thinking about. I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than, I don't know, maybe anyone else in the world. I feel like you're in the top a hundred, top 10, something like that. I don't know. Does that feel right?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:04:51):
I've definitely had a lot of experiences and I've probably started or been involved with 75 different projects or businesses where I've been a primary contributor and I wouldn't say that's anything to brag about because I've been an inch deep in a mile wide. So that's been in a lot of ways kind of my Achilles heel is I get too excited about ideas and I start too many businesses, but as a result I've seen almost every business model under the sun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:18):
Amazing. Okay. Yeah, I think the benefit is for us is we get to learn from your experience. Let me just ask you this question, what is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:05:28):
Ultimately the best thing is something you're going to be interested in, but I think a mistake a lot of people make is they choose something that everybody is interested in. So for example, they say I don't know anyone that has hadn't had the thought, man, I would love to start a really cool restaurant or I want to have a cool cafe or something. And in reality, what they think about is how cool would it be to come up with an amazing logo or all fun stuff, design the menu and stuff. But in reality, operating those businesses is miserable and it's also a very hard business because every morning millions of people wake up and they go, I should start a cafe. But on the flip side, almost nobody wakes up every morning and says, "You know what? I'd love to start a funeral home," or "I would like to start a pest control business," or "I should start software that helps people fill out forms for the government."

(00:06:26):
And Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote. He says, "Fish where the fish are." And he gives this example, he says, "If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen and they're all elbowing each other out of the way. They're all using the best lures, the best fishing line, they all have amazing strategy. You actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition. And I think that's probably the most important thing in business is actually to find those niches where you can actually make real money because competition equals lower margin. The more competitors there are, the lower your prices have to be and the more competitive the business is ultimately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:19):
It doesn't feel intuitive to go after small markets and to find niches. So let's just follow that thread. Well, why is that actually a source of some of the best ideas starting really small and niche?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:07:30):
I don't necessarily think it has to be something that is small forever, but it has to be something that like I think about if you're a first time entrepreneur or a student or something, you don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, "I'm going to make the next great AI company," or "I'm going to launch a new bank," or something like that, something that is very, very rigorous and complicated and highly competitive and regulated, I think that is the equivalent. I think you really want to take the baby weights and start slowly building your muscle. And I think about my own experience starting a business, I was so lucky because the first business I ever started my web design agency, which became Metalab, that was so easy and it worked immediately because all I had to do was know how to build websites and be able to talk to potential customers.

(00:08:33):
And then once they said, "Yes, I will pay you $5,000," I just had to send them an invoice, do the work, and that was it. It was a very simple business. And because of that, I got immediate positive feedback and I built my own narrative. And my narrative was, "I'm good at business, I can do this, keep going." And then I went off and I started taking my money that I made from that original business and that's when I fucked up. So I went out and I started a pizzeria and I lost all my money. I started a designer cat furniture business, a online DJ school, a skin cream business, all of these things. I've just lost all my money almost immediately, but because I had that first win I kept on going. And I just think it's so critical that people choose a business where they get that initial win.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:22):
Okay, this is a great topic. This is just like how do you avoid creating a job for yourself that you hate? There's a lot of business opportunities and ideas that like, "Yeah, you can make this work," and then it works, and then you're stuck doing this thing running a restaurant. My wife tells a story where a friend started a coffee shop and then he's like, "I thought I was starting a coffee shop, but I'm just replacing milk and buying milk all day. That's my job now." So just kind of along those lines to help people avoid creating a beast that they didn't expect any advice for Just how to know this is maybe even though this may work and make money, you probably don't want to be spending your life doing this sort of business.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:09:59):
So I just started a pressure washing business. I was speaking at a local business school and after I spoke, one of the kids walked up to me and he said, "Hey, I'm an entrepreneur. I've started two or three businesses in the past doing landscaping and I'm not enjoying school." And so just on the spot, I said to him, "Why don't you drop out and we'll start a business together?" And I'd been cooking on this idea of a pressure washing business because I'd studied that industry a little bit and I knew a few friends who'd done it in other cities. And I had this unfair advantage, which is I owned a whole bunch of media properties where I could advertise it for free basically. And so we started this business and I think for him, he kind of had this moment of, do I really want to be washing people's driveways for the rest of my life?

(00:10:47):
And what I said to him is, "Look, if this gets to scale, you'll never touch a pressure washer unless you want to." If the business can get big enough where you can have employees, he can just focus on sales or digital marketing or whatever aspect of the business that he really loves. And I think that's the biggest thing that a lot of entrepreneurs miss. They say, "I don't want to do that for the rest of my life. I don't want to be in the back of a dry cleaner dry cleaning clothes." And to me it's just a question of scale. I think the cafe is a great example because a cafe, if it doesn't get to a reasonable scale is just a job.

(00:11:26):
There's a big difference between a business and a job. I think if you could start a pressure washing business where you're the only employee, yeah, that's a job, but if you can get to a scale where you can drive 10 leads a day, then you don't have to do any of the pressure washing and you just do what you love. So I think a lot of people have this kind of Protestant work ethic where they think, well, I've got to be the person to do everything. And I think they really need to lean into what I call lazy leadership, which is how do I get away from the things I hate as quickly as humanly possible? How do I be Teflon for tasks?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
It's interesting that this business is non-software related at all, this pressure washing business. So I guess just for folks that are coming up with ideas, and I imagine most ideas are there's a pull to make it software oriented, something AI is going to help build for you and help you run. What's your calculus on just going down a direction of real world physical business, like a restaurant power washing business versus a software just like what are the benefits of that direction when should someone actually seriously think about doing a business like a power washing business?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:12:30):
I think if someone's listening to this podcast, odds are they're someone who's kind of a digital native. And I think the question is, what's your unfair advantage and what are you great at? So for me, I think I have reasonably good taste. And so what I could do is I identify and I knew enough to identify great design and development talent, but mostly I was lucky because I was a talker. I was good at meeting with clients and selling myself. And so ultimately my highest and best use my superpower was sales. And so that can be applied to anything, anything where you need to go out and you need to sell a customer. And so really it just comes down to what do you get drawn to and then how do you find the profitable business within that? So here's an example. A friend of mine, he owns a restaurant and he said, "Oh, I love it. I'm so passionate about it. It's this stunning beautiful restaurant in my hometown."

(00:13:32):
And he said, "But it's really just a job for a few different people and we can't make any money at it, but I've been noticing that there's all these vendors that service the restaurant and those guys are making a killing." And so he told me about a business that cleans grease traps, another one that cleans exhaust vents for kitchens. So I think looking around and seeing where your passion is and then sniffing around within it, probably somewhere within your passion, there's an opportunity. So for example, I love movies. My happy place is a dark theater. That's the best way for me to de-stress is go to a dark theater and watch a movie and get lost in it. And probably about four or five years ago, I was like, "Man, how cool would it be to invest in movies in some way to be a part of that creative world?"

(00:14:26):
And so I started looking into funding movies and I realized that when you fund movies, like 90% of the time you lose all your money. And even if you do make some money, you rarely make a good return. But I spend a bunch of time understanding the industry and learning about it. And then two years ago I was in New Zealand and I met the founder of Letterboxd and I realized, "Oh my God, this is a business where this has a moat, so it has a network effect, it's a huge social network for film reviewers. It's something I'm passionate about and it's something that we can buy at a fair price." All those things came together and I was like, "Oh my god, I can invest in film now." In the same way I used to be a barista, we ended up buying the AeroPress coffee maker company. So I follow my passions and spend a long time learning different industries and then I find the profitable niche within.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):
Okay, and this is a great takeaway essentially when you're thinking about startup ideas, make sure there's some connection to something unique to you where you have some unfair advantage. This makes me think about Brian Armstrong. I saw him do a talk once and he gave this really amazing insight about why Coinbase did well and why he started Coinbase. And it's because if you look at his background, he had this really rare Venn diagram of background of computer science and I think it was cryptography and economics, which is the exact set of skills you need to start something like Coinbase. So I think the tip there is just what is that unique Venn diagram of skills in your background and just ideally what you're building connects to that and gives you an unfair advantage.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:16:02):
Well, yeah. I just met another UVic student at the local university student. She is interested in marketing and so she's gone out and she's found some local clients, so small restaurants and stuff and managed their social media and she said, "Yeah, it's okay. I can make a thousand bucks a month, but it's a lot of work," and the owners really want a lot for their money. And I said, "Well, if you just pivot that idea just ever so slightly, and instead of doing restaurants, you did realtors or wealth managers who have quite a large marketing budget and are used to spending serious money and it only has to work a little bit to make a lot of money for them. Those people, you can charge $5,000 a month."

(00:16:44):
So I think often it's you find your passion, your skill set, you zero in, and then you just kind of pivot and you find the most profitable way to do it. When I started my web design firm, I started mostly with local and small projects, but very quickly I found a job board in San Francisco where startups would share projects they needed help with. I could charge five times the amount for five times less work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:09):
This point about fish where the fish are I think is really important. You can start something that's awesome that you love, that you're so excited about, but nobody needs it. Talk a bit more about just what that looks like. What have you seen when you're thinking about ideas that tell you that there's fish but also not overfished as you pointed out?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:17:25):
I think it's hard like Warren Buffett has this great quote, "I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman." And I feel like in order to know what problems are valuable to solve, you kind of need to have valuable problems. So it's a bit of a hard thing because I remember when I was like 20, I would say, I hate how all the cat furniture I can buy for my cats is I bet people would pay a lot of money to solve this, but I didn't understand anything about the realities of that business model. I didn't understand how little people were actually willing to pay. I didn't have a enough life experience to go, "Yes, that's actually a worthwhile opportunity." And I think that being able to know what people would pay to solve the problem realistically is incredibly valuable.

(00:18:20):
So my example of a realtor selling a house, because I've studied that industry, I know that a realtor can make like 20 to $50,000 selling a single house. So I can intuit that they'd be willing to spend a lot of money if I have a unique way of getting them clients that'll buy houses that'll convert at a high conversion rate that is worth $5,000 a lead maybe, right? So I think you kind of have to understand the problem in depth before you really know. Because when I was starting out, I would go down every rabbit trail, every infomercial idea I had I would think was genius.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):
Or people, I don't know, that don't have this experience, which is most people. Is there one thing you do, maybe a heuristic that gives you a sense, maybe there's something here, maybe there's a lot of fish, maybe it's a value of prompt or no, the soul tell me it probably isn't.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:19:12):
No, unfortunately, I think it's mostly gut. I mean Munger and Buffett talk about having a whole bunch of mental models in your brain and they form a latticework, right? And they all kind of piece together. And I feel like for me, there's so much of this that is, it's almost like I'm an AI model and I've trained on all this data of what works and what doesn't and what's a good moat and what's a bad business, et cetera. And when I see it, I just immediately know. I mean, I think all entrepreneurs are so lucky now to be able to go into Claude or ChatGPT and just say, "Hey, I'm thinking about starting a Botox clinic. Can you break down the numbers? Is this a good business? What's hard about it? What is the regulatory moat? What would my payroll look like?" I didn't have any of that and so I started so many incredibly stupid businesses, but I think there's no excuse at this point. You should be able to do it with AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):
That's a really good tip actually. Then there's this point you made about boring is good. That's a really good piece of advice. A lot of people are going after flashy stuff, things they condemn on Twitter. Your advice here is boring is actually a really good thing because fewer people are going after it. Is that the general tip?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:20:22):
Totally. I mean, so I started this business, one of my first called Flow and Flow was basically Asana before Asana came out. So it was a way to manage your to-do's and projects with your team in a web app and we basically did the thing. We made the mistake that so many entrepreneurs make, which is to go after an industry that everybody goes after just like cafes. Everybody has the idea, man, I wish I could design my own project management system or my own to-do system. And not only that, but everybody loves new things. They love jumping around. I know me personally, in the last three years, I've probably used three different productivity systems and I love jumping around in them and I didn't understand that and I ended up losing $10 million trying to compete with venture-backed businesses and bootstrapping.

(00:21:17):
It was all my own money, poured $10 million, lit it on fire trying to compete with Asana because I didn't understand how the business world worked really as they had raised hundreds of millions of dollars and they were run by the co-founder of Facebook and it was a little bit like, I'm Fiji and I'm deciding I'm going to invade the United States in retrospect, just completely silly. Now on the flip side, if I'd taken that same amount of energy and I'd instead focused on, let's see, what's a really boring one I've heard about, there was a business I saw recently.

(00:21:52):
They were making $30 million a year and all they did was help people fill out forms to get government assistance in certain programs. So it'd be like your uncle is disabled and you need to access government funding. The process to do it is incredibly time-consuming and miserable and you have to fill out all these forms. They just have software that fills out the forms for you and it says, look, you're going to get $20,000 as a grant, pay us a thousand bucks, and that is such a boring, nobody wakes up and goes, "I want to make form filling software," but I think they would if they could make 20 million a year

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):
Along these lines of just bad ideas, things people shouldn't start, what are a few ideas that you think everyone thinks is going to be a great idea and then they do it and then they always fail?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:22:37):
Well, I think the biggest mistake, I can speak from my own experience, the biggest mistakes I've made business-wise have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better. So for example, me and one of my best friends about 10 years ago, we really wanted to start a bar. We just thought it'd be so cool to have a bar where us and all of our friends could go, we thought it'd be great for the city. We thought we can run this really high margin because we're tech guys, we know how to build systems, we're good at business, and we were utterly humbled. We realized that we didn't know anything about business compared to someone who runs a pizzeria. If you think about it, like my example earlier of if you run a software company, what has to happen?

(00:23:24):
You have to hire a bunch of nerds, they need internet connections and computers and you need to pay them and you need to coordinate online and everyone can work asynchronously. Nothing has to go right. It's not that complicated, at least at small-scale. A pizzeria, it's like if the baker doesn't wake up at three in the morning and start prepping dough, the entire thing is effed and all along the way there's a hundred different failure points from front of house, back of house, the deliveries, arriving on time, all this logistics. And so I think it's been stuff like that. I mean also I got into the news business, the local news business. I ended up buying an old paper in Vancouver and it's the exact same thing. It's like you can't take a brilliant management team and change a bad business model. Ultimately the business model wins.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):
This is really good advice. Basically if there's a bunch of dead bodies in that space, there's probably something there that keeps killing them that you're probably not aware of until maybe somebody figures something out, right? Once in a while, once in a blue moon, someone's like, "Okay, here's how we do this and then it works."

Andrew Wilkinson (00:24:34):
Well, look at Instacart. When Instacart came out, everyone said, "Well, Webvan failed. This is never going to work." And we still don't necessarily know if Instacart is a great business. I don't know, I haven't studied it, but I think it was like, okay, enough technology has changed that it can happen, but would it be easier to start Instacart, Amazon or Coupang or would it be easier to start an enterprise SaaS software company? Definitely the enterprise SaaS software company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
I see. So this is I guess is the advice there. The thing that is easy to start is the thing you should not do because everyone's going after that.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:25:10):
Well, it goes back to my gym analogy of if you're going to deadlift 300 pounds, trained for 15 years, you should have already had three startups and they should have worked and you've really built up the reps. And I think that if I was going to start Instacart, that's different than someone who's 20 starting it. Not that I would be good at it, but at least I would know what I'm getting into.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):
Let's talk about something that is this endless debate on Twitter. Maybe it's a false dichotomy between lifestyle businesses, bootstrap businesses, this idea of not raising money, just making revenue, living off the revenue versus venture-backed venture scale companies feels like you're very good at the first bucket and a lot of people, this is their dream, "I'm just going to start something. I'll start a lifestyle business, make a few million a year, never raise money. Who needs VCs? VCs suck." Advice for deciding which route to go with an idea you have.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:26:03):
Well, I think it's just not true that a "lifestyle" or bootstrap business can't get huge. I mean, we bootstrapped the entire business and now across all of our companies we do almost $300 million in revenue. And the whole time I had been focusing on taking, starting small businesses, small ideas, simple ideas, often buying small companies and watching them grow really big. And I think that the only difference between what we do and what a venture capitalist does is the level of tolerance of burning money on fire. And I just haven't seen that If we choose the right businesses that aren't in incredibly competitive markets or where they have some sort of moat. So what I mean by that is a great brand or a network effect like a social network or something like that, I don't feel we're holding them back by not letting them light up a bunch of money on fire because these things naturally grow.

(00:27:12):
The numbers, I mean they're like balloons, they just go as long as we don't mess them up too much. So I think the decision ultimately comes down to how hairy do you want your big, hairy, audacious goal to be? And if your big, hairy, audacious goal is I'm going to start the next satellite business that creates some sort of crazy technological revolution. Yes, you're going to have to raise a venture capital unless you're already a billionaire or something like that. But if you're wanting to just tinker and solve a problem that you think is not going to be hyper-competitive, so for example, that form-filling thing or software that just does a narrow thing that doesn't require 20, 30, 40 million to be lit on fire before it can make money, then you can have a wonderful life and build a wonderful company that can scale into the hundreds of millions of dollars if you play your cards right without ever raising money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:09):
Per the story you shared with Flow where you're competing against a venture-funded company, if there is a venture-backed company in this space, is the advice you're not going to win competing with them most likely and try to do something else.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:28:22):
Well, look at Things. Do you know Things?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:25):
I have used Things

Andrew Wilkinson (00:28:26):
I do too. It's awesome. Things still exist and Things has existed for 20 years. It's run by I believe one or two or three people. It's not a big team, certainly under 10 people, it was, I believe, bootstrapped and it's just consistently delivered an exceptional product and built up a loyal following. They have their 10,000 true fans who use it, and that's enough for them, but they don't do a lot. They've been very intentional. They don't do any AI stuff, they don't have an API. They're not on Android. They're very focused and I think they have succeeded. But the question is, what would an MBA or a business professor say about their success? If the measure of success is did they maximize taking as much market share as possible and grow to be as big as possible, then the answer is no because Asana and other people have built multi-billion dollar companies.

(00:29:28):
If the goal is the founder has an incredible life, probably has three houses, flies all over the place, does whatever he wants, has recurring revenue and he gets to work with headphones on building beautiful piece of software that people love, then I think he's won. I am generally much more in the camp of the Things guy has won, not Dustin Moskovitz. Dustin Moskovitz is just playing a different game than the Things guy. And if Dustin Moskovitz was running Things, he'd be miserable and if the Things guy was running Asana, he would probably kill himself because he wants to put his headphones on and build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):
I wonder why nobody has come. It feels like just with lifestyle businesses, if it's working and you would think somebody would come in with more money and more funding and just eat their lunch, is the key that the market is too small for a VC to ever be excited and so that's why no one's coming for them?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:30:21):
I think so. I mean, I think Things probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know any of the numbers or whatever, but I would assume it makes between five and $25 million of revenue, which to a VC is not even worth considering a VC. For a VC to invest in your business, you need to have a story where it's worth 300 million to a billion dollars or more. So it's just not that exciting to them, which again, going back to fish where the fish are, you don't want to be fighting against the commercial fishermen. If you just want to have a little business where you get enough fish to feed your family and your village or whatever, find the other fishing hole. Don't go where the trawlers are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:04):
This is great advice if you're trying to start a non venture backed company is find. This metaphor just keeps working for us, which is fish where the fish are, but not where the professional fishermen are. Also, ideally not where there's just a ton of, I don't know, fishermen from all over the place. I don't know, solopreneur fishermen. Okay. Coming back to just starting a successful company, what would you say are the keys to an amazing business model, an amazing business broadly, what should you be thinking about and looking into? I know you spent a lot of time thinking about this. When you're buying companies, what are a few bullet points that you want to focus on?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:31:38):
What I do for a living is basically buy businesses. So in my early career I started one business, then I started about 10 more, and then I realized starting businesses was extremely hard and I was doing pretty well. I was making quite a bit of money and I'd sold one of my businesses and I was looking out at the next 10 years and really asking myself what do I want my career to be and am I happy doing what I'm doing? And the answer was no. I did not starting businesses and experiencing that failure rate, it was incredibly stressful. And so I picked up a book about investing and I got lucky. The first one I bought was about Warren Buffett, and for those that don't know, Warren Buffett is he's counter to every VC kind of hustle culture thing you might hear because he basically just sits quietly in a room and reads all day, despite owning 260 different businesses and being one of the 10 wealthiest people in the world, his life is incredibly calm.

(00:32:44):
He only does what he wants and he spends most of his time quietly reading and once or twice a year, he makes a big decision to buy a business. And so when I read about Warren Buffett, I just thought, wow, I'm a sucker. I'm running around like a crazy person trying to run all these businesses. Why am I not just buying businesses and letting them run? And so when I'm buying a business, what I'm really looking for is something that I can't mess up. Right now, obviously we buy a business, we try not to mess it up, and we're very intentional, actually very odd in that when Tiny buys a company, we generally just leave them alone. If they already have management in place, we say nothing changes, no one should know that we've even bought them. Obviously people know that, but really there should be no change whatsoever.

(00:33:31):
The only change that we generally make is if the founder wants to leave the business, then we'll bring in a CEO to run the company, and that's probably the most important decision that we make. So I'm looking for a business though where it is so good that it's hard to mess up, and most businesses are very easy to mess up. One person leaves and the whole business falls apart because it's held together with dental floss and duct tape. And so I'm really looking for what Warren Buffett would call a moat. So a moat is basically a brand, so that could be a brand like Coca-Cola, Tylenol, Advil, something like that. So something that gives you pricing power where you can consistently charge and you have loyal customers or where we usually find a lot of opportunity is in network effects.

(00:34:23):
So typically we're looking for a community that's gotten so big where people don't want to go elsewhere. So for example, we own Letterboxd, which is the largest social network for film lovers. And the question is, if someone else wants to compete with us, why would someone go to their social network that has a small number of users when all their friends are already on Letterboxd? And so you see that same kind of thing with Instagram or Facebook or similar. And so we're looking for businesses like that, something that has staying power that is hard to compete with and that we can hold over the very long term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):
It was interesting when Elon bought X, how that was such a test of the power of network effects. If you think about it, back then he changed the name. So the brand completely changed the team. 80% of the people left. What was left, it was the network and the network effect and the simplest way. Just for folks that aren't super familiar with network effects, the way I think about it is just network effect is where every additional user that joins the network becomes more useful for everybody.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:35:27):
There's another moat, which is high switching costs, which I don't really like because it's not really very consumer friendly, but an example might be Salesforce where no one wants to, they've spent years and they've done all the implementation and trained everyone on it, and it's kind of the standard, everybody hates it, but ripping it out and switching is such a pain in the that they just won't bother. That's another form of sometimes a great business, but again, that's more depressing. I don't love that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:56):
What's the last company you guys bought?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:35:58):
We bought Serato. Serato is the largest DJ software company in the world. So if you ever see a DJ playing and they've got a laptop in front of them, probably using Serato to DJ.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
Wow, that is super cool. What I'd like a funding to be walking into.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:36:14):
I used to DJ so I was aware of them and it was one of those moments we talked about earlier where I understood the business. They had a really interesting mode of this huge passionate user base and deep hardware integration. And I also love DJing and I was able to analyze the business and luck comes to the prepared mind and it worked out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):
This is another great callback to your excellent piece of advice of just ideally what you're working on, whether you're starting the company or buying the company, is you have a unique unfair advantage or some kind of unique background that connects to that idea. Let me ask you one more question before we shift a whole different topic, hint, hint, AI. Something that I know you talk a lot about, something you believe strongly and something you deal with a lot is when you buy companies is just as people and the challenges of management and hiring and people. So what have you learned about just how to successfully, I don't know, find amazing people, keep amazing people, help people be more successful within the companies that you operate?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:37:15):
My business partner, Chris, has a really great quote. He says, "There are no problems. There is only people problems." And so we've found that you could tell us that there's a disaster that one of our business units is about to fail or something like that. As long as I'm surrounded by really great smart people, I feel fine. But when we have a bad actor, we have a psycho or a narcissist or a really horrible, difficult person we're dealing with, all bets are off and life becomes incredibly stressful. So I'd say I spend probably 20% of my time just trying to make sure we're filtering people very carefully and ensuring we're working with people that we enjoy. And I could talk about it in the AI, I've done some really interesting stuff to help me screen and identify difficult people, but I've just found that the biggest mistake I made in my early career was I would hire people because I liked them on gut and I would think that I could change them.

(00:38:12):
So it's kind of like in romantic relationships, it never works out well. If you get married to someone and you go, "Okay, well this is going to be a great relationship as long as I can convert them to Christianity or I can change their parents or their personality," or whatever it is. And so I've just found that I've never been able to change someone. You can never mentor someone out into being a good employee. And the kind of heuristic I have is if I ever think, should I fire this person even once, I should fire them immediately. It has always been a signal, at least for me, that when someone's a superstar, I can't imagine firing them. I think it's impossible, I'd be lost without them.

(00:38:56):
But when I repeatedly start going, "Man, is this person going to work out?" Almost always within six to 12 months, it doesn't work out. And so I really try and be really direct about stuff like that and just cut when it's not working. So I'd say the lesson really is hire for what you need. Don't hire just for potential, which is counter to what a lot of people say. A lot of people say hire for potential and coach them into being whatever you need. I just haven't found that. I think you need to hire someone who already is fully formed and can do what you need. But again, everyone does it differently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):
This is big advice. Powerful advice. Is this true not just for the CEOs of the companies you run? As for folks under lower down the ladder too?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:39:39):
Well, for CEOs, one of the most interesting things we've observed is, so I'll give you an example. We had a CEO come in and we were interviewing them and in my opinion, the business needed to grow via organic marketing. In his opinion, it was enterprise sales. And so when we're interviewing him, he keeps going back to his experience building with enterprise sales. And there's this great saying, "To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail." And so for him, he's looking at this business and going enterprise sales, that's the way to grow. I hire him, but I say, "Look, if we're going to hire you, we need you to do the organic marketing." Lo and behold, of course, he goes off and he does the enterprise sales thing. And I've just found that hiring CEOs is like they're an elephant and you're the rider.

(00:40:31):
They're going to go wherever it is that they want to go. And so listening incredibly carefully to people's words and their experiences, because generally people will do the thing they tell you. So what I look for when I interview a CEO now, I want to be nodding along. I want to go, that's exactly what I would do or that's way smarter than my idea. And then I just leave them alone because I've found that anytime I try and pull them in a certain direction or coach them or whatever, it just doesn't work. And again, this could be my problem. I might be the world's worst coach and mentor, but for me, that's been what's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):
I imagine there's also an element of they won't love the job if they want to be doing say enterprise sales, and then they're creating viral TikTok videos all day and tweeting. They're like, "What the hell?"

Andrew Wilkinson (00:41:15):
Well, I've also found people will shoot themselves in the foot. If I tell them an idea in a board meeting and I say, "I really need you to try this," it never works because usually they sandbag it, right? They don't really put their heart into it or they're just placating me and they don't want it to work. They want their idea to work. And so I've learned not to do that.

Let's talk about AI. It's so funny to watch you on Twitter. Clearly you've become AI obsessed, AIphile. I don't know what the term is, and I love that you're not just the kind of person that just talks about it and tweets pontifications, you're clearly using it in every facet of your job and looking for more ways to use AI. So I have a lot of questions here because I think this is where more and more founders are going to be where you are today. First of all, just what's in your AI stack these days? What are the tools you find yourself coming back to most or finding most useful?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:43:10):
So the primary tool I use is a tool called Lindy, Lindy.ai. And what it basically lets you do is build workflows and agents. So it's very simple. You might say, "When I get an email in the Gmail API, I want to add an AI agent that reads the email and labels it based on that." Or you can build a crazy Rube Goldberg machine that sends different emails all sorts of different places. So for example, when I get an email and it's related to my kid's school, one of the big problems I have is that my kid's school sends so many emails, the field trip is on Thursday and you need to bring the following things. And meanwhile, there's parent teacher interviews and all these things get added to my calendar. The AI agent automatically takes that, puts it onto my calendar, makes sure there's notes for all the things I need to prepare and stuff. So I have just basically tried to take every single thing a human could do in my inbox and automate it with Lindy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):
And you're sitting there in Lindy doing this yourself or do you have people that you've trained to help build these sorts of things for you?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:16):
No, I do it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):
Okay. How many agents, if that's the term you want to use, do you have running for you roughly?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:22):
Oh man, I think I probably have not a crazy amount within... Let's see. Well, each workflow probably has four or five agents. So for example, my inbox has four or five agents, and then I have a whole bunch of other, I've got a calendar agent, I've got a meeting agent, I've got an email agent, I've got a scheduler, I've got a CRM, and basically they're all different workflows. So the whole bunch of agents within.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Okay, and you're not an investor in Lindy, right? You're just a fan, super user.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:53):
No, no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):
Fun fact. I actually am. So this is great.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:44:56):
Oh, no way. That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:57):
Tiny angel investor. So just want to put that out there, which I love that this came up organically. What are a couple other really interesting use cases, workflows you've built that people might be inspired by it?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:45:08):
Let me go through the email one a little more. So basically emails come in and the first agent says, does Andrew even need to see this? Let's say you're in a thread and you've already chimed in and everyone's just saying, cool, that works. I don't need to see that. So just archives that never. So that immediately reduces my email by about 20%. Then it decides is this something that is time sensitive? Is this something that needs to be dealt with in the next 24 hours? And if so, it labels it in a special 24-hour label. So when I go in my email, one of the biggest stresses I find is I go, "Shit, there's 200 emails in here, and if I don't go through all of them, I don't know if there's an emergency burning somewhere." So now I do. Then it takes any email or every single email and it decides, is this a simple decision?

(00:46:00):
So for example, let's say you email me and you say, "Hey, do you want to get lunch?" So it emails me privately and it says, "Hey, Lenny wants to get lunch. Do you want to say yes? Do you want to say yes, but in a few months? Do you want to say no? How do you want to say no?" And it gives me multiple choice. I just can say four, number four, and then it'll email you as me and it'll write out a nice thoughtful email or whatever. So stuff like that is so freaking cool and helpful. And I'd say that it's replaced stuff that my full-time, I used to have a full-time assistant just working on email that's all completely automated and there's all sorts of other cool stuff I'm doing there. Other agents, I'm working on one right now to manage my calendar, which is really complex. I do a lot of scheduling and a lot of rules. I have another really simple one. It adds emojis to every single calendar event. So when I look at my calendar, I've got beautiful little emojis for every single calendar event. Very silly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:00):
What are the emojis? Do they represent something?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:03):
Yeah, so if I write weightlifting, it'll just do a guy weightlifting or whatever. I've got one that, this one's cool. Basically what it does, every time I email someone, it looks them up online, it figures out what city they live in. It checks my CRM and air table. It says, "Okay, I don't know where do you live."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:21):
In Marin, in the Bay Area.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:22):
Okay. So it'd say, "Okay, you email Lenny, he lives in Marin." It puts in the database you live in Marin. And then next time I travel to the Bay Area, the agent will see two weeks before and it'll say, "I saw you're going to San Francisco. Here's all the people in San Francisco you should try and have coffee with." Right? So just all these things that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):
I would pay for that.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:47:43):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. All these things that I've dreamed of having my assistant do that my assistant could just never consistently do because she gets distracted, we're doing an event, there's something going on. It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:02):
Okay, I want to follow that thread, but first of all, what other tools do you have? Lindy's one, what else do you find really useful?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:48:08):
So the other one is Replit. So Replit is basically a vibe coding platform. You can literally go into it and say, "I want to make a website for my sound software business. Here's a big document with a bunch of details," and it'll go and design a pretty impressive website. But then you can also build web apps now. So you can literally be like, "Yeah, build a Python web app that does XYZ," and the design is getting so good because it uses Claude 4. You can start saying, "Do it in the style of Stripe. Think this through, rewrite all the copy and the tone of David Ogilvy or Malcolm Gladwell," or whoever you like, and it does a really incredible job. So what I'm finding is that things that previously would've frustrated me because I would've had to rely on a team of five, I can just do entirely on my own when it comes to web projects and stuff like that. So I'm having a blast with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):
That's cool. So your team Replit versus Lovable, Bolt, v0, is that roughly right?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:49:12):
I mean, they're all great. I, just am the most familiar with Replit, and it seems like it has the most functionality. It has a lot of beef to it, whereas Lovable and Bolt seem a little more basic. You might have to deal with deployment and stuff in a fiddlier way with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):
Awesome. Okay. Anything else?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:49:32):
Another one I love, so Limitless. I don't know if you've seen this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):
I've got one of those.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:49:37):
It's really cool. So clips to your shirt. I actually just put it on my pocket so no one actually notices that I've got it on usually, and I just have it on all day. And what it does is it just records everything I do. And then I can say, the other day I had a coffee with someone and I'm the kind of person where I go a mile a minute and I say, "Oh, I'll send you that and I'll do this," or whatever. And so at the end of the day, I can just say, "Hey, what did I promise to people today?" Or even better, everyone loves this use case, I have a fight with my girlfriend. And she says, "You didn't say that." And I'm able to say, "Well, actually you did." And you can query it as an LLM.

(00:50:16):
So you can say you're a couples counselor. Look at this fight. What did each person need? How did it start? What are the key lines? Where did it change? How could you do this better? And so honestly, from a relationship standpoint is probably where it's been the most useful. What's cool too is that has an API. And so eventually, I haven't gotten there yet, but eventually you'll be able to just have it record your entire day and then automatically go into your Todoist or whatever it is, and add to-do's or send emails or whatever you need it to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:48):
Wow, this is so fun. Or just per your point with the relationship, ask it, "What could I have done better today? Where did the day go downhill?"

Andrew Wilkinson (00:50:57):
Yeah, I saw a guy on Twitter. He said, "Every day I ask it, 'How could I have been a better dad?'" And it'll be like, "Oh, your daughter tried to get your attention about this. You should have paid attention," or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):
And that was with the Limitless data. Oh, man, I love that. With the relationship, you didn't go where I thought you were going to go, where it's like, "Oh, but who actually said it? What did you actually say?" I love that It became much more wholesome of just like how could we have communicated better holistically? Okay. My wife actually is like, "Don't wear this around."

Andrew Wilkinson (00:51:25):
You just got to wear it really covertly. Honestly, I know it sounds kind of cheesy because you think like, "Oh, it'll tell her," right? But in reality, usually you're both guilty in the fight. And my girlfriend has actually appreciated it because there's been half the time it'll be like, "Oh yeah, Zoe said this and it triggered this," but a lot of the time it's me too. And I think I'm totally right. So I find it actually really helpful. Other tools, I mean otherwise, it's the basic stack of Claude and ChatGPT and Gemini. And Gemini I use mostly for things that are really large. So for example, all my medical records, I have trained on Gemini 2.5 just because the other ones can't really go through it all. Claude, I use for writing very extensively. I find it's the best for that.

(00:52:14):
And then ChatGPT for everything else. In terms of cool things I do, recently, I went through my entire medicine cabinet and I just took big photos that showed all the different medicines and stuff. And now I can say something like, "Hey, I'm really tired and stressed out today. What supplement should I take and what dose?" Or I'll say, "Remember all the medications I'm taking, whenever I ask you a health question, always remind me in the context of I might be taking that medication." So a few times it's said, "Hey, you shouldn't take this other medication because your genetics say you're not compatible with it and you're already taking this other one." So stuff like that's been really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:57):
For that use case, do you come back to a specific conversation where you've given it that context, use a project or something-

Andrew Wilkinson (00:53:02):
No, I say remember. I just say remember these supplements, this is what I have in my medicine cabinet or this is what I take every day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:10):
I see. So just tap into the memory of ChatGPT.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:53:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:13):
This is awesome. This makes me remember that. And this connects to other points you've been making, I've started to use ChatGPT deep research to prep for these conversations. I used to have a researcher who did this for 400 bucks. They did research on every guest that I had, four to 500 bucks, and gave me a whole doc, "Here's everything about them. Here's their background, here's questions you might want to ask." Deep research is better. Just as of recently, especially with o3-pro.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:53:39):
We were talking earlier about agents. I forgot one of my favorite agents. So it looks on my calendar 30 minutes before I meet anyone. It goes on to Perplexity and it does a deep dive on the person and it sends me, it goes into my email and it gets the context of the meeting. So often I book meetings three months out. So I usually look at my calendar and I go, "Who is this person? I don't even remember booking this meeting." It'll text me before and it'll say, "Here's who you are, here's your background, here's the email context of why we're meeting." And it basically does all the research for me. So I do the same thing. I also use deep research and say, "If I'm meeting them, you know everything about me. What are our commonalities and what are all the fun things we should talk about?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:22):
Oh my God, I just want to plug and play all these agents you've built to use them myself. Interestingly, I tried to create an agent to do this research kickoff for me, but I don't think you can automate ChatGPT deep research. Okay.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:54:35):
Only Perplexity. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:37):
Okay. Perplexity is great too, but it's different. Okay. So let me follow this thread I was going down, which is around job displacement. I know you think a lot about this. So with me, this researcher as a contractor I was working with for a few months, I no longer need them. Your assistant, you no longer need. Thoughts on just the impact we're going to see on jobs as a result of AI.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:54:58):
There's this great William Gibson quote, "The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed." And I think that we are in the Palm Treo phase. Do you remember the Palm Treo?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):
No.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:55:10):
So when I was, let's see, in 2007 I think, was that when the iPhone came out? 2007?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:17):
I know [inaudible 00:55:19].

Andrew Wilkinson (00:55:18):
Something like that. In 2007, there was this device called the Palm Treo and it was like a little PDA with a stylus and it had a little modem attachment. And so what you could do is you could get your email anywhere and that was this shocking thing. It had a black and white or barely color screen and you could go in and email people. And I remember walking through the mall buying shoes while answering business emails and going, "This is the ultimate freedom. This is incredible." But the problem with that device was it sucked. You had to use a stylus, it's not a good user experience. And then the iPhone comes out and you're like, "Okay, this is what I was waiting for. This is the real thing." But I got a little preview with the Palm Treo and so right now people like me who have the time and skillset to nerd out and build the agents can do this. It's just not accessible to everybody.

(00:56:14):
And I think that if it was accessible to everybody in terms of if you could just open ChatGPT and say, "Hey, ChatGPT, I run a business, can you help me?" And it started asking you questions and it said, "Oh well you do sales. Do you want me to set up a sales agent? Okay, great, plug in your HubSpot API, now tell me a few things and then give me access to all your data." And then before you know it, it's just a digital employee that's on the other end of the phone on ChatGPT just like in the movie, Her, that you can talk to and it can go do stuff. I think that is kind of the iPhone moment that we're going to have in some time in the next five years. And so I think that if AI doesn't progress, we will see some serious job displacement, like what you already mentioned, the translators, the researchers, the admin, some assistant jobs, depending on the kind of work they do, those jobs will definitely be massively affected.

(00:57:13):
But I think pretty quick, all knowledge work jobs could be affected if the models scale in the way that they say they're going to. I mean if you trust Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, I mean Dario Amodei said by, "2027, our models will be smarter than all PhDs." So in any subject. That is a staggering statement. And he's been a very conservative kind of almost fearful voice in the AI world. Very cautious to say things like that. And so when he said that, I perked up and started listening carefully. I don't know that that's how it's going to play out. He might be trying to fundraise, we have to take it with a grain of salt. But if that's true, then I think so many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):
Okay, there's a lot here. I actually had Mike on the podcast, their CPL, Mike Krieger, and he pointed out that Dario, every prediction he's had so far has been right over the past few years. And so there's a reason to listen to his insights. Okay. Andrew, I know you're not going to have all the answers for people. But let me ask you kind of a two-part question for new grads and for people currently in the workforce say like, I don't know, senior product manager advice on what they should do, where should they focus? What skills will matter most? What jobs do you think will last? What advice can you give us?

Andrew Wilkinson (00:58:43):
Everybody 10 years ago, do you remember there was this whole movement that we should teach kids how to code? Remember that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):
Mh-hmm.

Andrew Wilkinson (00:58:51):
Now teaching kids how to code is teaching kids Basic and we have a GUI, right? You don't need to learn punch cards and basic programming or MS-DOS because we all have keyboards and mice. We don't have to do that. And I feel like coding has really gone away because of that. And I think now people are saying people need to learn how to prompt, which I think is very true for the tool set right now. But I don't know how relevant that is in the future because I think we're still, again, in the Palm Treo phase, I think that the AIs will be very good at eliciting what the actual problem you're trying to solve is and reinterpreting it in a way that it can optimize the query to get the right answer and solve the problem.

(00:59:38):
And so I think the fundamental question is do all jobs just become a single prompt? For example, does a CEO just grow the business while making the customers happy and turning a profit or something like that? And it is able to actually be an omniscient presence that can run a whole company. Now that's a big I'm someone building AI agents. I can barely get it to reliably do calendar entries and that kind of stuff. So I don't think that's totally imminent, but I can certainly see a world where that's coming. And so the question is, what is one to do when that reality is barreling down at you? For people who have resources, I think there's a lot of things they can do in terms of investment, they can invest in the companies that'll benefit from this, companies that have a lot of compute or energy or that sort of thing.

(01:00:29):
So that's one thing, but that's not really the question. The question is what do you do if you're a smart 18-year-old or 19-year-old or whatever? In my opinion, I think the best thing to do right now is to get incredibly good with these tools and utilize them to build enough wealth that you can put the money into diversifying into compute and energy. And I do think that while everybody thinks that all jobs will go away in five years and robots will be everywhere, people generally overestimate things in the short term and underestimate them in the long term. So I think there's going to be this long window where robotics is not anywhere near good enough to even do raking leaves and stuff. And I think there's going to be a ton of opportunity for people to just spin up new businesses that never existed before.

(01:01:20):
I was talking to some friends and we were like, "What do you do in a world of abundance where everything is really cheap and companies operate almost autonomously?" I think there's a lot of weird skillsets that we can't imagine right now. For example, just being funny, right? Being funny to hang out with them. Think about OnlyFans, right? Right now, there's this whole idea of OnlyFans where people are paying for comfort and connection, but in a romantic sense. Imagine people did that day to day, they just love hanging out with funny people. So you have a funny guy who you chat with or comes over to your house or whatever it is, I'm making stuff up. Maybe it's a guy who comes to play pickleball with you or something, I don't know. But I can imagine that in this weird world, there's all these weird new jobs.

(01:02:06):
So I think my take is things will either be totally fine or they will be terrible and we'll all be dead. And I can't predict which those is there. I don't think it's worth thinking about all of us being dead. And so I think it's really just lean into what are the tools, how do you stay cutting edge? How do you build businesses and wealth in this new world? But I am certainly feeling a little bit like all of our brains could be defunct in the next 10 years. And that's kind of a scary thought.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
I'm picturing this dystopian world where humans are just going around making jokes.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:02:44):
Where does status come from in a world of abundance? Where does status come from? Maybe it is just like being the best at hiking or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:52):
Well, let me ask you this because this is where it gets even more real is just with your kids. What are you encouraging them to learn? What are you encouraging them to get good at? Because this is the real problem a lot of people are having right now is what will matter in the future. Obviously we don't know, but what are you encouraging them to focus on?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:03:09):
Well, I don't know. I mean there's so little, they're five and eight. And so really what I'm focused on is making sure they're socialized and they're polite, very basic. So are they comfortable talking to adults? I often send my son, whenever he wants something at a cafe, I always make him go up, ask nicely, pay himself, all that kind of stuff. But at this point I feel like for the first 10 years of life, you're just trying to make sure that they're not traumatized or rude. And I think it's going to be really interesting when they're 10 plus where they're really aware of this stuff and can start building with these tools. And to be honest, I just don't know. I think I just want them to lean into whatever they're passionate about and go from there. But I have no idea. And to be honest, it's not something I'm worrying about because it's too hard to worry about. I don't know, it's too multivariate. There's too many ways it can go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:03):
I feel like a core part of your message is just get good with these tools. There's this classic quote, "AI won't replace you, it'll be somebody very good using AI is going to replace you," at least for a while. And so it feels like a big part of this is just use these things. Before we started recording, we were having a mic issue and I love you just went straight to ChatGPT, "ChatGPT, how do I connect this mic to reverse side and make it work?" And I feel like that's just a habit to build is just like go to ChatGPT whenever you have a problem like that. I've been doing that a lot. I was connecting a subwoofer from what wire do I need to buy to connect the subwoofer to the receiver?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:04:37):
Well, the best part about ChatGPT is I used to just get stuck and I have ADHD. So when I got stuck, let's say, what's an example? I was redoing my home IT security. And what will happen is I'll be in the terminal and I'll enter something and then something goes wrong and it just keeps erroring. And then I'm like, "Well, I'm out." I have ADHD, I can't tolerate this. I just lose the thread completely. And ChatGPT allows me to stay on track and go so much further and faster than I ever could before. I love not being artificially stopped in your tracks and being able to continue the flow state as a result.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
And also I noticed you were using voice mode, which is what I've been using more and more. And I feel like that's something a lot of people sleep on is just the voice mode where you could talk to it and not have to sit there and type your questions. Okay, so let me go in a different direction. You've been spending a lot of time, you wrote a whole book about this, of just your journey from, you call it Barista to Billionaire where you started serving coffee, then you ended up being very successful, then realize that didn't make you happy. You're quite unhappy with lots and lots of money. I think a lot of people hear these stories, they see this stuff, they're like, "Yeah, okay, I sort of get it." But they still do the same sorts of things. They still assume they will be happy once they reach that next goal, that next title, make certain dollar amount. What can you share? What have you learned about just what it actually takes to be happy that you think people are still not really recognizing and still kind of are confused about?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:06:10):
Do you remember when you're in your early 20s? I remember when I was in my early 20s, I'd always be like, "I need to move away to Europe. I need to go discover myself." And I'd be really anxious and stressed out and in an existential crisis and then I'd fly to Europe to go backpacking or something and I'd still feel anxious and have my existential crisis. It's just now I'm in Europe. And I think the reality is that whatever's in your brain, whatever that anxiety loop is, doesn't go away just because you have a bigger house or more money in the bank account or you're in Bali or wherever it is, that's a chemical reaction happening inside you that relates to your past and your DNA and all that stuff that creates that soup. And for me, I've always been a very anxious person. I've always worried about tomorrow, I rarely enjoy today, I'm always worrying about what could go wrong in health or my businesses or with my family or whatever it is.

(01:07:12):
And so when I started my business, all I thought was I just don't want to work for someone else. If I can just wake up in the morning, do my own thing, make 60K a year, then I'll be happy. So I got that and then it was once I make a million dollars a year and I can buy a house, well, I got that and so on and so on and so on all the way up to at one point being worth over a billion dollars, by the way, should redo the title of the book from Barista to Billionaire, now it's former billionaire because our stock went down, but it didn't change anything. I'm still just as anxious as ever. I remember a month ago, I had this day where I was sitting in the sauna and I was stressing about a bunch of business problems and money things and I stopped myself and I was like, "Wait a minute."

(01:08:04):
10 years ago I had all the same thoughts and I was stressed out about similar kinds of problems and our revenue was $20 million bucks or $15 million bucks. Now we're at almost 300 million and I'm still stressed about the same things. And the saddest part was as I met more and more wealthier people all the way up to multibillionaires, I realized they were all still comparing themselves to their peers, competing over who has what and tracking stuff and still unhappy that anxiety loop or depression was still in their brain. I remember I had this moment where I met this guy who is a single-digit multibillionaire, and he goes, "Oh, Jeff Bezos, he's just so fucking rich." And I was like, "Wait, what do you mean you're worth $5 billion? What can he do that you can't?" And he goes, "He can buy a super yacht." And it's like, "What?"

(01:09:09):
You can look at that guy and you can say, "Oh, that's a wacko and all the other stuff." But the reality is that we're all just comparing ourselves to our peers, whatever our peers have that we don't feel hard done by. And I remember just thinking like, "Oh my God, how do I avoid becoming this?" And that's the scary reality is no matter how lucky you are, I mean we're also fortunate. For me, I live in Canada. I have every opportunity that I ever could have hoped for. And there's people all over the world who have nowhere near what I had growing up. And yet I felt hard done by because in my neighborhood I was the poor kid. I wasn't poor globally. I wasn't even poor based on Canada. But all my friends had big screen TVs and would go to Hawaii and I never got to do any of that stuff. My parents were stressed about money. So I feel hard done by.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:05):
There's a phrase of friend's financial advisor once shared, "The Joneses are doing really well," and that's hard to get over. So what changes did you make to just be happier? It's hard to give up money. It's hard to give up more money you could make. It's hard to give up things that money buys, I guess just so what did you change?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:10:28):
Well, there's a few things. I mean, one was reframing money to some degree to have it be something that wasn't just about feathering my own nest and making it better. So for example, I was talking to a friend who's very wealthy and I was saying all the feelings I described of have all this and yet I don't feel better. And he said, "Well, what are you working for?" And I said, "Well, I guess I'm just working for the numbers to get bigger and have more employees and that's nice. Our businesses do good things in the world and help more people and stuff, but ultimately it's just to pile up cash." And he said, "I've reframed it so that all my money, 90% of my money plus, goes into my philanthropic foundation and then it gets given away to great causes. So when I think about working really hard or losing a deal or an investment going well, the win isn't for me. The win is about doing something good."

(01:11:26):
So I did that and that definitely helped. I also stopped spending as much money. I found that the more stuff I had, the more houses I had, the more people that directly worked for me to manage all that stuff, the less happy, I was owned by my stuff. And then I work really hard not to have people... I try not to beat people over the head with it. I drive a normal car. I don't bring people to my house until I know them really, really well. I meet them on neutral ground, I meet them in a cafe. I dress like a schmo. I just try not to be a weird out of touch rich person. But the biggest thing, which is a weird answer, is actually medicating myself. So basically all my life I've been really anxious.

(01:12:18):
And in 2020, I remember I was watching a movie with my ex-wife and I was looping on, "I need to respond to this email. If I don't respond to that email, this person's going to be mad." And then I realized that I was watching a movie for the last 20 minutes and I didn't know anything about what was happening in the movie. And then I was going, "Oh my God, my wife is going to be mad at me. We're going to get in a fight," and I'm projecting all this negative stuff. And in that moment I was like, "Okay, maybe I do need to try an SSRI or something. This is not sustainable." And so I went to my doctor and I got prescribed with one, and I remember I was so scared of it that I cut it into 10 pieces. I said, "I'm just going to take a tiny little piece."

(01:13:01):
And it took me six months after that to try any. But I started taking these pieces every day and I just noticed that within about three or four days, it was like someone had turned down the volume on the nasty voice inside of me doing all that. And for the first time in my life I felt relief. No amount of money or success or attention or anything else had done what this little tiny yellow pill could do for my mental state. And so now I've been on an SSRI for four and a half years or something like that. And then I also started medicating my ADHD. And I would say that my brain went from Times Square to a quiet library. And I think a lot of people are scared of that, but ultimately most people are acting out something that's going on inside of them. There's a trauma or something medically going on and that's creating this anxiety, this depression, this feeling and addressing that is so much more important than trying to get praise from the external world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):
Wow, it's really powerful. I really am really thankful you're sharing this. The advice most people hear, the general, I don't know, culture is just like, "No, don't take meds. Don't medicate yourself, I don't know, there's all these downsides, all this risk. The pharma industry is trying to make money." I love this other perspective of it. It's actually really effective and actually makes a big difference in your life and it may be the only solution.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:14:29):
Well, it's funny because if you have a headache, I don't think many people say, "Oh, don't take Tylenol, you're benefiting Johnson & Johnson, big pharma." They go, "Yeah, you take a Tylenol when you have a headache." Or a lot of people have seasonal allergies and they take antihistamines and they forget that histamine is not just in your nose, histamines in your brain and everywhere in your body. And so when you take an antihistamine or even a Tylenol, you're changing your brain, you're changing the way you think, you're changing everything. And yet for some reason, people are so scared, myself included, of taking an SSRI or similar medication to treat something that is ruining their life. Anxiety was ruining my life. Every minute of every day I was convinced that something terrible was about to happen. And even now medicated, I still have that voice. It's not like that frankly beneficial voice that helps you grow your business or whatever becomes unproductive at a certain point. And I think that it is wonderful to be able to actually just get a little bit of solace from it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Well, for folks that, I mentioned many folks listening, are like, "Oh man, I should really explore this," what's the best way to explore is to talk to your primary care physician?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:15:47):
Yeah. I think talking to your doctor, and one note I think a lot of people miss is when I was so scared of side effects because you hear about all these horrific side effects of people lose their libido and feel terrible and stuff. And so I looked into it and a lot of the side effects are due to the way that people metabolize different drugs. And so you can actually do your 23andMe or similar DNA test and you can find out how you metabolize different SSRIs. And then I chose one that I could metabolize well. And so I've had no side effects or problems. And I know every time I mention this, I get a lot of people that say exactly what you say, big pharma and all this other stuff. But I just ask everyone listening, if you take a Tylenol or you take an antihistamine or other medications, I don't know why something that can be so profoundly helpful is something that people need to be afraid of.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):
Amazing. Andrew, we've covered so much ground. I love the spectrum of topics we've gone after. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything you wanted to double down on? Any last nugget you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:16:56):
One thing that was shocking for me was I was doing... My doctor asked me to get a cognitive test, not because I had any problem, but he said, "Look, it's really important to get a baseline in your 30s because then as you age, we can make sure that you're not getting Alzheimer's or dementia or whatever." So I go and I do this test with a neurologist and she asked me a bunch of questions. It's, "Remember these 10 digits and say them backwards and all this stuff." And finally when I get my test results back, she said, "Look, your crystallized intelligence, your ability to remember stuff, long range is totally fine. You're above average. Your short-term memory, your working memory is 10th percentile, very, very bad. And you probably should get checked for ADHD."

(01:17:47):
And I was like, "Nope. There's no way. I don't have ADHD. I'm organized. I've got to-do lists. I built a business. I wasn't the hyper kid in school or anything like that." And she said, "Well, look, just humor me. Just go get tested." And so I went through this crazy process. You can go online and just quickly get tested or whatever. But I went through this really, really five-day process to get tested. And it turned out that I do have it. And it's really interesting because if you take the normal population of about 5% of people have ADHD, but about 30% of entrepreneurs have ADHD. And many entrepreneurs I talk to, they love new things. They love jumping around between a million different topics. They're an inch deep and a mile wide like I described. And they describe themselves as unemployable. And frankly, I remember I was so skeptical of ADHD that when my girlfriend told me, a friend of hers got diagnosed with it, I sarcastically said, "Oh good, she better take some meth," talking about stimulant drugs.

(01:18:54):
Previously I was very, very skeptical of ADHD, but it is a real brain disorder if you actually dig into it. It's a very real thing, very objective that people have poor executive function. And for me, it's given me a lot more empathy for myself and my behaviors because at work, if you have ADHD, you can delegate to other people and build systems to get around your disability. But at home, that's where it really plays out. And so for me, it's like my girlfriend asked me to take the garbage out, and I say, "Of course." And then I forget three times in a row. And she views that as you are being very hurtful and you're not caring for me. And it causes all sorts of different problems at home.

(01:19:37):
And so for me, not only did it make my work life better because I was more focused, but it actually really helped me in my personal life and it made me feel not broken. I always felt a bit broken. I couldn't put my finger on why, but I just went, "I'm not good at doing all the things everyone else seems to be able to do no problem." And so I think especially because you have an entrepreneur audience, I think a lot of entrepreneurs should consider getting checked for ADHD. Just go and ChatGPT say, "Ask me a of questions and tell me if you think I might have it." But I was very surprised, and that's been really impactful for me too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:13):
Man, this garbage story is very descriptive of my life, and so I'm going to do this. There's this implication that it's good to know this, right? It feels scary to feel like, "Oh, shit I might get diagnosed with ADHD." Your advice I imagine is it's better to know because you could do stuff about it.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:20:33):
Totally. I think it's like any medical thing, right? It's like there's an Alzheimer's gene, right? And if you know you have it, there's a lot you can do to slow the disease or prevent maybe getting it or whatever. It's always better to know. Even if you don't medicate, I think there's a lot of lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, and just things you can do to make your life easier, even if it's just explaining to your partner, "Hey, I need things to be explained to me this way so that I can be effective in loving you."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:05):
Beautiful. Okay. Well, Andrew, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:21:11):
Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:12):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:21:17):
If I could only recommend two, I would recommend The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene. It's basically like a compendium of every single type of personality disorder or psychological effect. How do people work their minds to make bad decisions? What is a narcissist? What is a psychopath? All that kind of stuff. And Robert Greene does such a great job of telling all that in a really engaging way by using storytelling. So every single chapter has a story about someone with that personality disorder. So I love that book.

(01:21:48):
The other one that I love is a book by Felix Dennis called How to Get Rich. It's hilarious because the whole book starts out saying, "I got rich and I regret it, and I wish that I'd become a poet." And instead he went off and he built this huge publishing empire, became a poet in his sixties, and then he died of throat cancer. So it's his story, he basically says, "I'll tell you how to build the business even though you probably shouldn't." And I read that when I was in my 20s, and I found it so exciting and inspiring, and then I recently reread it and I was like, "Oh my God, why didn't I listen to this guy?" Everything he said came true.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:23):
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:22:27):
I love Challengers. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's amazingly acted, amazing cinematography. It's like this amazing romantic triad tennis movie. Really, really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love? You already mentioned Limitless. Is there anything else?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:22:45):
I'm one of those people who really believes in the idea of a robot vacuum. I've probably spent $10,000 on different robot vacuums over the years, probably five or six of them. And I finally got one that actually works. It's called the Matic Vacuum, M-A-T-I-C. And basically, I think it's like former Google Engineers basically built like a mini Waymo car. So it has machine vision and it will avoid absolutely everything and never get tangled, and it can mop your floors and vacuum. I've been super impressed with it so far.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):
I've got one of these myself. Completely agree. My wife loves it, which I did not expect. She's like, "Turn that Matic on." It's very delightful. It has his little personality and it just does a really good job. And I'm not an investor, and that's awesome. I'm a huge fan. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:23:38):
Yeah. My favorite is a quote by Jerzy Gregorek. It's, "Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life." And I often find that anytime that I'm making the easy choice, my life gets hard. And when I make the hard choice to shut down the business, fire the person, say bye to a project that I was excited about, it's almost always the right choice and it makes my life a lot easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:07):
Final question. Okay, so let me know if this is true. I found that when you were a teenager, when you're running Macteens, you interviewed Steve Jobs at a conference. Is that true?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:24:18):
So when I was a teenager, I had a tech news website and I emailed the Apple PR people and I said, "Hey, could I interview Steve Jobs?" And they kind of laughed at me. They're like, "Yeah, there's no way. You're not going to interview Steve Jobs, but hey, why don't you go to this tour of the Apple Store?" So this is no other Apple Store has existed. This is in New York at Macworld back in 2004, no, 2003, something like that. And so I was really excited about that. So I show up to go do this tour and there's 30 other journalists there, and I'm first in line, and this big black SUV pulls up and this man gets out and the man is wearing gray New Balance, little circular John Lennon glasses, the mock turtleneck. And my brain finally puts it together and I realize it's Steve Jobs.

(01:25:11):
And he walks directly up to me because I'm first in line and he shakes my hand and he says, "Hi, I'm Steve." And I'm like a quivering mess. I'm 17 years old. He is my hero. He's my Jesus. And so I was just so high on adrenaline that I just started asking him questions. As soon as we walked in, I basically just stayed at his side, and I just picked his brain about all sorts of different stuff. So it's not like I got to ask him questions about life. I was asking him about the new 17-inch iMac or whatever. But it was a pretty cool experience to get to meet him.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):
That is awesome. There's such a funny thread recently with guests. Everyone, there's like a Steve Jobs connection for the past couple months of guests. That's an awesome story. It just shows that it wasn't luck. You made this happen. You got there first in line.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:25:59):
The lesson for me was ask big and maybe you'll get something great. Ask for amazing, you'll get something great, which I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):
Yes, door in the face technique, I think people call it.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:26:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:12):
Andrew, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out? I know you're buying companies, investing in companies. Just talk about what you're looking for there in case people are like, "Oh, this is me." And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:26:26):
Yeah, my business is Tiny, T-I-N-Y.com, and we buy businesses. Basically, when we sold the business, we hated it. We went through this process where we talked to all these douchebags that ran private equity firms that would show up in our office in suits and use a bunch of words we didn't understand. And we ended up going, "Man, why can't we just sell to somebody who's like us?" And so we basically started Tiny to become the buyer we wish we could have sold to. And we're looking for businesses that have some of the qualities I mentioned before. So really high quality businesses that do something positive in the world and have happy customers, happy employees, and some kind of competitive advantage that will make them continue into the future. So we own AeroPress, Letterboxd, Dribble, which is a design social network, whole bunch of businesses like that. So if somebody is thinking about selling their business, definitely get in touch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):
Amazing. Okay. And then how can listeners be useful to you if it's not just that?

Andrew Wilkinson (01:27:33):
I just would say if there's anyone really interesting coming to Victoria, Canada, which is where I live, send me an email and would love to have coffee with you. The reason I love going on podcasts is because I get to meet so many interesting people, both randomly. If I'm in a cafe and someone sees me and says hi, I often make a lot of friends that way, or if someone comes to my hometown. So yeah, just get in touch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:56):
Amazing. Andrew, thank you so much for being here.

Andrew Wilkinson (01:27:59):
Yeah, thanks, dude. That was fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:00):

# The power of strategic narrative | Andy Raskin

## Transcript

Andy Raskin (00:00:00):
The way I learned how to pitch in business school, and I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatments. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. Every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, and I call this shift the shift from the old game to a new game. The archetypal example of this, I think in the business world, is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over and there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, new rules. That's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:00:54):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Andy Raskin. Andy helps CEOs and company leaders align their teams around something he calls a strategic narrative, which as you'll learn all about in this episode, is essentially a simple story that helps people understand why they need your product. And with that helps you align your sales, marketing, and product teams along with your fundraising and even your hiring efforts.

Lenny (00:01:25):
Andy has worked closely with some of the most successful founders and companies out there, including companies like Gong, Dropbox, Uber, Salesforce, Square, IBM, and many others. In our conversation, Andy explains why most people are pitching their product completely wrong, why focusing on the problem you're solving for people is no longer an effective pitch and how the strategic narrative helps you frame your solution in a much more effective way. Andy also shares a ton of examples of the framework in action, why focusing on categories and category creation is so limiting, signs your narrative needs to work and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Andy Raskin after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:07):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing a roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

Lenny (00:02:45):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

Lenny (00:04:16):
Andy, welcome to the podcast.

Andy Raskin (00:04:18):
Oh, thanks Lenny. So great to talk with you.

Lenny (00:04:21):
You are quite known as someone that helps CEOs optimize their pitch, their story, their strategy, which we're going to get deep into. But before we do that, can you just give us a little glimpse into how you found your way into this line of work?

Andy Raskin (00:04:35):
I started as a coder. I was a computer science major, undergrad, a friend and I had an idea for an app. So this was like during the dot com years. So Windows app, and we coded a little prototype and we started, we put it out there, we started getting some users and we thought, "Oh, okay, maybe we can get some investments." So of the two of us, I spoke English fluently. So we decided, okay, I'll write the investor pitch. So I wrote the pitch, we sent it out and the reaction was really bad. One VC wrote back and said, "Listen, I rate every plan I get on a scale of 1 to 10, and yours is a 1," and the next to the one he wrote in parentheses, "Worst," in case we thought maybe that was the top of his rating scale.

Lenny (00:05:20):
Brutal.

Andy Raskin (00:05:22):
Yeah, brutal. But then lower down, so this was back when they would like you'd print, send the hard copy of the plan and they might mail it back with comments written in. And he had written in, "Not a compelling story." A few weeks later, I'm walking by this Barnes & Noble and there's a sign in the window that says, "For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story," okay, that's me. And there's an arrow that points to these books and they turned out to be screenwriting books. I didn't know anything about this, so I started reading these books and it strikes me a movie is a pitch. What is Star Wars a pitch for? It's a pitch for be good, care about people, trust The Force in their terms. But I don't have couple hours. I'm pitching a business. It's very different. I'm not writing a three X screenplay.

Andy Raskin (00:06:11):
So what applies, what doesn't apply? I mean these are questions I think I'm still asking, but I did my best to take some of the learnings of how the movie was structured. It was very different from how my pitch was structured and kind of restructure it. And we did that and we sent the pitch out and we start getting more interest. It was really clear. And then we had a term sheet I think a few months later and I'm like, "What is this story thing?" That we didn't change the product, it was basically the same business just sort of how we talked about it. That was really interesting to me.

Andy Raskin (00:06:49):
I mean, over the next 10, 15 years, I thought about, "Hey, maybe I could do consulting with this." CEOs who heard about this were asking me about it. But I still was like, "No. No CEO's going to budget a line item for the story. That's not a thing." So I just didn't do it for a really long time until eventually I was proven wrong about that.

Lenny (00:07:13):
And how many years ago was this at this point?

Andy Raskin (00:07:15):
So this was dot com. This was like '98 when I was pitching that company.

Lenny (00:07:20):
Amazing. I think there's a couple interesting tidbits about this. One is that interesting opportunities arise when you're doing something you're excited about. So you had the startup, it didn't work out, but you had a problem that you solved for yourself and that led to another, a bigger opportunity for your career.

Andy Raskin (00:07:34):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:07:35):
So that's interesting. And then also just some of the best opportunities arise from solving your own problem, not planning to start something with it, but just like, "I have a problem." Turns out [inaudible 00:07:44]-

Andy Raskin (00:07:44):
Yeah, I think that's same with you. Right, Lenny? You started writing about stuff and boom, that became the thing.

Lenny (00:07:49):
Absolutely. It was not quite boom, but eventually it became boom.

Andy Raskin (00:07:53):
Feels like boom from outside.

Lenny (00:07:55):
Yeah, that's how it goes. It always overnight for everyone else that isn't here.

Andy Raskin (00:08:01):
Right, exactly.

Lenny (00:08:03):
Yeah. Okay, so let's get into it. So you help CEOs at this point come up with what you call a strategic narrative and you help them not only come up with this strategic narrative, but you help their teams align around this strategic narrative. So let's just start with what is a strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:08:19):
Yeah, you'd think, I've been doing this for 10 years, I'd have a very snappy definition of it there, and I don't know if I'm really happy with ... like I've ever found one that totally gets at it yet. The one thing I say is it's this one story that the CEO uses to drive success in marketing, sales, but also product. That it becomes like a north star, strategic north star for product roadmap, for fundraising, for recruiting, really everything.

Andy Raskin (00:08:54):
What I think is really interesting as a kind of qualifier is that this story has a certain structure. Like I said, when I found those screenwriting books, I sort of shifted the structure. And the traditional structure, the way I learned how to pitch in business school, I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatment.

Andy Raskin (00:09:24):
Not to say it's not better, but just this is the structure of it, and it kind of sets you up for bragging. Let me tell you why it's so great. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. In the movies, every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, in the character's world. And I call this shift the shift from the old game to the new game. And the archetypal example of this, I think in the business world is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over," meaning software in the sense that we're going to own it and maintain it, "And there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, like the new rules, everything has changed and that's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:10:34):
I think the Salesforce example is an awesome example of your approach. If they were thinking about it in the old way, what would Salesforce have done? How would they have pitched it if not for, "Everyone's moving to the cloud, your dumb for using desktop software,"?

Andy Raskin (00:10:48):
Well, I think they would've just come out and said like, "Oh hey ..." I mean CRM by the way, was already a category. I mean, already Siebel was the huge giant of that space. There were already even companies doing it online, doing it through the web. And so they would've come and said, "Oh, we're easier to install, faster to get up and running than Siebel," or, "We have this much functionality compared to," I think it was, was it NetSuite? Or, I don't know. It was some early Salesforce-like thing that was out there. They would've done these sort of comparison things.

Andy Raskin (00:11:25):
And Benioff, I mean he is a pretty proud guy. I think he did still say like, "Hey, we're the number one CRM," but wasn't what they led with. They led with this story about this fundamental paradigm shift and, are you in or are you not in? And what they did was instead of just saying, "Hey, we're better than," they said, "Hey, all those others, those Siebel's, they're part of that old game. You want to play that software game? Be my guest, go buy Siebel," and of course we know how it played out.

Lenny (00:12:02):
So the crux of the approach is instead of, "Problem, solution, you should go do this," it's, "The world is changing, here's where it's going and we're going to help you get there." I want go in a little more depth of the framework. But before that, what are some other examples to give people a sense of like, oh, I see, I understand what this might be.

Andy Raskin (00:12:19):
Yeah, so another great example and no coincidence, so is Zuora. So Zuora is the company I wrote about in this post called The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen, the CEO of Zuora, Tien Tzuo, was employee number 11 at Salesforce. So he learns this from Benioff. And he's pitching, "Hey, in the old world, businesses operated on transactions. You sold things to people outright. In this new world," he calls it the subscription economy, where people want the benefits of those things without necessarily having to pay for them. And of course gives all these examples of all the winners in this, look at all the winning companies. They're all basically going to this new model.

Andy Raskin (00:13:05):
And so he's pitching someone like Ford and you can imagine they're going to Ford and pitching a subscription for car service, which is quite different from just a lease. And they're starting out with this. This is the big shift. Another one, team I worked with early on, and I think they'd agree their story came out of this work was Gong. So Gong everyone probably knows by now, they take the video recordings of all your sales calls and they stick AI onto it and come out with all these insights. And that story is, hey, goodbye opinions. Used to be a world where sales is run on opinions. Hello reality, that now all the winners are adopting this new mindset where we really have to see what's really going on.

Lenny (00:13:56):
In the Gong example, let's say, what would they have done if they were going, "Here's the problem, here's the solution, here's what we're going to do for you,"?

Andy Raskin (00:14:03):
Yeah, I mean that's kind of what they were doing when they started out. And I'm not saying that didn't work totally. I mean already by the time they started doing this, they were starting to become a big company. I remember Bendov said to me, "Listen, Andy," they were around series B, I think this is around 2018. It's like, "We're going to be a huge company. The question is how huge. And I think that this narrative along the lines of Zuora or Salesforce, if we get this right, this is going to be a multiplier on our growth."

Andy Raskin (00:14:38):
So I don't remember exactly the pitch beforehand, but it was very much like, "Hey, we're going to record your calls. We're going to get insights from them. They're better than the insights you could get from Salesforce." There wasn't this kind of unifying kind of movement ideology that put it all in context. And what was really interesting was one thing, I don't think they'd be upset if I shared, and maybe it's known. Initially, they were seen as a tool for sales operations, for someone who's going to record the calls and what this narrative did for them. And I think it was already starting to happen, but what it really coalesced was this is a tool for sales leadership.

Lenny (00:15:23):
You talked about Zuora in the post you wrote, and I imagine many people listening are like, "Oh, shit. This is the guy that wrote that post that everyone's always sharing with me about how to make a deck." And I wanted to ask, how impactful was that one piece of writing for you in your career, just like as a tangent?

Andy Raskin (00:15:39):
I had written some other posts on Medium in particular. Medium has changed quite a bit, but back then I found that I could write stuff there and get really a lot of people who were interested in what I was interested would sort of come in and create some noise about it. So I was already doing this kind of work for a couple of years, but that post immediately got something like 2 million views around the world and I started getting inquiries from teams all over the world.

Andy Raskin (00:16:12):
And it was I think what really allowed me to say no, okay, I could do this work. That CEO's would budget a line item for this. Because I think if you really understand that post, it's not really about a sales deck, it's really about this story that Tien, the CEO is telling everywhere and that is showing up in the sales deck and structuring it that way.

Lenny (00:16:40):
I think it's just another example that comes up a bunch on this podcast is just the power of writing and the power of content. Yeah, and you're shaking your head.

Andy Raskin (00:16:48):
Totally. I mean, I had a little mini career as a journalist, as a freelance writer and I really loved that. I actually, I took a class in New York called How to Write a Magazine Article, because I was sort of mid-career, I was curious. And the class wound up being more about how to sell a magazine article. And I found I really loved that, pitching articles, but one thing that was always a downer for me was there's always this editor sort of deciding what's going to be out there.

Andy Raskin (00:17:23):
And when you work with a great editor, it's great, they make yourself better and they're priceless. But still there's this intermediary. What started to happen, I think around when I started writing around 2013, '14, you start to see these platforms, like Medium, even LinkedIn where you can just write and have this audience and I think no way I could do this, the work I do if that development hadn't happened first.

Lenny (00:17:53):
I'm taking us off track, but I want to go a little deeper with this. I find that there's kind of two paths to writing online. One is your path where you write one piece that just blows up like crazy. The other path is more my path where I just write consistently for a long time, and both work and most people try to go your path and they never succeed. It's really hard to make something gets 2 million views, but you can go that path.

Andy Raskin (00:18:14):
This is like you said earlier, hey, it seems like boom, but really it didn't. So that was probably the 30th or 40th piece and they were gradually getting more and more traction. There was one I wrote before that about, it's kind of dissecting Elon Musk's pitch for the Powerwall, the battery that they sell. And that one got maybe few hundred thousand views and also was a big jump. And then the next one got some poultry number. So what I find is like, yeah, there's this a while where you're writing and it feels like you're talking to nobody and then gradually it grows and you'll have these peaks, but then over time is where the magic is.

Lenny (00:19:03):
Okay, I'm really glad you pointed that out, that it rarely is just you write one thing and it's boom.

Andy Raskin (00:19:08):
I'll also say, sorry, because I worked in a magazine, I haven't done a newsletter because that idea of having a deadline all the time and constantly having to, we used to call the magazine Feed the Beast, I feel so free not to have that. So for now at least I haven't done that.

Lenny (00:19:27):
I know that well, so let me take us back on track and let's talk about just the high level framework here. So you talked about, it starts with this idea of tell people worlds changing, join this movement. What's the simple way to think about this, the pieces of this strategic narrative framework?

Andy Raskin (00:19:42):
A lot of times people will contact me, say, "Hey, I tried it, didn't work." Well, one very common thing, at least earlier was they would basically just take the Zuora deck, they'd get ahold of it and just put their logo on it. And so that's not going to work. One thing is we're not just saying, "Hey, the world is changing." And then sometimes I'll see, "The world is changing," and there'll be, "Used to be," and there's a long list of things and then, "Now it is," a long list of bullet points.

Andy Raskin (00:20:11):
What's really, I think key is naming it, naming that old game. The examples you saw, software, cloud, transactions, subscription opinions, reality. This very, very concise naming is really key. And it's hard because in making it compact you're losing completeness. So you can imagine you're in a meeting, someone says like, "Hey, how about we do transactions to subscriptions?" And someone says, "Well I don't know, there's a lot of things I don't really subscribe to. Subscription economy, really?" So we're always kind of overstating it in a way, but it's not a problem. I don't think people say like, "Oh that's wrong, subscription economy, because I still go to the grocery store and buy things." So anyway, that's the first piece.

Andy Raskin (00:20:59):
The second piece is what I call naming the stakes. And there's a few ways to do this, but one that's really great if we can do it is to name the winners to show that winners are already playing this new game. So for instance with Zuora they're saying, "Hey, look, look at all the new winners," this is like 2015 so, "Airbnb, Box," all these companies, they're already doing this subscription thing.

Andy Raskin (00:21:28):
And by the way, overall they show this scary stat about the longevity of Fortune 500 companies. It's getting smaller, and so it's a little disingenuous, but basically they make this case that, "Hey, companies are dying, the ones that are winning are doing this." And so to the extent we want to make this life and death just like a movie. This is again, I'll make the parallel to Star Wars. So Luke, he spends the first 15 minutes of the movie belly aching. He wants to be a pilot, he wants to go out and have adventures in space. So Obiwan comes, he says, "Hey, we got this mission, this princess we got to go," and all this stuff, "Let's go. I'll teach you to be a pilot. We'll go have adventures in space." What does Luke say? He says, "Ooh, you know what, I can't really get involved. They got to go home. It's late." Who does this sound like? The reluctant buyer.

Andy Raskin (00:22:27):
So yeah, "I want to be innovative and all this. Ooh, you know what? I don't have budget this quarter." So how does George Lucas change Luke's mind? He basically kills the aunt and uncle, sorry, spoilers, it's been 40 years though. If you haven't seen it, you're probably not going to see it. Kills the aunt and uncle. Now it's pretty clear they're coming for Luke. Now the stakes are life and death. Probably he's going to be dead. But there is this other path that Obiwan holds out for him.

Andy Raskin (00:22:55):
And whenever I work with teams and I talk about this, so they're like, "Okay, I guess we got to then for kill the prospect's aunt and uncle," and basically yes, I mean figuratively. We got to show them that the future is not going to just be sort of okay. People talk about making it emotional and I've always wondered, what does that mean? Literally, what is the definition? This is for me the definition, is that the prospect doesn't see the future as sort of okay. They see it as split between a very negative outcome and a potentially very positive outcome.

Andy Raskin (00:23:29):
The third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game. I used to call it the promised land message, but I've changed it to this because I've found that it's sort of a little more fruitful. This subscription economy, transactions, it can get a little highfalutin and sort of big, but on the website when we just have to boil it down to a couple of words that's going to be clear right away, what can we say? And I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers. Very simple. It just sort of flows from it. Airbnb for a while had this one, live anywhere. If you think about-

Lenny (00:24:21):
Belong anywhere.

Andy Raskin (00:24:23):
Well actually it was-

Lenny (00:24:24):
Oh, live like a human.

Andy Raskin (00:24:25):
So you're right, it was, "Belong anywhere," and then it switched to, "Live there." I may have the chronology wrong, but it was the two of those things. You know better than I do. But either one, I mean think they're saying very similar things. Hey, there's this new world where you don't have to live in hotels, you can stay in people's houses. What's the object of that game is to belong anywhere, but live there. And I love it when it works that way where it's almost like an asymptotically unachievable thing. You are never literally going to live there. And if you think about it, this buyer mission statement, this rallying cry, I think of it really as the mission of the company. I mean, what is the mission of Airbnb other than to help people live there if they're going to be customer focused and all that?

Andy Raskin (00:25:17):
The fourth piece is, okay, well this object of the game, winning this game, it better be hard because if it's not, why would we even exist? Just with the movie, if Luke can just go destroy the Death Star then no movie. So there's got to be sort of obstacles in the way, things that are preventing them from. So saying, "Okay, you want to turn customers into subscribers." So whereas Zuora, where they go next is to say, "Okay, well how are you going to measure lifetime value?" Because now you have this always on thing. "How are you going to measure preferences and how they're changing over?" All these new kind of challenges that didn't exist before. And then these are like the monsters in Lord of the Rings or the Empire in Star Wars, these are the obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:26:11):
I think about them because they sound like problems. This is what people would normally say, "Oh, these are the problems we solve." But by setting up this story thing first we've repackaged them as obstacles to a new goal state that we've already positioned as life and death. So they take on this much more emotional meaning. We understand why they matter. And then of course the last piece is now talking about, well, how are we going to overcome these obstacles? Narrative people, in the movie business they call these the magic gifts that the main character gets to go help them win. What are the ways? Now we can talk about that and success stories and all the rest of the stuff.

Lenny (00:26:58):
There's some obvious parallels to the hero's journey here. I imagine that it was a source of inspiration, and the Star Wars I think is the epitome of that journey. Can you talk about just how related those two are, how you think about that?

Andy Raskin (00:27:09):
Yeah, I mean so hero's journey is this book that comes from, I think it's Hero of A Thousand Faces is a book by Joseph Campbell, a sociologist. He looks at myths over different cultures and different times and he finds this kind of common structure that he calls the hero's journey. I mean it's some controversy about that, about his book. Is it a very male oriented sort of take on things and a bunch of things.

Andy Raskin (00:27:38):
But even that aside, I found when I would talk about hero's journey and stuff, it's just like, it didn't really tell me what to do. Yeah, okay, yeah I got to do this pitch. So in the hero's journey there's like refusal of the call. That's actually that thing where Luke says he doesn't want to go and where the buyer says, "Hey, I don't have budget." But I don't know, it was just too theoretical for me to really ... when I use it, people seem to sort of glass over. So I just don't really talk about that at all. But yeah, I mean that's behind a lot of this stuff for sure.

Lenny (00:28:17):
Yeah, that makes sense because I think if people hear about that all the time when they're like, become a better storyteller, tell your story in this hero's journey, and it's like, "I don't know what I'm doing."

Andy Raskin (00:28:25):
Also, I would say there's storytelling as a skill kind of thing, which is a great thing. Learn how to tell stories better, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not really interested in that in my work, what I'm interested in is the one story and the structure of that one story. And this one story, it doesn't really have ... like, the world is moved from transactions to subscriptions. There's not a main character in that story who's like having a problem and getting saved. It's almost as if what's happening is we're turning the person we talk to into the main character. By spelling out the shift, we're changing their world and we're saying, "Hey, you got to change and you want to come with us."

Lenny (00:29:13):
It's almost like you're putting them into the hero's journey, like, "Here's how you win."

Andy Raskin (00:29:16):
Exactly. I love that.

Lenny (00:29:18):
Let me just try to summarize what you shared, this five step framework. So you start with here's a new movement that's happening and you want to name it, you want to name the stakes and there's winners and losers and here's already happening and it's really important. Then you want to name the object of the new game, like turning customers into subscribers. Then show the obstacles, here's why it's challenging, and then talk about how you're going to overcome these obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:29:41):
And by the way, the naming of the object of the new game, I find it often is really nice to do it as a question. So we hey, there's this shift from transactions to subscriptions and look, everyone's doing it. So we asked a simple question, what would it take to turn every customer into a subscriber? And this way we're kind of bringing the person we're pitching to almost like they're coming along with us as a co, I don't know, adventurer in crafting this story.

Lenny (00:30:17):
I love that. This episode is brought to you by Eco. Last month Eco users earned an average of $84 in cash back rewards. How? With Eco the future of personal finance. Eco is the update to a misaligned financial system providing an app that works just like your bank but removes almost all of the middlemen, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time automatically.

Lenny (00:30:40):
What if you earn rewards for paying your rent or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online or even earn rewards for saving each month? And then imagine if you got rewarded again just for getting rewarded. With Eco, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cash back plus Eco's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are Eco points, the world's first open reward system. You earn them whenever you do almost anything in the eco app. Eco is working to make these points the most rewarding points ever so it pays to be early.

Lenny (00:31:13):

Lenny's podcast listeners who attend an Eco welcome session will get an exclusive 4% APY on deposits over $1,000. Learn more at Eco.com/Lenny, that's E-C-O.com/Lenny. Maybe just to reinforce this even more, what if we go through the five steps and just with one company as an example and just talk about what each of those were for them?

Andy Raskin (00:31:41):
Okay, great. So there's a company called 360Learning. So this company, I don't know if folks know, but this company is raised over $200 million. They're in the space of corporate training software. So big companies, they have to train their people on all kinds of stuff. So you want to go through that one?

Lenny (00:32:01):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Andy Raskin (00:32:03):
Okay, great. By the way, Nick Hernandez is the CEO and Nick's been on my podcast, so he's talked about this. So they for a long time were pitching themselves as collaborative learning. So they have features that let people sort of collaborate on courses and all kinds of stuff. And Nick is often pitching CEOs, of course his team is as well. And he told me that it was sort of falling a little bit flat. People, collaborative learning, whatever. How are you different from this learning platform, this learning platform?

Andy Raskin (00:32:42):
And so when we worked together this collaborative learning, it's almost like a category name or a descriptor or something. They were so embedded that I decided, I don't even want to take it out, but can we define it in terms of a story? So the story they came to was, hey, used to be that companies train their people through basically a mindset of top-down learning. There's going to be some learning guru at the company, they're going to get all the courses, they're going to put it all together and sort of send out this training material to everybody.

Andy Raskin (00:33:23):
What's happening now is winning companies are approaching this differently. They're adopting this approach we might call upskill from within, which is if you look at Google, there's this page where I think you can go, it's a public. You can connect with Google's AI experts. They literally turn their internal experts into champions that are educating, not even just the company but even external people. They've created this culture of our own people are going to be the educators. So that's the shift from top down to this upskill from within. And of course I just even started to do the second piece which was like, hey, look at the big companies who are doing this.

Andy Raskin (00:34:10):
And then I think they showed, "Hey, you're not doing this. Look, training is becoming very expensive. People don't care. So this is the downside. So we're creating these sort of stake ..." And also I think he has something about how training now, like companies, if you don't adapt, if you can't get these skills to your people, if you're a car company and you can't get these skills around electric cars, you're dead.

Andy Raskin (00:34:35):
Nick was in France and he saw this poster, a recruiting poster from McDonald's and it said, "Hey, if you work at McDonald's you're going to learn from everybody else on your team." And it was like, wow, there it is. So there's another example we used as a kind of winner example. And so then the question became, I can't remember exactly, it was something like, how do you upskill from within? What would it take for you to turn your experts into champions of learning in the company and turn them into stars, and all this?

Andy Raskin (00:35:06):
And then I'm going to forget here what all the obstacles were. But I think it was things like, well, how are you going to make it possible for anybody to create a course? People who might have expertise in electric engines but don't know how to create a course, how are you going to make sure that there's still the learning department, they're going to keep control and can ... all this. You can imagine all the different kind of questions. And then of course now 360Learning starts talking about all that stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:35:36):
What Nick has told me, I'm actually going to be on a webinar with Nick where someone asked me, "Could you bring in a CEO who could talk about this stuff? Not just you B blabbing on about strategic narrative." And so Nick is going to join it. And we had a dress rehearsal the other day and he was telling me it's just like when he starts with this now he doesn't even get the question anymore of well how are you different from this other learning platform? Which used to always be the thing. It's just a much more seamless, okay, yeah, talk to our learning people, get this going. So it's just sounds like it's been really effective for them.

Lenny (00:36:13):
That's actually was what I was going to ask next is what kind of impact have you seen with someone shifting their pitch story from this doc? What was the arrogant doctor approach to the strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:36:23):
Yeah, I mean it's always this kind of thing I hear. I mean, of course it's very difficult to measure this. I mean, what was the value of the strategic narrative for Gong and its growth? Was it 3X versus 1X, 2X? Or I don't, who knows, right? But the things I hear from CEOs, a few things. One is that when they're pitching, they're not pitching features out of context, they're pitching now a movement which is a lot better place to be, I think. In a way you're not pitching product. Product is like a prop for making the story come true. Very important prop, but there's this higher level overlay that becomes the focus of the conversation, at first, and of course we're going to get into product and that helps sell. Once we have this story then everything in marketing can be all about this story.

Andy Raskin (00:37:21):
With Zuora, if you look at their website, well when they first started doing this, maybe 80% of the content is not, "Hey, let me tell you about how Zuora is so great," or, "Here's our new release," or whatever. It's, "Here's how music companies are embracing subscriptions. Here's how luxury goods companies are embracing subscriptions." It's all these kind of almost trend pieces that become unlimited fodder. And again, you're not touting your ... it's less salesy, right?

Andy Raskin (00:37:51):
Another thing I just hear always, I just interviewed a CEO this morning for my podcast and this is the first thing he actually said was, "It becomes the strategic north star for the product." So what he was telling me, and this was actually a little unusual, I asked him, "Why did you come to me at first?" And of course I'd asked him that before, but he said something this time that was a little different from what I'd heard before. He said, "We are constantly getting feature requests through sales, through customer success. And we had sort of no way, bar to decide well what do we take on, what don't we take on? And this clearly has become our bar."

Andy Raskin (00:38:38):
If you think about it for 360Learning, does it help us upskill from within? It's in. Does it not? Or it's prioritized. Does it not? Less prioritized. Amit Bendov told me this directly, he said we exactly the same thing. He said, "We get a lot of requests for features and a lot of them are basically about opinions, some way to record opinions."

Lenny (00:39:04):
And this is Gong.

Andy Raskin (00:39:04):
"We're not going to do those." In Gong, yeah. "We're not going to do those."

Lenny (00:39:08):
Are there any companies out there that maybe aren't clients that you see as like, wow, these guys are nailing it and they're doing a great job of this strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:39:15):
Well, one that really comes to mind is, I mean it's been out there for a while, but Drift. Drift comes out with essentially like a chatbot for your website, which might be the 30th chatbot for your website. And they don't say, "Hey, here's why our chatbot is the best one." They start from a completely different place, which is, "Hey, used to be people would sort of wait around for you to get back to them. It was a world of later. They called it the world of forms. You put up a web form and you expect someone's going to fill it out and maybe wait a few days while you take your sweet time deciding if you're going to get back to them."

Andy Raskin (00:39:58):
And David Cancel and David Gerhardt started from right the beginning saying, "Now we're in a world of now, where buyers are ..." I think they showed this woman, I remember it was this woman sleeping with her phone. That's your prospect. They're always on and they're going to expect you to be engaging with them right away. And they called this conversational marketing, and they really went with that and created I think a whole movement and they broke away from all of the other chatbots.

Lenny (00:40:35):
Awesome example. So earlier you threw out this word category, and I've noticed you haven't talked about category and category creation too much, and I think that you're kind of not a fan of this idea of creating a category and focusing on category. I'd love to hear your perspective on how that all relates to the stuff you recommend.

Andy Raskin (00:40:55):
Lenny, are you trying to get me in trouble? Like that guy who guy on your podcast who attacked jobs to be done?

Lenny (00:41:02):
Apparently, let's do it. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into.

Andy Raskin (00:41:06):
I would soften it a little bit and not just ... because I don't want the ire of the category design folks, but I really would soften and say, I wouldn't say I'm not a fan of creating category. Look, I think if you look at Play Bigger, which has become The Bible of that category creation thing, if you look behind that going to, what do they say the category is? They say it's a narrative. It's a story about how the world was to how it is. And so what I find though is that when people think about category creation, they tend to just focus on, okay, well, what is this category name going to be that we got? What are these three words or two words, whatever, that are going to magically make us seem like we're totally different from everybody else?

Andy Raskin (00:41:52):
And A, I think that's not really possible. These three words aren't going to do it. Take Gong, I mean already other companies were using this term revenue intelligence. With Gong, it suddenly becomes a thing because I think they have this opinions-to-reality story behind it. At one point, again, I asked Amit, he said, "Yeah," because I remember he really struggled, "What should we call it? What should we call it?"

Andy Raskin (00:42:20):
He came up with that one. But then when I asked him later, he is like, "Yeah, you know what? In hindsight we probably could have called it strawberry intelligence. It didn't matter. It was really the story that sort of mattered." I think he was exaggerating a little bit. And I think the category people would actually agree with this, I think they would agree with, hey, these three words are, it's sort of a shorthand for this movement of old game narrative.

Andy Raskin (00:42:48):
But I guess I feel like still by calling it category and category name, we're just focusing on those three words so much. And what happens often is CEOs will, they'll kind of come up with this little category, like what happened with Nick at the 360Learning with collaborative learning. We have this name, but we don't know how to tell the story around it. So my feeling is like, well, let's focus on the story. So that's why I talk about strategic narrative and movement creation versus category creation. If someone decides that your movement is a category, great. Bonus.

Lenny (00:43:32):
I see. So essentially your approach is category can play a part of this, but there's a bigger question you have of what's the story, what's the movement, what are the obstacles and categories and element of that potentially?

Andy Raskin (00:43:45):
I mean, I almost see them as orthogonal, like with HubSpot. HubSpot had this narrative around inbound. It used to be just outbound stuff, now we're going to have inbound. And that wasn't really a category. Back then they were probably known as marketing automation. Now they're probably known as CRM because they've broadened. But this movement is the thing that's sort of the constant and in some ways orthogonal to whatever category they're in.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Is the strategic narrative framework right for essentially any company or is there a sweet spot? And I've noticed most of the companies you've been talking about are B2B SaaS. So I don't know, maybe if there's a spectrum of perfect fit for strategic narrative framework and then not a fit at all. What's along that spectrum?

Andy Raskin (00:44:33):
Yeah, well you can see, I mean it takes a little time to tell this story and you were kind of framing it a little bit and we're telling it in lots of different channels. So I think it does really play well in this enterprise sales context because also we have a group buyer there. So it's not just one person who's doing some research. This whole group has to have a uniting story. So I think you're right that in noticing that the companies that this tends to resonate with tend to be B2B, enterprise sales, technology I think because often the product is very complicated. That arrogant doctor stuff comes from an age when the things people were selling were products on shelves that didn't change much, cans of soup at the supermarket or a car in a dealership. Even software back then, shrink-wrapped in a box, doesn't change.

Andy Raskin (00:45:44):
B2B software, this stuff is changing by the minute. And does it even make sense to make a claim to say, "Oh, we have these features and they have those features, therefore we're better," does that make any sense? That said, hey, I was looking for a sports watch, a Fitbit and I'm comparing specs and I'm doing all that stuff. And so that mode of buying is still happening, but I think, so yeah, when consumer products companies contact me, I usually say, "No." Occasionally they still say, "Okay, yeah, we'll build this, we still want to have this narrative." But yeah, I think it has the most value, most impactful right away for B2B enterprise technology companies.

Lenny (00:46:33):
Just a few more questions. One is just what's a sign that you should spend time in this area, that something is broken in your strategic narrative story pitch?

Andy Raskin (00:46:42):
Well, I can tell you what I hear from CEOs when they contact me. I always ask, what's happening? Because that idea I had, no CEO's going to budget a line item for this. I'm basically asking, why was I wrong? So a few things they tell me, one is that the company is maturing from a point a stage where they've been successful, but that success is ... one CEO put it this way, was brute force of the founders. So the founders are in every meeting, they're in every product discussion, every sales call, and that's shifting, the company's getting bigger.

Andy Raskin (00:47:21):
Usually I'm seeing this around series B where the company is getting ... so they can't be in every sales call, every market call and they're looking to transmit all the good stuff and some direction in a way that people are going to remember and all that. Everything from how we pitch to what the product should be and all that, and they see this as that.

Andy Raskin (00:47:47):
There's another point that I see people contacting me at, which is where they're growing. It's usually a bit later where they've scaled tremendously successfully. Now we're either acquiring or building out whole new product units. And that old story we told is just, it's just not big enough and we got to expand it to something bigger. This is the example of OneTrust, which the CEO I had on my podcast recently. Starts out with just, I think it's data privacy around the regulations that people have to be able to say, "Don't track me," things like that. And then they buy these other company and now we have this much bigger offering. So how do we tell the story? And then I guess the third one is some form of pivot where hey, we were telling an old story but whatever, the market changed or whatever and we want to go in a different direction.

Lenny (00:48:53):
Say a founders listening to this and they're like, "Okay, I realize I need to do this. I haven't spent enough time on this. Something's not working. This could be a huge unlock for us." What are the first couple steps they could take to start to figure this out? And I imagine at some point it's like, go talk to Andy. He'll help you through this. Is there stuff you can do on your own? How do you go about figuring this out?

Andy Raskin (00:49:11):
Well, a lot of folks have emailed me over the years like, well I told you before, there were some who emailed me like, "Hey, tried it, didn't work." But many more have emailed me, "Hey, I tried it, it did work. Thank you." And so yeah, just try to lay out that structure and try it mean even when I work with teams, I adapt what people might call sort of lean approach. I want to get that thing out there into sales calls. We're not rolling it out to the whole sales team right away, but getting it out into some sales calls and get a sense, "Hey, is this resonating? Are people given the nods?"

Andy Raskin (00:49:49):
Ideally by the way, one way I look to test it, is it working, is when we talk about this shift and the stakes and do they stick. Do they kind of say, "Yeah, let me tell you how that's playing out for us,"? Or, "Am I? Yes, I'm seeing that." Sometimes I'll literally, I'll train salespeople to ask them that question, like, "Am I crazy or are you seeing this?" And what do they say? And you can usually tell if they're in and it's qualitative. But I really like that kind of testing to see if it's working. And I think anybody can do that.

Lenny (00:50:32):
Is there a template or guide you have online for folks to follow other than maybe just listening to this podcast and reading? Is there a post that's like, "Here's the framework defined, and go follow these steps,"?

Andy Raskin (00:50:41):
I mean, I guess the closest is that The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen post, which is the Zuora deck. But even there, people have asked me for a framework and presentation companies say, "Can we have your template so we could make it available to people? We'll revenue share with you or something." And I am so against this template. Every team I work with, it's different. It's not the same number of slides. Sometimes we can lay out this shift in one slide, sometimes it just feels better or the team likes it better, whatever, if it's a few and we're sort of getting people into it. Sometimes there's no slides. So I am really hesitant to recommend any template. And what I'd say is these are principles for building it, not any prescribed formula.

Lenny (00:51:37):
If they do want to reach out to you while we're on this topic, what's the best way to contact you?

Andy Raskin (00:51:42):
Connect with me on LinkedIn. That's usually a good one. And I'm usually posting things on LinkedIn that I've learned from working with other teams.

Lenny (00:51:52):
Awesome. Last question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Speaking of LinkedIn, you posted how in a working session with companies that the second session is always this low point they all go through and that everyone's starting to get discouraged and pained. And first of all, I love the expectation setting. You're like, "This is going to suck initially and it'll get better." Why is that the low point and what is it that they focus on in that second session?

Andy Raskin (00:52:17):
Well, apparently I'm not doing enough of an expectation setting, because what that post was about was this woman. So when I work with a CEO I always ask them to create what I call a strategic narrative team of up to four people. And usually those are leads of marketing, sales, whatever. In this case, the CFO was a really important person in this company. And so the CEO wanted her as part of this team. And she said to me at the end, she's like, "I love where we got to." I always ask, "What worked? What didn't work?" And she's like, "I love where we got to. That worked great. What didn't work was like, you told us that this second session was going to be bad, but I think you could have drilled home more like exactly how bad."

Andy Raskin (00:52:58):
And then I asked her, "Actually, could I have that quote with your face on a slide that I now present to future teams?" She said, "Yeah, you could do that." So the way I work it is I have a kickoff session where essentially I'm asking people on the team, what are these pieces? What is this old game, new game shift? How do we talk about when to set the stakes and everything I just took you through? And we have like five people in the room. There's going to be ... we're going to come out of this with notes and notes, boards and boards of ideas of this stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:53:34):
And so then two things happen. One is I ask the team to start interviewing customers about how they see this shift and sometimes the customers will literally give us the words and that can be helpful in sort of aligning if we have differences. But I also start working with the CEO one-on-one and we build a first version of this thing, and it's the second session where we present this first version to the team and think about what's happening.

Andy Raskin (00:54:02):
The team has just given us millions of gold ideas, truly they're all ... and in order to make something sort of clean and powerful, the CO and I have had to pretty much throw out all of them, save one or two. And there's going to be feelings about that, first of all. Second of all, if this were easy to just get all ... interview everybody, come up with it, they would've done it. So it's going to be wrong.

Andy Raskin (00:54:30):
But the good news is this is where the team gets to weigh in. I also ask, what's working, not working in this thing? And when we learn how it's not working, that gives us the juice to then me and the CEO go back to the drawing board. We plan on this in advance, we're going to go back to the drawing board and then bring up something good. So having a shit draft is a million times more valuable than having all these great ideas. But it's also really painful. It's painful not only for them, but for me. No matter how many times I say this, I expect they're going to love it in that first one too. And I'm really pissed off when they don't. But luckily now I've done enough times I know that's going to happen.

Lenny (00:55:20):
I was just watching a documentary about Annie Lamont who came up with the first draft concept for writers that I stick to.

Andy Raskin (00:55:27):
I'm a firm believer in that. Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:30):
As you're talking, one last thought that I had is, so you'd work with because and founders. I feel like this could be just as useful to product leaders, product managers working on a product that they're launching, just like what is the movement, where it's happening, here's why this product's important. Do you find that too?

Andy Raskin (00:55:45):
Absolutely. And very frequently, the product leader, chief product officer is part of this group. What I'd say though is that the reason ... so after I did this work for a few years, I looked back and I was like, which were the engagements I did where I can see it, and the narrative is really this true north star for everything?

Andy Raskin (00:56:10):
It was always the ones where the CEO was leading it, not just in name, but literally the person who called me who was working on the drafts with me and going through. And so initially I didn't insist that it would be the CEO doing that, but eventually I started to, and I think even for a product leader, you're going to want the support. You don't want to be just telling that story in product. You're going to want that supported from this Zuora person who gave me the initial deck, he said it, "It was like I had air cover and I was just going down and knocking down deals on the ground." You're going to want that air cover in marketing, sales, recruiting, everything. And how much better is it if it's really driven by the CEO and you have that?

Lenny (00:57:01):
Amazing. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on or you want to share before we get to our very exciting lighting round?

Andy Raskin (00:57:07):
No, except I love category design people and it's really just sort of terms that I like that are ... you know what? Forget it. Scratch that part.

Lenny (00:57:19):
I thought that was funny.

Andy Raskin (00:57:21):
Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, we could leave it in. We could leave it in. You could even leave this in where I'm telling you to scratch it.

Lenny (00:57:26):
Sounds good. I was actually going to joke that I was going to cut this out and leave you hanging, but okay.

Andy Raskin (00:57:31):
No, you can do that. Yeah. Category design people. Love you. Don't hate me. Thank you.

Lenny (00:57:37):
Great. I love it. We're going to be okay, I think. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Andy Raskin (00:57:46):
I'm ready. I saw like what you sent them, but I didn't really look at them, so I'm just going to tell you what I said. I'll go off that.

Lenny (00:57:52):
Perfect. Excellent. The best version of this. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Andy Raskin (00:57:59):
One of the books that I read initially from that Barnes & Noble, it was Story by Robert McKee. I think a lot of people know about it who are sort of interested in story stuff, but it's kind of a Bible of people who are doing screenwriting and stuff. If anyone who's in Hollywood who thought about going to Hollywood, they know about this book. I love a book called Out of Sheer Rage. It's really not about what I do or anything, but the author is Geoff Dyer. Geoff, he's written a lot of books that are kind of essay memoir, and this is a book about him trying to write a book about DH Lawrence. So it's all about procrastinating and like, "Oh, I'm supposed to write this book. I'm about to go on a trip somewhere. Should I bring the collected works of DH Lawrence with me on the trip because that'll help me start the book, but maybe I shouldn't because it's not going to ... Then I could come back refreshed without having ..." Basically, it's all that. It's this sort of in the head. I just really enjoy that book.

Lenny (00:58:59):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Andy Raskin (00:59:03):
Station 11. Station 11. That was just so beautiful to me.

Lenny (00:59:09):
Trippy. That was a trippy movie. Did not expect to go where it went. I usually ask what's a favorite interview question you like to ask, and I don't know how often you're interviewing people, but does anything come to mind when I ask that?

Andy Raskin (00:59:21):
Well, I can tell you one thing I ask when I speak with CEOs is I like to ask, what role has this narrative played in your leadership? How does it work in your leadership? And it's always really interesting for me to hear that, 'cause I often hear things that I don't expect.

Lenny (00:59:39):
What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you just really like?

Andy Raskin (00:59:43):
I recently got a Fitbit. I think I may have mentioned it earlier. I was looking for a product like that, and so far I'm really loving it.

Lenny (00:59:53):
Amazing. Have you tried other versions of Fitbits or that's the one that's working?

Andy Raskin (00:59:58):
I also ordered a Polar at the same time and wound up returning the Polar. Basically, it was just a little clunkier on my wrist, so I went with a Fitbit. Well, do you have one that you recommend instead?

Lenny (01:00:13):
I just have the Apple Watch and I've never tried a Fitbit and it gives me all this stuff that seems cool, but I've never gone further.

Andy Raskin (01:00:21):
I got the Fitbit like a week ago and I actually still am on the fence whether I bring it back to return it for the Apple Watch, so I'm enjoying it, but we'll see.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Okay. Final question. You're expert on presentations and I imagine you spend a lot of time in decks, and so just what's like one small change people can make to how they put together a deck or a presentation that will make their presentation a lot better?

Andy Raskin (01:00:41):
This is the one thing, make the title the takeaway of the slide so that the person looking at it has to do zero work to take away. So example, you'll sometimes see, "The problem," or, "The team." Replace, "The team," with, "Our team is veterans of whatever industry," or every single slide it's a takeaway, not a label. It'll make everything flow a lot better.

Lenny (01:01:17):
You did a killer job answering the lightning round questions without having a peek at what they were going to be. Andy, this was incredibly insightful. I'm going to go start working on my strategic narrative for my podcast and newsletter. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe consider working with you? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:01:35):
So I mentioned LinkedIn as a way to connect with me. That's fine. My website is AndyRaskin.com. I also have a podcast where I talk with CEOs, so if you're interested in hearing more details about actual use of this, it's called The Bigger Narrative. My mom introduces every episode. I sent her the interviews in advance. I call her and interview about what she thinks people will get out of it, and that conversation becomes the intro to the podcast episode. And what was the last question?

Lenny (01:02:04):
How can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:02:06):
Useful to me. Just if you try any of this stuff, let me know. Like, "Hey, worked. Didn't work. Have this question." I would love to hear that stuff.

Lenny (01:02:17):
Amazing. Andy, thank you again for being here.

Andy Raskin (01:02:20):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. This is really fun.

## Transcript

Andy Raskin (00:00:00):
The way I learned how to pitch in business school, and I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatments. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. Every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, and I call this shift the shift from the old game to a new game. The archetypal example of this, I think in the business world, is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over and there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, new rules. That's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:00:54):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Andy Raskin. Andy helps CEOs and company leaders align their teams around something he calls a strategic narrative, which as you'll learn all about in this episode, is essentially a simple story that helps people understand why they need your product. And with that helps you align your sales, marketing, and product teams along with your fundraising and even your hiring efforts.

Lenny (00:01:25):
Andy has worked closely with some of the most successful founders and companies out there, including companies like Gong, Dropbox, Uber, Salesforce, Square, IBM, and many others. In our conversation, Andy explains why most people are pitching their product completely wrong, why focusing on the problem you're solving for people is no longer an effective pitch and how the strategic narrative helps you frame your solution in a much more effective way. Andy also shares a ton of examples of the framework in action, why focusing on categories and category creation is so limiting, signs your narrative needs to work and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Andy Raskin after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:02:07):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing a roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

Lenny (00:02:45):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down.

Lenny (00:04:16):
Andy, welcome to the podcast.

Andy Raskin (00:04:18):
Oh, thanks Lenny. So great to talk with you.

Lenny (00:04:21):
You are quite known as someone that helps CEOs optimize their pitch, their story, their strategy, which we're going to get deep into. But before we do that, can you just give us a little glimpse into how you found your way into this line of work?

Andy Raskin (00:04:35):
I started as a coder. I was a computer science major, undergrad, a friend and I had an idea for an app. So this was like during the dot com years. So Windows app, and we coded a little prototype and we started, we put it out there, we started getting some users and we thought, "Oh, okay, maybe we can get some investments." So of the two of us, I spoke English fluently. So we decided, okay, I'll write the investor pitch. So I wrote the pitch, we sent it out and the reaction was really bad. One VC wrote back and said, "Listen, I rate every plan I get on a scale of 1 to 10, and yours is a 1," and the next to the one he wrote in parentheses, "Worst," in case we thought maybe that was the top of his rating scale.

Lenny (00:05:20):
Brutal.

Andy Raskin (00:05:22):
Yeah, brutal. But then lower down, so this was back when they would like you'd print, send the hard copy of the plan and they might mail it back with comments written in. And he had written in, "Not a compelling story." A few weeks later, I'm walking by this Barnes & Noble and there's a sign in the window that says, "For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story," okay, that's me. And there's an arrow that points to these books and they turned out to be screenwriting books. I didn't know anything about this, so I started reading these books and it strikes me a movie is a pitch. What is Star Wars a pitch for? It's a pitch for be good, care about people, trust The Force in their terms. But I don't have couple hours. I'm pitching a business. It's very different. I'm not writing a three X screenplay.

Andy Raskin (00:06:11):
So what applies, what doesn't apply? I mean these are questions I think I'm still asking, but I did my best to take some of the learnings of how the movie was structured. It was very different from how my pitch was structured and kind of restructure it. And we did that and we sent the pitch out and we start getting more interest. It was really clear. And then we had a term sheet I think a few months later and I'm like, "What is this story thing?" That we didn't change the product, it was basically the same business just sort of how we talked about it. That was really interesting to me.

Andy Raskin (00:06:49):
I mean, over the next 10, 15 years, I thought about, "Hey, maybe I could do consulting with this." CEOs who heard about this were asking me about it. But I still was like, "No. No CEO's going to budget a line item for the story. That's not a thing." So I just didn't do it for a really long time until eventually I was proven wrong about that.

Lenny (00:07:13):
And how many years ago was this at this point?

Andy Raskin (00:07:15):
So this was dot com. This was like '98 when I was pitching that company.

Lenny (00:07:20):
Amazing. I think there's a couple interesting tidbits about this. One is that interesting opportunities arise when you're doing something you're excited about. So you had the startup, it didn't work out, but you had a problem that you solved for yourself and that led to another, a bigger opportunity for your career.

Andy Raskin (00:07:34):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:07:35):
So that's interesting. And then also just some of the best opportunities arise from solving your own problem, not planning to start something with it, but just like, "I have a problem." Turns out [inaudible 00:07:44]-

Andy Raskin (00:07:44):
Yeah, I think that's same with you. Right, Lenny? You started writing about stuff and boom, that became the thing.

Lenny (00:07:49):
Absolutely. It was not quite boom, but eventually it became boom.

Andy Raskin (00:07:53):
Feels like boom from outside.

Lenny (00:07:55):
Yeah, that's how it goes. It always overnight for everyone else that isn't here.

Andy Raskin (00:08:01):
Right, exactly.

Lenny (00:08:03):
Yeah. Okay, so let's get into it. So you help CEOs at this point come up with what you call a strategic narrative and you help them not only come up with this strategic narrative, but you help their teams align around this strategic narrative. So let's just start with what is a strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:08:19):
Yeah, you'd think, I've been doing this for 10 years, I'd have a very snappy definition of it there, and I don't know if I'm really happy with ... like I've ever found one that totally gets at it yet. The one thing I say is it's this one story that the CEO uses to drive success in marketing, sales, but also product. That it becomes like a north star, strategic north star for product roadmap, for fundraising, for recruiting, really everything.

Andy Raskin (00:08:54):
What I think is really interesting as a kind of qualifier is that this story has a certain structure. Like I said, when I found those screenwriting books, I sort of shifted the structure. And the traditional structure, the way I learned how to pitch in business school, I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatment.

Andy Raskin (00:09:24):
Not to say it's not better, but just this is the structure of it, and it kind of sets you up for bragging. Let me tell you why it's so great. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. In the movies, every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, in the character's world. And I call this shift the shift from the old game to the new game. And the archetypal example of this, I think in the business world is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, "Hey, software is over," meaning software in the sense that we're going to own it and maintain it, "And there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, like the new rules, everything has changed and that's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there." This structure really is about defining a movement and that's very different from, "Hey, I'm going to solve your problem."

Lenny (00:10:34):
I think the Salesforce example is an awesome example of your approach. If they were thinking about it in the old way, what would Salesforce have done? How would they have pitched it if not for, "Everyone's moving to the cloud, your dumb for using desktop software,"?

Andy Raskin (00:10:48):
Well, I think they would've just come out and said like, "Oh hey ..." I mean CRM by the way, was already a category. I mean, already Siebel was the huge giant of that space. There were already even companies doing it online, doing it through the web. And so they would've come and said, "Oh, we're easier to install, faster to get up and running than Siebel," or, "We have this much functionality compared to," I think it was, was it NetSuite? Or, I don't know. It was some early Salesforce-like thing that was out there. They would've done these sort of comparison things.

Andy Raskin (00:11:25):
And Benioff, I mean he is a pretty proud guy. I think he did still say like, "Hey, we're the number one CRM," but wasn't what they led with. They led with this story about this fundamental paradigm shift and, are you in or are you not in? And what they did was instead of just saying, "Hey, we're better than," they said, "Hey, all those others, those Siebel's, they're part of that old game. You want to play that software game? Be my guest, go buy Siebel," and of course we know how it played out.

Lenny (00:12:02):
So the crux of the approach is instead of, "Problem, solution, you should go do this," it's, "The world is changing, here's where it's going and we're going to help you get there." I want go in a little more depth of the framework. But before that, what are some other examples to give people a sense of like, oh, I see, I understand what this might be.

Andy Raskin (00:12:19):
Yeah, so another great example and no coincidence, so is Zuora. So Zuora is the company I wrote about in this post called The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen, the CEO of Zuora, Tien Tzuo, was employee number 11 at Salesforce. So he learns this from Benioff. And he's pitching, "Hey, in the old world, businesses operated on transactions. You sold things to people outright. In this new world," he calls it the subscription economy, where people want the benefits of those things without necessarily having to pay for them. And of course gives all these examples of all the winners in this, look at all the winning companies. They're all basically going to this new model.

Andy Raskin (00:13:05):
And so he's pitching someone like Ford and you can imagine they're going to Ford and pitching a subscription for car service, which is quite different from just a lease. And they're starting out with this. This is the big shift. Another one, team I worked with early on, and I think they'd agree their story came out of this work was Gong. So Gong everyone probably knows by now, they take the video recordings of all your sales calls and they stick AI onto it and come out with all these insights. And that story is, hey, goodbye opinions. Used to be a world where sales is run on opinions. Hello reality, that now all the winners are adopting this new mindset where we really have to see what's really going on.

Lenny (00:13:56):
In the Gong example, let's say, what would they have done if they were going, "Here's the problem, here's the solution, here's what we're going to do for you,"?

Andy Raskin (00:14:03):
Yeah, I mean that's kind of what they were doing when they started out. And I'm not saying that didn't work totally. I mean already by the time they started doing this, they were starting to become a big company. I remember Bendov said to me, "Listen, Andy," they were around series B, I think this is around 2018. It's like, "We're going to be a huge company. The question is how huge. And I think that this narrative along the lines of Zuora or Salesforce, if we get this right, this is going to be a multiplier on our growth."

Andy Raskin (00:14:38):
So I don't remember exactly the pitch beforehand, but it was very much like, "Hey, we're going to record your calls. We're going to get insights from them. They're better than the insights you could get from Salesforce." There wasn't this kind of unifying kind of movement ideology that put it all in context. And what was really interesting was one thing, I don't think they'd be upset if I shared, and maybe it's known. Initially, they were seen as a tool for sales operations, for someone who's going to record the calls and what this narrative did for them. And I think it was already starting to happen, but what it really coalesced was this is a tool for sales leadership.

Lenny (00:15:23):
You talked about Zuora in the post you wrote, and I imagine many people listening are like, "Oh, shit. This is the guy that wrote that post that everyone's always sharing with me about how to make a deck." And I wanted to ask, how impactful was that one piece of writing for you in your career, just like as a tangent?

Andy Raskin (00:15:39):
I had written some other posts on Medium in particular. Medium has changed quite a bit, but back then I found that I could write stuff there and get really a lot of people who were interested in what I was interested would sort of come in and create some noise about it. So I was already doing this kind of work for a couple of years, but that post immediately got something like 2 million views around the world and I started getting inquiries from teams all over the world.

Andy Raskin (00:16:12):
And it was I think what really allowed me to say no, okay, I could do this work. That CEO's would budget a line item for this. Because I think if you really understand that post, it's not really about a sales deck, it's really about this story that Tien, the CEO is telling everywhere and that is showing up in the sales deck and structuring it that way.

Lenny (00:16:40):
I think it's just another example that comes up a bunch on this podcast is just the power of writing and the power of content. Yeah, and you're shaking your head.

Andy Raskin (00:16:48):
Totally. I mean, I had a little mini career as a journalist, as a freelance writer and I really loved that. I actually, I took a class in New York called How to Write a Magazine Article, because I was sort of mid-career, I was curious. And the class wound up being more about how to sell a magazine article. And I found I really loved that, pitching articles, but one thing that was always a downer for me was there's always this editor sort of deciding what's going to be out there.

Andy Raskin (00:17:23):
And when you work with a great editor, it's great, they make yourself better and they're priceless. But still there's this intermediary. What started to happen, I think around when I started writing around 2013, '14, you start to see these platforms, like Medium, even LinkedIn where you can just write and have this audience and I think no way I could do this, the work I do if that development hadn't happened first.

Lenny (00:17:53):
I'm taking us off track, but I want to go a little deeper with this. I find that there's kind of two paths to writing online. One is your path where you write one piece that just blows up like crazy. The other path is more my path where I just write consistently for a long time, and both work and most people try to go your path and they never succeed. It's really hard to make something gets 2 million views, but you can go that path.

Andy Raskin (00:18:14):
This is like you said earlier, hey, it seems like boom, but really it didn't. So that was probably the 30th or 40th piece and they were gradually getting more and more traction. There was one I wrote before that about, it's kind of dissecting Elon Musk's pitch for the Powerwall, the battery that they sell. And that one got maybe few hundred thousand views and also was a big jump. And then the next one got some poultry number. So what I find is like, yeah, there's this a while where you're writing and it feels like you're talking to nobody and then gradually it grows and you'll have these peaks, but then over time is where the magic is.

Lenny (00:19:03):
Okay, I'm really glad you pointed that out, that it rarely is just you write one thing and it's boom.

Andy Raskin (00:19:08):
I'll also say, sorry, because I worked in a magazine, I haven't done a newsletter because that idea of having a deadline all the time and constantly having to, we used to call the magazine Feed the Beast, I feel so free not to have that. So for now at least I haven't done that.

Lenny (00:19:27):
I know that well, so let me take us back on track and let's talk about just the high level framework here. So you talked about, it starts with this idea of tell people worlds changing, join this movement. What's the simple way to think about this, the pieces of this strategic narrative framework?

Andy Raskin (00:19:42):
A lot of times people will contact me, say, "Hey, I tried it, didn't work." Well, one very common thing, at least earlier was they would basically just take the Zuora deck, they'd get ahold of it and just put their logo on it. And so that's not going to work. One thing is we're not just saying, "Hey, the world is changing." And then sometimes I'll see, "The world is changing," and there'll be, "Used to be," and there's a long list of things and then, "Now it is," a long list of bullet points.

Andy Raskin (00:20:11):
What's really, I think key is naming it, naming that old game. The examples you saw, software, cloud, transactions, subscription opinions, reality. This very, very concise naming is really key. And it's hard because in making it compact you're losing completeness. So you can imagine you're in a meeting, someone says like, "Hey, how about we do transactions to subscriptions?" And someone says, "Well I don't know, there's a lot of things I don't really subscribe to. Subscription economy, really?" So we're always kind of overstating it in a way, but it's not a problem. I don't think people say like, "Oh that's wrong, subscription economy, because I still go to the grocery store and buy things." So anyway, that's the first piece.

Andy Raskin (00:20:59):
The second piece is what I call naming the stakes. And there's a few ways to do this, but one that's really great if we can do it is to name the winners to show that winners are already playing this new game. So for instance with Zuora they're saying, "Hey, look, look at all the new winners," this is like 2015 so, "Airbnb, Box," all these companies, they're already doing this subscription thing.

Andy Raskin (00:21:28):
And by the way, overall they show this scary stat about the longevity of Fortune 500 companies. It's getting smaller, and so it's a little disingenuous, but basically they make this case that, "Hey, companies are dying, the ones that are winning are doing this." And so to the extent we want to make this life and death just like a movie. This is again, I'll make the parallel to Star Wars. So Luke, he spends the first 15 minutes of the movie belly aching. He wants to be a pilot, he wants to go out and have adventures in space. So Obiwan comes, he says, "Hey, we got this mission, this princess we got to go," and all this stuff, "Let's go. I'll teach you to be a pilot. We'll go have adventures in space." What does Luke say? He says, "Ooh, you know what, I can't really get involved. They got to go home. It's late." Who does this sound like? The reluctant buyer.

Andy Raskin (00:22:27):
So yeah, "I want to be innovative and all this. Ooh, you know what? I don't have budget this quarter." So how does George Lucas change Luke's mind? He basically kills the aunt and uncle, sorry, spoilers, it's been 40 years though. If you haven't seen it, you're probably not going to see it. Kills the aunt and uncle. Now it's pretty clear they're coming for Luke. Now the stakes are life and death. Probably he's going to be dead. But there is this other path that Obiwan holds out for him.

Andy Raskin (00:22:55):
And whenever I work with teams and I talk about this, so they're like, "Okay, I guess we got to then for kill the prospect's aunt and uncle," and basically yes, I mean figuratively. We got to show them that the future is not going to just be sort of okay. People talk about making it emotional and I've always wondered, what does that mean? Literally, what is the definition? This is for me the definition, is that the prospect doesn't see the future as sort of okay. They see it as split between a very negative outcome and a potentially very positive outcome.

Andy Raskin (00:23:29):
The third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game. I used to call it the promised land message, but I've changed it to this because I've found that it's sort of a little more fruitful. This subscription economy, transactions, it can get a little highfalutin and sort of big, but on the website when we just have to boil it down to a couple of words that's going to be clear right away, what can we say? And I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers. Very simple. It just sort of flows from it. Airbnb for a while had this one, live anywhere. If you think about-

Lenny (00:24:21):
Belong anywhere.

Andy Raskin (00:24:23):
Well actually it was-

Lenny (00:24:24):
Oh, live like a human.

Andy Raskin (00:24:25):
So you're right, it was, "Belong anywhere," and then it switched to, "Live there." I may have the chronology wrong, but it was the two of those things. You know better than I do. But either one, I mean think they're saying very similar things. Hey, there's this new world where you don't have to live in hotels, you can stay in people's houses. What's the object of that game is to belong anywhere, but live there. And I love it when it works that way where it's almost like an asymptotically unachievable thing. You are never literally going to live there. And if you think about it, this buyer mission statement, this rallying cry, I think of it really as the mission of the company. I mean, what is the mission of Airbnb other than to help people live there if they're going to be customer focused and all that?

Andy Raskin (00:25:17):
The fourth piece is, okay, well this object of the game, winning this game, it better be hard because if it's not, why would we even exist? Just with the movie, if Luke can just go destroy the Death Star then no movie. So there's got to be sort of obstacles in the way, things that are preventing them from. So saying, "Okay, you want to turn customers into subscribers." So whereas Zuora, where they go next is to say, "Okay, well how are you going to measure lifetime value?" Because now you have this always on thing. "How are you going to measure preferences and how they're changing over?" All these new kind of challenges that didn't exist before. And then these are like the monsters in Lord of the Rings or the Empire in Star Wars, these are the obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:26:11):
I think about them because they sound like problems. This is what people would normally say, "Oh, these are the problems we solve." But by setting up this story thing first we've repackaged them as obstacles to a new goal state that we've already positioned as life and death. So they take on this much more emotional meaning. We understand why they matter. And then of course the last piece is now talking about, well, how are we going to overcome these obstacles? Narrative people, in the movie business they call these the magic gifts that the main character gets to go help them win. What are the ways? Now we can talk about that and success stories and all the rest of the stuff.

Lenny (00:26:58):
There's some obvious parallels to the hero's journey here. I imagine that it was a source of inspiration, and the Star Wars I think is the epitome of that journey. Can you talk about just how related those two are, how you think about that?

Andy Raskin (00:27:09):
Yeah, I mean so hero's journey is this book that comes from, I think it's Hero of A Thousand Faces is a book by Joseph Campbell, a sociologist. He looks at myths over different cultures and different times and he finds this kind of common structure that he calls the hero's journey. I mean it's some controversy about that, about his book. Is it a very male oriented sort of take on things and a bunch of things.

Andy Raskin (00:27:38):
But even that aside, I found when I would talk about hero's journey and stuff, it's just like, it didn't really tell me what to do. Yeah, okay, yeah I got to do this pitch. So in the hero's journey there's like refusal of the call. That's actually that thing where Luke says he doesn't want to go and where the buyer says, "Hey, I don't have budget." But I don't know, it was just too theoretical for me to really ... when I use it, people seem to sort of glass over. So I just don't really talk about that at all. But yeah, I mean that's behind a lot of this stuff for sure.

Lenny (00:28:17):
Yeah, that makes sense because I think if people hear about that all the time when they're like, become a better storyteller, tell your story in this hero's journey, and it's like, "I don't know what I'm doing."

Andy Raskin (00:28:25):
Also, I would say there's storytelling as a skill kind of thing, which is a great thing. Learn how to tell stories better, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not really interested in that in my work, what I'm interested in is the one story and the structure of that one story. And this one story, it doesn't really have ... like, the world is moved from transactions to subscriptions. There's not a main character in that story who's like having a problem and getting saved. It's almost as if what's happening is we're turning the person we talk to into the main character. By spelling out the shift, we're changing their world and we're saying, "Hey, you got to change and you want to come with us."

Lenny (00:29:13):
It's almost like you're putting them into the hero's journey, like, "Here's how you win."

Andy Raskin (00:29:16):
Exactly. I love that.

Lenny (00:29:18):
Let me just try to summarize what you shared, this five step framework. So you start with here's a new movement that's happening and you want to name it, you want to name the stakes and there's winners and losers and here's already happening and it's really important. Then you want to name the object of the new game, like turning customers into subscribers. Then show the obstacles, here's why it's challenging, and then talk about how you're going to overcome these obstacles.

Andy Raskin (00:29:41):
And by the way, the naming of the object of the new game, I find it often is really nice to do it as a question. So we hey, there's this shift from transactions to subscriptions and look, everyone's doing it. So we asked a simple question, what would it take to turn every customer into a subscriber? And this way we're kind of bringing the person we're pitching to almost like they're coming along with us as a co, I don't know, adventurer in crafting this story.

Lenny (00:30:17):
I love that. This episode is brought to you by Eco. Last month Eco users earned an average of $84 in cash back rewards. How? With Eco the future of personal finance. Eco is the update to a misaligned financial system providing an app that works just like your bank but removes almost all of the middlemen, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time automatically.

Lenny (00:30:40):
What if you earn rewards for paying your rent or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online or even earn rewards for saving each month? And then imagine if you got rewarded again just for getting rewarded. With Eco, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cash back plus Eco's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are Eco points, the world's first open reward system. You earn them whenever you do almost anything in the eco app. Eco is working to make these points the most rewarding points ever so it pays to be early.

Lenny (00:31:13):

Maybe just to reinforce this even more, what if we go through the five steps and just with one company as an example and just talk about what each of those were for them?

Andy Raskin (00:31:41):
Okay, great. So there's a company called 360Learning. So this company, I don't know if folks know, but this company is raised over $200 million. They're in the space of corporate training software. So big companies, they have to train their people on all kinds of stuff. So you want to go through that one?

Lenny (00:32:01):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Andy Raskin (00:32:03):
Okay, great. By the way, Nick Hernandez is the CEO and Nick's been on my podcast, so he's talked about this. So they for a long time were pitching themselves as collaborative learning. So they have features that let people sort of collaborate on courses and all kinds of stuff. And Nick is often pitching CEOs, of course his team is as well. And he told me that it was sort of falling a little bit flat. People, collaborative learning, whatever. How are you different from this learning platform, this learning platform?

Andy Raskin (00:32:42):
And so when we worked together this collaborative learning, it's almost like a category name or a descriptor or something. They were so embedded that I decided, I don't even want to take it out, but can we define it in terms of a story? So the story they came to was, hey, used to be that companies train their people through basically a mindset of top-down learning. There's going to be some learning guru at the company, they're going to get all the courses, they're going to put it all together and sort of send out this training material to everybody.

Andy Raskin (00:33:23):
What's happening now is winning companies are approaching this differently. They're adopting this approach we might call upskill from within, which is if you look at Google, there's this page where I think you can go, it's a public. You can connect with Google's AI experts. They literally turn their internal experts into champions that are educating, not even just the company but even external people. They've created this culture of our own people are going to be the educators. So that's the shift from top down to this upskill from within. And of course I just even started to do the second piece which was like, hey, look at the big companies who are doing this.

Andy Raskin (00:34:10):
And then I think they showed, "Hey, you're not doing this. Look, training is becoming very expensive. People don't care. So this is the downside. So we're creating these sort of stake ..." And also I think he has something about how training now, like companies, if you don't adapt, if you can't get these skills to your people, if you're a car company and you can't get these skills around electric cars, you're dead.

Andy Raskin (00:34:35):
Nick was in France and he saw this poster, a recruiting poster from McDonald's and it said, "Hey, if you work at McDonald's you're going to learn from everybody else on your team." And it was like, wow, there it is. So there's another example we used as a kind of winner example. And so then the question became, I can't remember exactly, it was something like, how do you upskill from within? What would it take for you to turn your experts into champions of learning in the company and turn them into stars, and all this?

Andy Raskin (00:35:06):
And then I'm going to forget here what all the obstacles were. But I think it was things like, well, how are you going to make it possible for anybody to create a course? People who might have expertise in electric engines but don't know how to create a course, how are you going to make sure that there's still the learning department, they're going to keep control and can ... all this. You can imagine all the different kind of questions. And then of course now 360Learning starts talking about all that stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:35:36):
What Nick has told me, I'm actually going to be on a webinar with Nick where someone asked me, "Could you bring in a CEO who could talk about this stuff? Not just you B blabbing on about strategic narrative." And so Nick is going to join it. And we had a dress rehearsal the other day and he was telling me it's just like when he starts with this now he doesn't even get the question anymore of well how are you different from this other learning platform? Which used to always be the thing. It's just a much more seamless, okay, yeah, talk to our learning people, get this going. So it's just sounds like it's been really effective for them.

Lenny (00:36:13):
That's actually was what I was going to ask next is what kind of impact have you seen with someone shifting their pitch story from this doc? What was the arrogant doctor approach to the strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:36:23):
Yeah, I mean it's always this kind of thing I hear. I mean, of course it's very difficult to measure this. I mean, what was the value of the strategic narrative for Gong and its growth? Was it 3X versus 1X, 2X? Or I don't, who knows, right? But the things I hear from CEOs, a few things. One is that when they're pitching, they're not pitching features out of context, they're pitching now a movement which is a lot better place to be, I think. In a way you're not pitching product. Product is like a prop for making the story come true. Very important prop, but there's this higher level overlay that becomes the focus of the conversation, at first, and of course we're going to get into product and that helps sell. Once we have this story then everything in marketing can be all about this story.

Andy Raskin (00:37:21):
With Zuora, if you look at their website, well when they first started doing this, maybe 80% of the content is not, "Hey, let me tell you about how Zuora is so great," or, "Here's our new release," or whatever. It's, "Here's how music companies are embracing subscriptions. Here's how luxury goods companies are embracing subscriptions." It's all these kind of almost trend pieces that become unlimited fodder. And again, you're not touting your ... it's less salesy, right?

Andy Raskin (00:37:51):
Another thing I just hear always, I just interviewed a CEO this morning for my podcast and this is the first thing he actually said was, "It becomes the strategic north star for the product." So what he was telling me, and this was actually a little unusual, I asked him, "Why did you come to me at first?" And of course I'd asked him that before, but he said something this time that was a little different from what I'd heard before. He said, "We are constantly getting feature requests through sales, through customer success. And we had sort of no way, bar to decide well what do we take on, what don't we take on? And this clearly has become our bar."

Andy Raskin (00:38:38):
If you think about it for 360Learning, does it help us upskill from within? It's in. Does it not? Or it's prioritized. Does it not? Less prioritized. Amit Bendov told me this directly, he said we exactly the same thing. He said, "We get a lot of requests for features and a lot of them are basically about opinions, some way to record opinions."

Lenny (00:39:04):
And this is Gong.

Andy Raskin (00:39:04):
"We're not going to do those." In Gong, yeah. "We're not going to do those."

Lenny (00:39:08):
Are there any companies out there that maybe aren't clients that you see as like, wow, these guys are nailing it and they're doing a great job of this strategic narrative?

Andy Raskin (00:39:15):
Well, one that really comes to mind is, I mean it's been out there for a while, but Drift. Drift comes out with essentially like a chatbot for your website, which might be the 30th chatbot for your website. And they don't say, "Hey, here's why our chatbot is the best one." They start from a completely different place, which is, "Hey, used to be people would sort of wait around for you to get back to them. It was a world of later. They called it the world of forms. You put up a web form and you expect someone's going to fill it out and maybe wait a few days while you take your sweet time deciding if you're going to get back to them."

Andy Raskin (00:39:58):
And David Cancel and David Gerhardt started from right the beginning saying, "Now we're in a world of now, where buyers are ..." I think they showed this woman, I remember it was this woman sleeping with her phone. That's your prospect. They're always on and they're going to expect you to be engaging with them right away. And they called this conversational marketing, and they really went with that and created I think a whole movement and they broke away from all of the other chatbots.

Lenny (00:40:35):
Awesome example. So earlier you threw out this word category, and I've noticed you haven't talked about category and category creation too much, and I think that you're kind of not a fan of this idea of creating a category and focusing on category. I'd love to hear your perspective on how that all relates to the stuff you recommend.

Andy Raskin (00:40:55):
Lenny, are you trying to get me in trouble? Like that guy who guy on your podcast who attacked jobs to be done?

Lenny (00:41:02):
Apparently, let's do it. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into.

Andy Raskin (00:41:06):
I would soften it a little bit and not just ... because I don't want the ire of the category design folks, but I really would soften and say, I wouldn't say I'm not a fan of creating category. Look, I think if you look at Play Bigger, which has become The Bible of that category creation thing, if you look behind that going to, what do they say the category is? They say it's a narrative. It's a story about how the world was to how it is. And so what I find though is that when people think about category creation, they tend to just focus on, okay, well, what is this category name going to be that we got? What are these three words or two words, whatever, that are going to magically make us seem like we're totally different from everybody else?

Andy Raskin (00:41:52):
And A, I think that's not really possible. These three words aren't going to do it. Take Gong, I mean already other companies were using this term revenue intelligence. With Gong, it suddenly becomes a thing because I think they have this opinions-to-reality story behind it. At one point, again, I asked Amit, he said, "Yeah," because I remember he really struggled, "What should we call it? What should we call it?"

Andy Raskin (00:42:20):
He came up with that one. But then when I asked him later, he is like, "Yeah, you know what? In hindsight we probably could have called it strawberry intelligence. It didn't matter. It was really the story that sort of mattered." I think he was exaggerating a little bit. And I think the category people would actually agree with this, I think they would agree with, hey, these three words are, it's sort of a shorthand for this movement of old game narrative.

Andy Raskin (00:42:48):
But I guess I feel like still by calling it category and category name, we're just focusing on those three words so much. And what happens often is CEOs will, they'll kind of come up with this little category, like what happened with Nick at the 360Learning with collaborative learning. We have this name, but we don't know how to tell the story around it. So my feeling is like, well, let's focus on the story. So that's why I talk about strategic narrative and movement creation versus category creation. If someone decides that your movement is a category, great. Bonus.

Lenny (00:43:32):
I see. So essentially your approach is category can play a part of this, but there's a bigger question you have of what's the story, what's the movement, what are the obstacles and categories and element of that potentially?

Andy Raskin (00:43:45):
I mean, I almost see them as orthogonal, like with HubSpot. HubSpot had this narrative around inbound. It used to be just outbound stuff, now we're going to have inbound. And that wasn't really a category. Back then they were probably known as marketing automation. Now they're probably known as CRM because they've broadened. But this movement is the thing that's sort of the constant and in some ways orthogonal to whatever category they're in.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Is the strategic narrative framework right for essentially any company or is there a sweet spot? And I've noticed most of the companies you've been talking about are B2B SaaS. So I don't know, maybe if there's a spectrum of perfect fit for strategic narrative framework and then not a fit at all. What's along that spectrum?

Andy Raskin (00:44:33):
Yeah, well you can see, I mean it takes a little time to tell this story and you were kind of framing it a little bit and we're telling it in lots of different channels. So I think it does really play well in this enterprise sales context because also we have a group buyer there. So it's not just one person who's doing some research. This whole group has to have a uniting story. So I think you're right that in noticing that the companies that this tends to resonate with tend to be B2B, enterprise sales, technology I think because often the product is very complicated. That arrogant doctor stuff comes from an age when the things people were selling were products on shelves that didn't change much, cans of soup at the supermarket or a car in a dealership. Even software back then, shrink-wrapped in a box, doesn't change.

Andy Raskin (00:45:44):
B2B software, this stuff is changing by the minute. And does it even make sense to make a claim to say, "Oh, we have these features and they have those features, therefore we're better," does that make any sense? That said, hey, I was looking for a sports watch, a Fitbit and I'm comparing specs and I'm doing all that stuff. And so that mode of buying is still happening, but I think, so yeah, when consumer products companies contact me, I usually say, "No." Occasionally they still say, "Okay, yeah, we'll build this, we still want to have this narrative." But yeah, I think it has the most value, most impactful right away for B2B enterprise technology companies.

Lenny (00:46:33):
Just a few more questions. One is just what's a sign that you should spend time in this area, that something is broken in your strategic narrative story pitch?

Andy Raskin (00:46:42):
Well, I can tell you what I hear from CEOs when they contact me. I always ask, what's happening? Because that idea I had, no CEO's going to budget a line item for this. I'm basically asking, why was I wrong? So a few things they tell me, one is that the company is maturing from a point a stage where they've been successful, but that success is ... one CEO put it this way, was brute force of the founders. So the founders are in every meeting, they're in every product discussion, every sales call, and that's shifting, the company's getting bigger.

Andy Raskin (00:47:21):
Usually I'm seeing this around series B where the company is getting ... so they can't be in every sales call, every market call and they're looking to transmit all the good stuff and some direction in a way that people are going to remember and all that. Everything from how we pitch to what the product should be and all that, and they see this as that.

Andy Raskin (00:47:47):
There's another point that I see people contacting me at, which is where they're growing. It's usually a bit later where they've scaled tremendously successfully. Now we're either acquiring or building out whole new product units. And that old story we told is just, it's just not big enough and we got to expand it to something bigger. This is the example of OneTrust, which the CEO I had on my podcast recently. Starts out with just, I think it's data privacy around the regulations that people have to be able to say, "Don't track me," things like that. And then they buy these other company and now we have this much bigger offering. So how do we tell the story? And then I guess the third one is some form of pivot where hey, we were telling an old story but whatever, the market changed or whatever and we want to go in a different direction.

Lenny (00:48:53):
Say a founders listening to this and they're like, "Okay, I realize I need to do this. I haven't spent enough time on this. Something's not working. This could be a huge unlock for us." What are the first couple steps they could take to start to figure this out? And I imagine at some point it's like, go talk to Andy. He'll help you through this. Is there stuff you can do on your own? How do you go about figuring this out?

Andy Raskin (00:49:11):
Well, a lot of folks have emailed me over the years like, well I told you before, there were some who emailed me like, "Hey, tried it, didn't work." But many more have emailed me, "Hey, I tried it, it did work. Thank you." And so yeah, just try to lay out that structure and try it mean even when I work with teams, I adapt what people might call sort of lean approach. I want to get that thing out there into sales calls. We're not rolling it out to the whole sales team right away, but getting it out into some sales calls and get a sense, "Hey, is this resonating? Are people given the nods?"

Andy Raskin (00:49:49):
Ideally by the way, one way I look to test it, is it working, is when we talk about this shift and the stakes and do they stick. Do they kind of say, "Yeah, let me tell you how that's playing out for us,"? Or, "Am I? Yes, I'm seeing that." Sometimes I'll literally, I'll train salespeople to ask them that question, like, "Am I crazy or are you seeing this?" And what do they say? And you can usually tell if they're in and it's qualitative. But I really like that kind of testing to see if it's working. And I think anybody can do that.

Lenny (00:50:32):
Is there a template or guide you have online for folks to follow other than maybe just listening to this podcast and reading? Is there a post that's like, "Here's the framework defined, and go follow these steps,"?

Andy Raskin (00:50:41):
I mean, I guess the closest is that The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen post, which is the Zuora deck. But even there, people have asked me for a framework and presentation companies say, "Can we have your template so we could make it available to people? We'll revenue share with you or something." And I am so against this template. Every team I work with, it's different. It's not the same number of slides. Sometimes we can lay out this shift in one slide, sometimes it just feels better or the team likes it better, whatever, if it's a few and we're sort of getting people into it. Sometimes there's no slides. So I am really hesitant to recommend any template. And what I'd say is these are principles for building it, not any prescribed formula.

Lenny (00:51:37):
If they do want to reach out to you while we're on this topic, what's the best way to contact you?

Andy Raskin (00:51:42):
Connect with me on LinkedIn. That's usually a good one. And I'm usually posting things on LinkedIn that I've learned from working with other teams.

Lenny (00:51:52):
Awesome. Last question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Speaking of LinkedIn, you posted how in a working session with companies that the second session is always this low point they all go through and that everyone's starting to get discouraged and pained. And first of all, I love the expectation setting. You're like, "This is going to suck initially and it'll get better." Why is that the low point and what is it that they focus on in that second session?

Andy Raskin (00:52:17):
Well, apparently I'm not doing enough of an expectation setting, because what that post was about was this woman. So when I work with a CEO I always ask them to create what I call a strategic narrative team of up to four people. And usually those are leads of marketing, sales, whatever. In this case, the CFO was a really important person in this company. And so the CEO wanted her as part of this team. And she said to me at the end, she's like, "I love where we got to." I always ask, "What worked? What didn't work?" And she's like, "I love where we got to. That worked great. What didn't work was like, you told us that this second session was going to be bad, but I think you could have drilled home more like exactly how bad."

Andy Raskin (00:52:58):
And then I asked her, "Actually, could I have that quote with your face on a slide that I now present to future teams?" She said, "Yeah, you could do that." So the way I work it is I have a kickoff session where essentially I'm asking people on the team, what are these pieces? What is this old game, new game shift? How do we talk about when to set the stakes and everything I just took you through? And we have like five people in the room. There's going to be ... we're going to come out of this with notes and notes, boards and boards of ideas of this stuff.

Andy Raskin (00:53:34):
And so then two things happen. One is I ask the team to start interviewing customers about how they see this shift and sometimes the customers will literally give us the words and that can be helpful in sort of aligning if we have differences. But I also start working with the CEO one-on-one and we build a first version of this thing, and it's the second session where we present this first version to the team and think about what's happening.

Andy Raskin (00:54:02):
The team has just given us millions of gold ideas, truly they're all ... and in order to make something sort of clean and powerful, the CO and I have had to pretty much throw out all of them, save one or two. And there's going to be feelings about that, first of all. Second of all, if this were easy to just get all ... interview everybody, come up with it, they would've done it. So it's going to be wrong.

Andy Raskin (00:54:30):
But the good news is this is where the team gets to weigh in. I also ask, what's working, not working in this thing? And when we learn how it's not working, that gives us the juice to then me and the CEO go back to the drawing board. We plan on this in advance, we're going to go back to the drawing board and then bring up something good. So having a shit draft is a million times more valuable than having all these great ideas. But it's also really painful. It's painful not only for them, but for me. No matter how many times I say this, I expect they're going to love it in that first one too. And I'm really pissed off when they don't. But luckily now I've done enough times I know that's going to happen.

Lenny (00:55:20):
I was just watching a documentary about Annie Lamont who came up with the first draft concept for writers that I stick to.

Andy Raskin (00:55:27):
I'm a firm believer in that. Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:30):
As you're talking, one last thought that I had is, so you'd work with because and founders. I feel like this could be just as useful to product leaders, product managers working on a product that they're launching, just like what is the movement, where it's happening, here's why this product's important. Do you find that too?

Andy Raskin (00:55:45):
Absolutely. And very frequently, the product leader, chief product officer is part of this group. What I'd say though is that the reason ... so after I did this work for a few years, I looked back and I was like, which were the engagements I did where I can see it, and the narrative is really this true north star for everything?

Andy Raskin (00:56:10):
It was always the ones where the CEO was leading it, not just in name, but literally the person who called me who was working on the drafts with me and going through. And so initially I didn't insist that it would be the CEO doing that, but eventually I started to, and I think even for a product leader, you're going to want the support. You don't want to be just telling that story in product. You're going to want that supported from this Zuora person who gave me the initial deck, he said it, "It was like I had air cover and I was just going down and knocking down deals on the ground." You're going to want that air cover in marketing, sales, recruiting, everything. And how much better is it if it's really driven by the CEO and you have that?

Lenny (00:57:01):
Amazing. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on or you want to share before we get to our very exciting lighting round?

Andy Raskin (00:57:07):
No, except I love category design people and it's really just sort of terms that I like that are ... you know what? Forget it. Scratch that part.

Lenny (00:57:19):
I thought that was funny.

Andy Raskin (00:57:21):
Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, we could leave it in. We could leave it in. You could even leave this in where I'm telling you to scratch it.

Lenny (00:57:26):
Sounds good. I was actually going to joke that I was going to cut this out and leave you hanging, but okay.

Andy Raskin (00:57:31):
No, you can do that. Yeah. Category design people. Love you. Don't hate me. Thank you.

Lenny (00:57:37):
Great. I love it. We're going to be okay, I think. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Andy Raskin (00:57:46):
I'm ready. I saw like what you sent them, but I didn't really look at them, so I'm just going to tell you what I said. I'll go off that.

Lenny (00:57:52):
Perfect. Excellent. The best version of this. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Andy Raskin (00:57:59):
One of the books that I read initially from that Barnes & Noble, it was Story by Robert McKee. I think a lot of people know about it who are sort of interested in story stuff, but it's kind of a Bible of people who are doing screenwriting and stuff. If anyone who's in Hollywood who thought about going to Hollywood, they know about this book. I love a book called Out of Sheer Rage. It's really not about what I do or anything, but the author is Geoff Dyer. Geoff, he's written a lot of books that are kind of essay memoir, and this is a book about him trying to write a book about DH Lawrence. So it's all about procrastinating and like, "Oh, I'm supposed to write this book. I'm about to go on a trip somewhere. Should I bring the collected works of DH Lawrence with me on the trip because that'll help me start the book, but maybe I shouldn't because it's not going to ... Then I could come back refreshed without having ..." Basically, it's all that. It's this sort of in the head. I just really enjoy that book.

Lenny (00:58:59):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Andy Raskin (00:59:03):
Station 11. Station 11. That was just so beautiful to me.

Lenny (00:59:09):
Trippy. That was a trippy movie. Did not expect to go where it went. I usually ask what's a favorite interview question you like to ask, and I don't know how often you're interviewing people, but does anything come to mind when I ask that?

Andy Raskin (00:59:21):
Well, I can tell you one thing I ask when I speak with CEOs is I like to ask, what role has this narrative played in your leadership? How does it work in your leadership? And it's always really interesting for me to hear that, 'cause I often hear things that I don't expect.

Lenny (00:59:39):
What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you just really like?

Andy Raskin (00:59:43):
I recently got a Fitbit. I think I may have mentioned it earlier. I was looking for a product like that, and so far I'm really loving it.

Lenny (00:59:53):
Amazing. Have you tried other versions of Fitbits or that's the one that's working?

Andy Raskin (00:59:58):
I also ordered a Polar at the same time and wound up returning the Polar. Basically, it was just a little clunkier on my wrist, so I went with a Fitbit. Well, do you have one that you recommend instead?

Lenny (01:00:13):
I just have the Apple Watch and I've never tried a Fitbit and it gives me all this stuff that seems cool, but I've never gone further.

Andy Raskin (01:00:21):
I got the Fitbit like a week ago and I actually still am on the fence whether I bring it back to return it for the Apple Watch, so I'm enjoying it, but we'll see.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Okay. Final question. You're expert on presentations and I imagine you spend a lot of time in decks, and so just what's like one small change people can make to how they put together a deck or a presentation that will make their presentation a lot better?

Andy Raskin (01:00:41):
This is the one thing, make the title the takeaway of the slide so that the person looking at it has to do zero work to take away. So example, you'll sometimes see, "The problem," or, "The team." Replace, "The team," with, "Our team is veterans of whatever industry," or every single slide it's a takeaway, not a label. It'll make everything flow a lot better.

Lenny (01:01:17):
You did a killer job answering the lightning round questions without having a peek at what they were going to be. Andy, this was incredibly insightful. I'm going to go start working on my strategic narrative for my podcast and newsletter. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe consider working with you? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:01:35):
So I mentioned LinkedIn as a way to connect with me. That's fine. My website is AndyRaskin.com. I also have a podcast where I talk with CEOs, so if you're interested in hearing more details about actual use of this, it's called The Bigger Narrative. My mom introduces every episode. I sent her the interviews in advance. I call her and interview about what she thinks people will get out of it, and that conversation becomes the intro to the podcast episode. And what was the last question?

Lenny (01:02:04):
How can listeners be useful to you?

Andy Raskin (01:02:06):
Useful to me. Just if you try any of this stuff, let me know. Like, "Hey, worked. Didn't work. Have this question." I would love to hear that stuff.

Lenny (01:02:17):
Amazing. Andy, thank you again for being here.

Andy Raskin (01:02:20):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. This is really fun.

## Transcript

Anneka Gupta (00:00:00):
When people say, "I want someone that's strategic," what they're really saying is, "I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product." So that's number one. And the second piece is, "I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on." And I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Today my guest is Anneka Gupta. Anneka is Chief Product Officer at Rubrik, a lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and on the board of Tinuiti. Previously, she was President, GM, and head of product at LiveRamp, where she spent 11 years and joined as one of their earliest employees. A bunch of former guests recommended Anneka Come on this podcast and you'll soon see why.

(00:01:03):
In our conversation, Anneka shares a ton of powerful advice on navigating difficult personalities, giving and hearing hard feedback, bringing humor and gratitude to every situation, managing your energy versus managing your time. Super tactical tips for how to become more strategic and how to make better decisions, and also how to break into product management for people that are trying to become product managers. There's something in this episode for everyone and I am excited for you to learn from Anneka. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Anneka Gupta. Anneka, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Anneka Gupta (00:01:51):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:52):
So, I want to start with a question that I've started to ask guests that come on the podcast that have had extraordinarily successful careers and also just consistently successful careers. So here's the question. What do you believe are one or two skills or mindsets or habits that you think most contributed to your success that you think might be helpful for other people to learn and build to help them have more successful careers?

Anneka Gupta (00:02:18):
So it's funny, before we kicked this off, you talked about the post-it that you have on your computer that says have fun. My one mindset that I really have leaned into after someone actually gave me advice on this is to figure out how to have fun in my job, even in the most difficult of times. The reason why I say that is because when you're hit with really hard times, it's easy to operate from a mindset of scarcity and to look at everything as an unachievable hurdle to overcome. And when I was able to switch my mindset and say, "Well, I'm actually going to figure out a way to have fun with this," it actually changed my entire for how to deal with super difficult situations.

(00:03:03):
This advice specifically came up to me when I had a scenario where I had to essentially change out all of my direct reports in very short order, and I figured that out. It was a super daunting situation. I didn't know how I was going to manage and at first I felt so scared by what was ahead of me and how much change I was going to have to go through in a very short period of time. But when I got this advice, I started to try to reframe my thinking and it actually really made it so that I was able to get through that hard time and opened my mind up to so many more opportunities. So, now I try to embody that in every situation that I come across where I'm faced with something super, super challenging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:45):
I love this advice. It's something that I've recently seen also in public speaking. If you can just reframe your thinking from "I'm scared of this" to "This is going to be fun. I'm going to have so much fun doing this. It's going to be like this energy and anxiety I'm feeling is me feeling like it's going to be a lot of fun." So, spending a little more time here, how do you actually do this? So in this case, you shared an example of basically you have to fire a bunch of people, not something one can quickly think about how to have fun with that. How did you do this? Is it just in your mind you're like, "I'm going to have fun with this," or is there something tactically people can do to make something fun?

Anneka Gupta (00:04:18):
I think there were a couple of things that I did and I've continued to do. One is figure out and really look at the situation and ask myself, what can I learn from this situation? What can I get out of this that's a positive outcome even though it is incredibly challenging to be facing it right now? So that's one thing that I've done. The second thing I think that has been really helpful is in going into meetings or other situations where I was trying to figure out how to collectively solve some big challenge, figuring out how to bring humor into the meeting. Just starting it on a light note and that elevated my own mood and way I was approaching the meeting, but also adds a level of levity to the situation for other people as well, which I think as a leader is super important because it's not just about your own mindset, but how are you transferring that mindset to the people that you're working with and the people that are working for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:12):
Got it. So part of it is just like, "How do I add a little humor?" Part of it is just thinking, "How do I make this fun?" Is part of this just like this is not as important as people make it out to be and we could just have a little fun with this thing. It doesn't have to be like we're not curing cancer.

Anneka Gupta (00:05:28):
Yeah, definitely I think that helps. Reflecting on this too, I feel like a lot of it comes down to the amount of emotional and mental energy I can bring to solving a problem. And there's always so much going on in life, like personal life as well as professional life, trying to figure out how can I architect my day and time to maximize my energy and be able to bring my full self to work and to these difficult so that I can have that mindset to look at things more broadly versus operating from a place of scarcity. That may come down to simple things like making sure that I have lunch. Sometimes when things get so busy you're like, "Oh, I'm just going to grab a protein bar and I'm going to skip lunch." But I found that that really decreases my energy.

(00:06:15):
Or, trying to do things that are really difficult late in the day. Five to 6:00 PM is my worst time of day and I know that about myself, so I'm not going to schedule in my most difficult meeting or writing up a strategy deck or something for that period of time because I know that that's not going to be my best and it's actually going to make it more difficult for me to get the work done. Being able to manage my energy levels and figuring out how to schedule my time for my energy has really allowed me also to figure out how to have that abundant mindset in all situations.

Today's episode is brought to you by Command AI. If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites where you ask a question and it says something like, "Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product.

(00:08:19):
The AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. Command AI works with web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, LaunchDarkly, and over 25 million end-users interact with Command AI interfaces. To try out Command AI, you can sign up at command.ai/Lenny and experience a custom demo of how it works in your app. That's command.ai/Lenny.

(00:09:06):
I'm going to go in a totally different direction. Before we were recording, we were also chatting about founder mode, and this is recently. This episode we're recording shortly after Paul Graham put out his now classic, instant classic founder mode post. And he had some really interesting takes on ways to think about founder mode, both from product leader perspective, from a founder perspective. So, there's kind of two questions I want to ask, but just broadly, what's your take on founder mode?

Anneka Gupta (00:09:33):
Well, first of all, I think Paul Graham did an amazing thing by putting a name to something so many of us have seen in practice. And while he didn't in his article say this is exactly what this is, I think many, many people that I talked to were like, "Oh yeah, I recognize this." I recognize people that I've worked for, CEOs, that have done founder mode, great founders that have done founder mode poorly. And it opened up a level of discussion that I think is really valuable for everyone to be having, whether you're a founder or you're someone that works for a founder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:04):
Okay, so I'm going to ask two questions around this. One is from the perspective of working for a founder and founder mode, the other is being a product leader in founder mode. So, first of all, imagine you've worked with a few founders that operate in founder mode. As a CPO, as head of product, that's often a difficult place to be between the founder and the team that are building the thing. What have you learned about how to effectively work as a product leader with a founder in founder mode?

Anneka Gupta (00:10:30):
So, I think when a founder's in founder mode and if they're doing it well, what they're doing is really deeply understanding the business and then figuring out when to use their power as a founder to either tweak things and send something in a slightly different direction or fundamentally innovate and completely change directions or completely innovate in a totally new area. Now I think the way to use that effectively as a head of product is to recognize that they have that power to figure out how to use that power to get the things done that you know are best for the company. So, I always think about I have all the people around me. Whether they're people on my team, my peers, or my CEO, these are different resources I have to go get a initiative done or get work done in the company.

(00:11:23):
And as having a founder that can effectively operate in founder mode means that I can go and have a conversation with the CEO and say, "Hey, look, we have this huge opportunity and these are the things that aren't working, and I need your help to help figure out how we can move the needle more substantially in the direction that we need to go." And so activating that founder, that CEO to really be able to push the initiative that I think is best by making them an ally in doing so. I think one aspect. The second aspect is, which often happens, it's very difficult for many people and I've had this happen to me many times, is when a founder is like, "Well, I have this idea," and then you may or may not agree that that's the best direction to go in and how do you navigate that kind of situation?

(00:12:10):
So, one is actually taking a step back and objectively saying, "Well, why are they pushing this?" Maybe it's the wrong mechanism to go actually get done a strategy that's quite important for the company. So having a really deep understanding about why are they asking this, what are they ultimately trying to get at and what is the objective that they're trying to get at and is this the right way to get at it? If the answer is no to that, then you can go have a conversation. If you know what the objective is, you can go have a conversation with that founder and say, "Hey, look, I know this is what you're trying to do, but maybe instead of looking at option A here of how we go about tackling this, we should have explored these three other options instead." And that can help you and help navigate that conversation.

(00:12:53):
Now sometimes it's difficult to even get to that kind of understanding of the objective because someone might be just super set in their ways of, "Hey, I really want to go after this opportunity. It's my pet project." Then you have to decide as a head of product, do I really want to fight this or do I just give in on this, let it go? And also make sure that we get the stuff done that's most important to the company. You have to make that judgment call as a head of product and decide what is really going to make or break the company. What's the hill that I'm going to die on and is this something that I can shift or is this something that is not worth shifting? Of course it comes down to the personality. I've been very fortunate that I've actually had very few of those situations where the founder has been like, "Hey, I really want to go in this direction and I haven't agreed, at least with what we're trying to go after, regardless of the mechanism behind it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:47):
I really love the point you made, especially about how the founder could be this lever to get things done. When you identify something needs to change, the best way to change that is just have the founder go in there, tell everyone, "Hey, we're going to do this thing differently." It's such like a positive spin on how to leverage founder mode where a founder actually has a lot of power to change that other people in the company don't. Okay, so let's go from the other side. So, I was talking to Nikhyl Singhal who runs the Skip, which is a community you're part of about you. And he said that you're a leader who excels in founder mode, that you operate in founder mode a lot. And so as a product leader, what have you learned about just how to think in founder mode, operate in founder mode, leverage that approach to leading teams, leading product teams?

Anneka Gupta (00:14:32):
Yeah, I think it's often easy as a leader to say, "I'm not going to roll up my sleeves and get into the details of the business or ask a lot of detailed questions about the business because you want to empower people and make them successful." What I've found is that understanding the details of the business and asking questions and understanding to the utmost extent you can, what's working, what's not, what are the financial goals of the business? Are we on track to get there? How are we making decisions? Getting into that level of depth is super important, and then you can decide as a leader, what do you want to do with that information? So there's a lot of information that I collect about what's happening in the organization, the decisions that we're making that I don't do anything with at a point in time.

(00:15:20):
That's my choice to make, but I want the information because in understanding the depth and what is happening, I can decide where I actually think I need to go in deep and make either very significant course correction or a small course correction. Then the way that I think about how do I bring my team along for that so they don't feel like I'm coming in and stomping all over the work that they're doing or trying to re-adjudicate a decision, one, is how do I get in there early?

(00:15:51):
One of the tactics I use is I ask people to present their strategies for things that I think we may need to do a course correction on, and I have them come in and then I ask them questions and then I make suggestion. And I'm able to do that in a forum where it doesn't feel like I'm coming in and rewriting the entire strategy, but I'm giving them there an opportunity to present their best thinking and then trying to figure out how do I take that and make that better and make them feel like I'm making it better versus stomping all over and dismissing the work that they've done.

(00:16:23):
I pick a strategic set of areas. So I think about what is most important for the business? What's going to kill the business if we don't get right and what are the biggest opportunities for the business that we need to go after regardless of how difficult it is for us to actually execute on that? By doing that, then at least I have clarity in my mind and I can provide clarity to the team about what is most important and rally the troops around making that stuff happen if that is what is essentially right. And I'll have all the context because I've asked all the questions of why this is right for the business, why is this going to help us with increased margins or get better growth or get into a new persona if that's what we're trying to do as an overall organization.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):
So in that example, and I love this tactic, you have your team come in, you ask them, "Tell me what the strategy is for this thing that you're working on." What you've seen work is instead of like, "No, this is broken, this is wrong, this isn't going to work." Your approach is ask questions and hope that they see the flaws or gaps. Is that how-

Anneka Gupta (00:17:24):
Yeah, it's ask questions, but you can't always lead someone somewhere with asking questions. It's also sharing a hypothesis. So I might have a particular hypothesis about the business where I might see something like, "Well, I was talking to security leaders in our customer advisory board recently and I heard this piece of feedback and this is what it made me think about our strategy, what do you think about that?" And then let them say like, "Okay, yeah, actually I see this or maybe I have some follow up questions."

(00:17:54):
It actually opens a whole discussion where I'm still able to provide my perspective and point of view but not completely shut down the discussion. Because what I always worry about is a leader is I'm going to come in and say something, and because I'm one of the more senior people in the room, no one is going to say if they have a concern. And the reality is I'm not always right far from it, but I want to be able to seed an assumption and then have a discussion based on that and then figure out what the right outcome is about what we should do next based on that discussion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):
Speaking of strategy, you shared with me that at one point in your career you got this feedback that you just weren't strategic enough and that that comment led you to research and dig into what does it mean to be strategic, and also just to level up your strategic mindset and the way you think about strategy. What did you end up with recognizing as being strategic? What is that in your work and in your research? And then how did you actually get better at this work of being strategic?

Anneka Gupta (00:18:57):
I got this feedback once in a performance review and then I actually got it as well a few years ago when I was interviewing for head of product roles and I thought I had made a lot of progress on it, but when I reflected back, I think it actually all came back to the same themes. Which was I think when people say "I want someone that's strategic," what they're really saying is "I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product." So that's number one. The second piece is, "I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on."

(00:19:45):
And I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic. If you're really good at articulating the why, but you're only bringing small ideas to the table, then that's not strategic. If you're championing big ideas but you can't articulate the why behind them in a compelling and simple way, then you're not going to be seen as strategic either. So, that's the formula that I've come up with. This is what it means. And so I focused a lot on how do I make sure I do both of these things? How do I champion a few things that a really big ideas that are going to help change the direction of the company, and then how do I articulate that in a simple and compelling why?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:26):
That's such a cool simple way of thinking about this. Is there an example from your work that might illustrate some of this from a project you worked on or a product you built?

Anneka Gupta (00:20:35):
I can take some recent examples. We've been doing a lot of strategic planning for where do we want to be as a company over the next three years, and Rubrik operates in the cybersecurity space. It's a very fast moving landscape. There's a lot of places that we could go as a business, and one of the ways that I've exhibited this, and this is what I recommend to other people too, is sometimes it's really hard to come up with the compelling and simple why behind something and sometimes it's also really hard to come up with a really big idea out of thin air. So these things can be very challenging. The first step that I found as very useful, and I use this tactic every single day in meetings, is just summarization. So, bringing people together, lots of different voices into a room and hearing what they have to say and at various times in the conversation summarizing what people are saying and summarizing what that means in terms of the direction that we could go in.

(00:21:34):
And then that's a checkpoint of saying, "Okay, this is how I've synthesized what is happening. Is this correct or do we actually need to do another turn because we don't all agree with where we're landing here?" That summarization, even though I may not be adding a new idea into that, I found people actually view that as strategy. They view the effective summarization as strategy. So I think that's one element. Then what I've also found is that when I summarize what other people are saying and especially multiple different stakeholders, then I can think about offline and not in the context of right in the meeting, sometimes in the meeting too I guess, is how do I make this idea one click better? It's not about how do you do something radically, radically different, but taking ideas and then making it slightly better, slightly better.

(00:22:25):
When you think about that, especially from an outside-in perspective of what are the customer problems we're trying to solve and how are we going to take this to market, and don't worry about how difficult the technical implementation is going to be, then you start to get to these big ideas that can really be the change agent ideas. So, I've started doing this more and more and I think especially in the past three to six months, and I'm seeing a material difference in terms of the number of big ideas that we're going and pursuing overall as a company and also the quality of the strategic thinking that I can bring to the table, and it's been really exciting and rewarding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:02):
There's so much you're sharing that resonates with other podcast episodes. For example, this idea of just going one click better. I had Roger Martin on the podcast where this book, Playing to Win, which is one of the more popular strategy books, and he has this concept of betterment as a way to work on strategy. A lot of people go huge with a big strategy and vision, and his advice is just find the thing that is the biggest constraint and bottleneck to your business right now and just make it better and that's your next step. And then just keep doing that and you'll end up in a much better place over time, even though it feels like you're just doing one little thing. And so I love this idea of just picking one thing and making it one click better. There's going to be an episode that comes out right before this with Alex Komoroske, and he has this concept of the adjacent possible and it's just find the next thing that's possible and focus on that versus some big lofty thing. So I'm just sharing a bunch of stuff, that's not a question.

Anneka Gupta (00:23:56):
That totally resonates though.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:58):
Okay, okay. Okay, great. And then the summarization idea, I love it. So tactical, basically any PM can do this just in a meeting just like, "Okay, let me just summarize to make sure everyone's on the same page." Funny enough, this is the feedback I get on this podcast and I haven't been doing this in our conversation yet, but I often try to summarize the person's point and everyone's like, "Oh, I love that you do that. That's so helpful." So I totally see the power of that in my experience.

Anneka Gupta (00:24:22):
It also makes people feel heard and especially when you have a lot of diverse voices in the room that may not agree on all things but have valid viewpoints, it helps bring people together and ultimately the diverse perspectives are going to yield better insights and better decisions for the organizations. You want that, but some people shy away from that because it's scary because you have to deal with a lot of conflict and it's a way to kind of move beyond the conflict and get to the heart of an issue, which in my mind, that's what the PM job is all about is getting to the very, very heart of a problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:56):
If someone wants to work on this skill of summarizing as kind of a tactic, can you give just an example of how you would do that? Is there like a phrase to use? Is there words or an example you could give of just like here's how it would look in a meeting?

Anneka Gupta (00:25:10):
Yeah. So, often if there's a lot of discussion going on, sometimes it can be a little hard to insert yourself. I still may insert myself and say, "Hey, let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said." This is what I've heard. I've heard that our customers are having these kinds of challenges. We feel like this is the way that we want to solve these challenges. We have a right to win in this way and therefore we're going to take this action.

(00:25:36):
Is everyone in agreement with that or is there some dissent about whether that's an accurate portrayal of where we've landed with this conversation? That's the way I'll frame it up and again, ending it on a question so that you're not coming in and just being like, "Hey, this is where we're at." But then inviting people to discuss and say "Yes," or "No, I agree with 90% of that or 10% off." And that helps move the conversation forward because sometimes you'll get stuck in these circular discussions that aren't moving forward and you need to figure out a way to move it forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
And then you experience is just doing that makes you look more strategic and gives people the impression you're thinking strategically?

Anneka Gupta (00:26:18):
Yes. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:19):
Awesome.

Anneka Gupta (00:26:19):
The other way you can do it is if you're in a room with someone and you have a whiteboard is actually summarize on the whiteboard while people are talking and then show your summarized framework or whatever on that. So that's kind of a good way to do it too. If you're having a hard time interrupting the flow of discussion or you don't feel as comfortable thinking on your feet and interrupting and then framing your point of view, you can do that. In Zoom you can also use a chat. I've done that very effectively and said, "I'm not going to interrupt the flow conversation. I'm just going to summarize in Zoom chat this is what I've heard, and this is what I think we're saying in this conversation." And then sometimes that'll get invited back into the broader conversation that's happening live on the Zoom itself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):
That's a much lower stakes way of doing it, and I'm picturing all the PMs listening to this, they're going to start doing this and there's going to be all these summaries now in Zoom chats and everyone will be like, "Oh my God, why is everyone sharing?"

Anneka Gupta (00:27:14):
And then Zoom AI will start just doing it all for you. Then we'll have to think again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):
And then PMs are over and AI replaced us all.

Anneka Gupta (00:27:19):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):
Okay, so then just to close the loop on becoming more strategic, your advice is when someone's like, "Hey, you're not strategic enough. You need to be more strategic." Your insights is the two things to work on is one, be clear on the whys behind the ideas that you're working on and be very crystal clear. People may not be understanding why you're working on the things you want to work on, the things you're pitching. And then two is actually be the person that makes these things happen, not just put a doc out there. If you're not actually achieving them, people are going to think you're not strategic.

Anneka Gupta (00:27:53):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:53):
Awesome. Okay. I want to talk about decision-making. You have a really interesting perspective on how to become a better decision-maker in relation to being kind of a historian, which I love this concept. Talk about that insight.

Anneka Gupta (00:28:07):
Yeah, so I was at my previous company for 11 years, so I kind of ended up becoming the historian. And when I joined Rubrik about three years ago, I came into an organization that had a lot of history that I just didn't know about. So one of the things that I decided to do when I joined the company was to really understand what happened in the past. What were the products that we launched that weren't successful? Why weren't they successful? What was the perspective on the history of how we've decided to develop the things that we did and why? What was the perception of different people in the organization? I tried to construct this past knowledge of what had happened and what were the decisions that were made and why were those decisions made, whether they were good or bad it didn't matter, so that I could better understand how to make decisions going forward and to learn from the mistakes that I didn't personally live through.

(00:29:07):
I think that's the part that's really important about being a historian. You can always be a historian. It doesn't have to be just when you join a company, but even today I'll hear about projects from many years ago that people will bring up and I'll be like, "Tell me about this project. What happened with it? How did we decide to do this?" And just really learn and be curious about it because that gives me more context into, well, what is it that we did poorly and how can we do that better? And also, what is the baggage that people have around trying to do something similar again? Because people always come with their baggage of, oh, this hasn't worked before, so why is it going to work now? And as a product leader, you're obviously putting in place a lot of thoughts and ideas around this is what I want to go achieve and these are the initiatives. And some people are going to come and say, "Well, we've tried that before." Especially you've been at an organization that's been around for a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:56):
I've been that guy. We've done this so many times. It didn't work. Why are we thinking about this again? Okay, so the advice is if you're new to a company especially, just study the past decisions that were made and share them out as a part of that and then as a side effect, it'll help you make better decisions because you'll have this history about what the company has done. I love that. Along the same lines of decision-making, I asked your former colleague Rachel Wolan what to ask you, and she said that your parting advice when she left to join a different company was it's not about making the right decision, it's about making the decision. That's like the things she remembered about you most, that parting advice. Talk about why that is so important and your insight there.

Anneka Gupta (00:30:42):
Very easy to get into analysis paralysis before making a decision and say, "Well, if I just had this one more data point, if I just knew this, then I could make a decision." But the reality is that you were always operating off of imprecise information as a product leader. What I've found is that once you commit to a decision, you actually learn more post committing to that decision about what's going to work and not going to work, and you move out of the hypothetical. And as long as your decision is like 70% right, you can iterate on that 20, 30% in either direction, but if you don't commit, then you don't actually get any new information that is high fidelity and high quality. So, I'm a big believer in making decisions...

(00:31:28):
I know you've had a few guests talk about speed is super important in organizations. Well, I think making decisions quickly and then being able to iterate on them is a form of that. Just make a decision. Don't make it uninformed, but have a strong hypothesis and then just keep testing whether that hypothesis is accurate or not and you'll shift here and there. You might build something that you have to throw away 20% of the work on, but that's okay. It's better than making no decision at all because you won't get any new information if you don't make any decision at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):
As a PM that might be listening to this, feeling like, "Okay, yeah, that sounds great." But then I make a bad decision and then Anneka is going to be like, "You messed up here. You've shipped the wrong thing here. It didn't work." How do you create a culture where people don't feel that and aren't as afraid of making bad decisions and making decisions with 70% of the information?

Anneka Gupta (00:32:19):
I think part of it comes down to making sure there's a strong hypothesis that everyone understands when you're making the decision. Or it might not just be one hypothesis, it might be a series of hypotheses and assumptions that we're making that are informing the decision. So it might be a hypothesis that this segment of customers is going to be willing to pay for this product because it's solving an urgent and important enough need for them that they're going to go do it and this is the evidence we have to find it, but this is also the stuff we don't know.

(00:32:52):
Then along the way, we learn whether that hypothesis is true or not. And so at the end of the day, if something didn't work out, we can go back to the original hypothesis and say, "Well, this is what we learned in this process that our hypothesis was actually not true, and we learned all of this after the fact." I think the way to make a culture of risk taking and people willing to make these bets and go out on a limb is to reward the learning versus the outcome. That's what I try to focus on is if we're constantly learning, it is okay if we make bad decisions, but we learn from them and we get better for next time. Even in making this bad decision, we learn something about our customers or our business that we otherwise wouldn't have learned that we can use in another context.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:40):
First of all, I love that this comes back to your strategic lesson of just if you have a strong why behind something, that's incredibly powerful and people will be confident that you're thinking strategically. Two, I was just at a talk with Zuck. He's being interviewed at the Chase Center, the Acquired Podcast at this whole event, and his main thing that he talked about that he values most in the culture of Facebook is learning faster than anyone else. Shipping stuff that isn't perfect, but just so that you can get one more turn and learn something faster than someone else. So, that super resonates that's Facebook's culture. Is there an example of something you worked on where you did that, where you kind of ship something that you weren't fully confident in and you learn faster?

Anneka Gupta (00:34:26):
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot because anytime you're shipping products, there's so many different things that could go right and wrong. There's a situation where we created a really amazing high value product and we decided not to monetize it, and then we realized after the fact, "Wait, we should have monetized it. So, we're trying to figure out how to package some new capabilities to monetize this thing that we know has a lot of value without taking away what we've already given to existing customers." So that was something we learned along the way that we originally didn't think, oh, we should monetize this, but then we realized that there's actually an avenue to do that after the fact. There's been other things where we've developed a set of capabilities thinking that it will solve for this new persona's problems, but then we misunderstood how easy it was going to be to go sell to that new persona within our own organization. I've made that mistake many times actually.

(00:35:26):
And so now I think now what I've taken from that is really know how you're going to sell something and who's going to do the selling before you actually go build out the product. Because if you don't have that right focus, you may build out the best product and yet it's going to get zero adoption because no one in your organization is ready to sell it. So there's tons of stuff like that where it's like been okay, yeah, we've learned something from this, and it's not all throwaway, it just means that we've got to do something differently for this product and we need to do something differently for our organization going forward.

I want to come back to something Rachel also shared with me when asked her what questions to ask you. By the way, first of all, she spent a lot of time raving about how amazing you are first. That was the first set of conversations, and then she came up with a bunch of questions to ask you. And so her other question was about how good you are at navigating very difficult personalities. She showed this quote that she constantly saw you interact with and bring together several leaders who had much higher egos and very disparate points of view who are not informed or thoughtful or as gracious as you were, and she also said you have very low ego. She wanted me just to ask you for what you've learned about how to navigate very difficult personalities and help people align when it's not neatly what they want to do.

Anneka Gupta (00:38:06):
I try to embody the mindset of feeling like and believing that I can work with anyone. I think what I do when I hit a difficult personality and difficult personalities come in all shapes and sizes and forms is I really try to understand what drives that person. What is it that they really care about? Hopefully they care about something deeply about the company and making the company successful. Sometimes they care about their own personal career, how they're showing up, what people view of them. That's fine. I just need to understand what it is that they really care about, and then if I need something from them, what is it that I can do to motivate them to find what I need from them important? And trying to make that match of they have this desire kind of like building a product, they have this desire and how am I going to get them to care about the thing that I want to care about?

(00:39:08):
The other thing I do is instead of feeling like anger or frustration with the person and instead trying to shift that to a mindset of feeling gratitude and a positive emotion about them is I look at them and I ask myself what can I learn? Maybe I don't want to adopt their personality or operate the way that they are operating, but everyone has something that they can teach you, whether it's their communication style or the way they're able to marshal people together, the way they come up with visionary ideas, whatever it may be, trying to study that person and be curious about them, learn from them and then thank them for that and feel the generosity genuinely about what I got from this situation. It's easier to do sometimes than others, but I think it comes back to that abundant mindset. If you can approach it with an abundant mindset, then you can really consciously do this and when you actually learn something, you will feel the gratitude when you recognize that you are able to get something from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):
I love that this connects with your other original piece of advice of just turning something into this is going to be fun. Let's make this fun. And in this case it's like make it great. What can I learn from this person even though they're really annoying me and it's frustrating and don't want anything done? Then your other point of understanding what they want and kind of using that as a way to pull them in your direction, how do you figure out what they want? Do you have any tricks for just like, "Here's how I learn what this person's motivations are and goals are"?

Anneka Gupta (00:40:42):
Talk to other people that have worked with them before and have done so successfully. So that might be people that work for them because if you work for a person like that, you have to figure out and or you're successful working for that person, you probably understand what makes them tick. So that's one, or talk to people that are peers, anything like that to try to understand and build this view of this person that helps me empathize with them and also helps me understand what they may be wanting to get out of a situation and why.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:16):
I love that. Yeah, they don't have to be involved in that. You just ask other people, "What is this person's motivations?" And then the idea is connect what they want with the thing you're trying to achieve. Beautiful. I really love this idea of when you're frustrated by someone just reframing it to like, "I'm grateful I'm going to learn something from this person in our interaction, even though they're making life hard for me." I really love that. Another skill I hear you're really strong at, and this comes from another one of your colleagues, Hema Mohan shared that you're world-class at giving feedback, giving hard feedback, and receiving hard feedback. And so I want to just ask you, what have you learned about how to do this? It's very hard to give hard feedback. That's why it's called hard feedback. So from either direction, what have you learned about receiving hard feedback or giving hard feedback where someone actually hears Zoom doesn't get defensive?

Anneka Gupta (00:42:07):
The answer is so much, I've learned so much from it. So maybe I'll start with receiving feedback. So, on the receiving feedback side, I think it's very natural to feel upset, defensive, all the negative emotions when you first see a piece of negative feedback, whether it's you're reading it in a employee survey or you're receiving it in a one-on-one from a direct report or from a manager or from a peer. And I try to let myself just feel the things that I'm going to feel. Sometimes that's an emotional feeling, sometimes that means I want to step out of the room or it depends on who I'm talking to, but let myself feel the things that I'm going to feel. Then once that's passed, whether that's a few hours or a few days, don't react. Don't try to say, "Oh, I don't believe this." Listen. And then ask myself, okay, well where is this feedback coming from? Why am I getting this feedback?

(00:43:07):
And try to be super curious about it. And that might be going back to the person that gave me the feedback and maybe asking someone that's a peer somewhere in the organization that might have more context and flavor to what the feedback really is, just trying to learn. Then I can decide, do I think this is valid or not? Is this something I should do something about or not? Actually, all feedback I think is valid. People's feelings are valid, but it doesn't mean that you need to do something about all of those things. Going through that process and letting myself ride the emotional wave and not judging myself for that, but then not reacting and letting myself then figure out and come back curious. I think when you come back curious, people then want to give you more feedback because they know that you're listening and that you're hearing what they say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:55):
So the advice is feel it, don't block it off and be like, "No, no, no, no, no, this isn't real." So fully let your body go through the roller coaster of feeling the negative feedback. Sometimes the feedback is just like, "No, this isn't actually a thing." Do you have any just heuristic of like I should actually pay attention to this deeply or just like let me wait for more data points?

Anneka Gupta (00:44:15):
Yeah, I think in product you receive feedback all the time for your organization or for yourself, and you can't make everyone happy. Everyone wants a different thing from product. So I think this comes up quite often where there's a lot of feedback for the organization or for you as a leader and you have to decide what to focus on and what not to focus on. I always try to anchor on, "Well, what is best for the company and what does the company need for me and for my team at this point in time?" There's stuff that is a must-have on that list, and there's stuff that's nice to have. Sometimes there's just too many must-haves to go deal with the nice-to-haves and you have to just be like, well, I know this is a problem, or I know we could be 10% better in this, but it actually doesn't matter as much as fixing these things that are really, really important and are really what's going to help my organization deliver what it needs to for the company and for the business overall.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:13):
In terms of receiving hard feedback, so you shared one example or I shared an example where someone said you weren't strategic enough. Is there another example of receiving hard feedback that you got that you're like, "Ugh, that sucks"? Either earlier in your career or more recently, anything else come to mind?

Anneka Gupta (00:45:26):
I mean all the time. So there's always hard stuff. Well, people will give feedback of, "Oh, I feel like we're not moving fast enough on our roadmap and priorities. We need to be doing more. Why aren't we moving fast?" Or-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:47):
Never heard that one before.

Anneka Gupta (00:45:48):
Never heard that one before, right? Or disparaging the direction that we're taking a certain product because they don't agree with it because a competitor is doing something else, but we've decided for our reasons that we're not going to go follow that path. There's always something that people have negative feedback about and sometimes I'm like, "Okay, this is an eye roll." I understand where they're coming from. I understand why they're giving me this feedback, but I also don't agree that we should change directions because of it. I don't know, some of the things cut deeper than others, but I think people are making personal statements about my team or they're feeling like, "Hey, the product team isn't listening to feedback, or the product team has a bad culture. Anneka isn't listening." Things like that cut deep and are a lot more... I know like physiologically they make me kind of seize up a little bit, but again, then I try to feel the things I'm going to feel and try to understand why are they saying that. Why do they really feel that and what does that mean behaviorally that I have to do differently or my team has to do differently or maybe just two people on my team need to do differently and someone is extrapolating this out to be a much bigger problem than actually is?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:59):
Awesome. Okay, and then we were going to shift to what you've learned about giving hard feedback so that someone actually listens and doesn't just put up a shield and like, "It's not real."

Anneka Gupta (00:47:10):
So I think in giving feedback, you can never fully control how someone else is going to respond to that feedback. All you can control is what you do, your body language and what you say. What I have found is that if I can convey, and I will say this very directly to people, I care so much about you and I'm giving you this feedback because I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to reach the pinnacle of what I know you can accomplish. And you do all of that setup and you don't just hope that they understand that, you actually explicitly say that and you show that in your body language, then it makes the other person much more receptive to hearing whatever you have to say. Then I think the other piece is that you've got to be direct.

(00:47:57):
The worst feedback is the kind of passive-aggressive feedback versus saying directly this is what you are doing or this is how you are being perceived in the organization, and here are the three things that you can do to change the way you're being perceived or to change the outcomes of what you're driving or become more strategic or whatever it is that I'm trying to give feedback on. I do a lot of prep before I give someone a lot of feedback. I really think about how can I frame this in a way that's going to resonate with them that doesn't come across as attacking them, but helps them understand why what they're doing isn't working or is being perceived poorly? And try to give them examples and even examples that I've personally had to go through myself of how I've approached those situations. And let them ask questions and brainstorm with them, be part of the solution versus saying like, "Here's all this feedback, now you go figure out what to do with it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
This reminds me of Radical Candor. Basically make people feel like you care deeply about them, but be very direct about what they can be doing better. Are there phrases or ways that you set up the conversation? You mentioned a few of just like, "I want to help you become the best version of who you could be and what you're capable of." Is there any phrases you find helpful that you come back to often of just a way to start the conversation?

Anneka Gupta (00:49:21):
Yeah, I think what I started with is like, "I care a lot about you. You have a lot of potential. I can see you doing these kinds of things. I can see you getting to where you want to go in your career." Sometimes I even start the conversation by asking them, "What do you want to do? Where do you want to go in your career?" And that will help me frame up which of these things are important. Because honestly, if someone wants to be eventually like a CPO, the feedback I'm going to give to them is very different than if they're like, "Hey, I don't really want to manage people ever. I just want to be the best I see I can ever be." I'm not going to give them the same feedback. And so having that conversation up front also allows them even before I jump into the feedback to give them their perspective of what they want and then I can tailor the conversation more to what they're looking for.

(00:50:04):
I think that has really helped as well make sure that I focus on the things that are going to really matter. During the feedback conversations, I also try to frame things as this is how you're being perceived than you are doing X. Because I think even though it's hard to hear, "Oh, hey, this person doesn't perceive you in the way that you may think," then we can talk about, "Well, what are ways that we can change the perception?" I also think it's important because sometimes people are like if you say, "Hey, I don't think you're X," and then they're like, "Well, yes I am." And if you're saying, "Hey, well this is how other people perceive you including me, but maybe this is not what you are intending," and you actually say that, you're giving them the benefit of the doubt of actually how they're trying to show up is different than how people are perceiving them. You can have a better conversation then around, "Well, what can you do to change that perception?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):
You mentioned I see product managers, and this is a good segue too. You're a big deal, fancy chief product officer person. A lot of people listening to this podcast are early career PMs or trying to get into product. I want to ask a couple of questions along these lines. One is about getting into products. So, interestingly, you got into product the same way I got into product, which is you used to be an engineer and then you moved into product within a company, which is maybe one of the simplest ways to get into product potentially. For people that are trying to break into product management, what advice do you often give them of how they could go about doing it? I know there's never the silver bullet, but what's your advice?

Anneka Gupta (00:51:41):
I definitely think doing it within the same company is a lot easier than trying to switch companies and switch jobs at the same time because when you're within a company, you've already built credibility, hopefully. And if you haven't, then go crush it at your job so you build the credibility. Then you can start to raise your hand, interact with the product team, take on projects and do things that allow you to get some experience and build a relationship with a leader on the product team who then may be willing to take a chance on you to put you into a product role even if you don't have the experience. Especially when you're within the same company, you bring other things to the table. Let's say you're working in customer support, well, you have a huge amount of knowledge about what are the big problems that people are calling up the support team or opening tickets on the support team for, and that is valuable knowledge for being a product manager.

(00:52:33):
You're coming from the sales side, you're coming with a knowledge of how to sell the product, what really resonates, how do you do the objection handling, and that can be a valuable perspective. If you come from the engineering side, but you understand how the product is built and you understand that technical nuances of that well, that can also be a valuable way to enter into the product team. That way, even though you don't have the direct product experience, you're still bringing something to the table where you are going to have to get trained on core product management, but you're not going to have to be totally trained on the business or the technology.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:06):
So is the advice basically get a job in any function, not necessarily any function, but join a company however you can essentially and then push to try to get into the product team in some form?

Anneka Gupta (00:53:19):
Yeah, I think join a product adjacent function, which honestly pretty much every function is product adjacent, because what function does product not engage with, but as closely product adjacent as possible, and then yeah, find your way into the product world from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):
Ideally there's something within the company, there's some program I imagine that does this sort of thing. Some companies have something structured, some are just kind of ad hoc. Is there anything there you're just like should you talk about this in your interview just like, "Hey, I would really love to become product manager someday." Do you have anything along those lines that would help me get into that or not? Or should you not talk?

Anneka Gupta (00:53:52):
Well, I think it depends. For instance, when I joined LiveRamp, which was my previous company as a software engineer, I actually did say in the interview process I want to become a product manager I think. At that point I was still early in my career, I didn't know for sure, but I said that. Now that was a 20-person startup, so it was worth saying it because they didn't really have a product team and I wanted to put it out there that that was something I was interested in growing into.

(00:54:17):
If you're joining a 5000-person company, you're hiring manager is probably not going to receive it well if you're like, "Hey, I'm interviewing for product marketing, but really what I want to do is go into product." So, it just kind of depends on the company and the stage. You have to play that wisely. But I think once you're in a company, then finding a way to make a relationship with the product leader, or if you're in a startup that is really small and they don't have product management, well then you have the opportunity to take on projects for sure that are product management related because no one is doing that work. Really taking initiative to do that so that you can find an inroad into product management.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:57):
Kind of along these lines, you have a really unique perspective on new PMs because you teach product management at Stanford. You've been doing that for a while. I just want to ask you work with a lot of people that are new to product, thinking about getting into product, then get into product. What do you find are the things that new PMs or people getting into product most misunderstand about the role of PM or are most surprised by when they become product managers?

Anneka Gupta (00:55:23):
When we interviewed students as we were designing the class about what they wanted to learn, what was most surprising to me was that students would say, "Well, can you teach me how to use Figma? Can you teach me the tools that product managers are going to have to use?" What was surprising me about that was I don't think it's the tools that you need to learn to be successful. I think what you need to learn to be successful is how to take very ambiguous situations and consistently drive more and more clarity over time. So, it was interesting to see this mismatch between what people said they wanted to learn and what I felt they actually needed to learn.

(00:56:03):
Now, having taught this class for a few years now, I think talking to students who have then left and become product managers, they've seen a lot of this in practice now and I think they understand that, but there is this mismatch of people who haven't been in product management saying they want to go and thinking that they need to learn some tools or process versus the mindset and the skills required to clarify ambiguity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):
Along those lines, I actually saw you somewhere in a talk or maybe something you wrote talk about how creating this class and creating the curriculum helped you crystallize your own thinking on product and helped you crystallize the mental models of becoming a product manager. Is there anything that you recall from that time of like here's something that's really helped me understand about this function and the skill as you were putting together the class?

Anneka Gupta (00:56:51):
Yeah, I know anytime you're teaching something, you have to figure out a way to synthesize it for another audience, and so many of us have learned product management just figuring it out on the job. I don't know if there's a particular framework that I would say came out of that, but what I found very interesting was seeing the questions that people asked in the class and then feeling like, "Oh, I understand how to answer this question. I can provide an example for it." That was super interesting to me because I didn't expect that coming out of the conversation. Yes, there's frameworks we developed to talk about ideation and product discovery and all of that, but I think those are fairly flexible frameworks.

(00:57:33):
What was most enlightening was being able to crystallize the answers to some of these questions, whether it was about how do you interact as a PM effectively with engineering or what happens if the data shows you that it doesn't matter which direction you pick, like there's merits to both ways. How do you actually go about making those decisions? It was very interesting being able to then have those conversations with students and bring in the real life examples. And I found in some situations that actually go back to my own team and share the same answer that I came up with in class, I was like, "Oh, this is actually a valuable thing to share with my team back at my company."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):
Reminds me of the recent chat I had with this guy Alex Komoroske, where he talked about how oftentimes talking with people helps them uncover new insights that he had in his head and then he writes them down as soon as he says something that's really clever in any way. He's like, "Okay, I'm going to remember that now." Coming back to how to become a PM, so you see all these people getting and taking this class want to become product managers. I know they're like Stanford students and people more likely hire Stanford people. But I guess in terms of how they end up becoming PMs, if you were to look at the pie chart of the people that end up getting a PM job, what's the biggest chunk? Is it they join at some other function and then move into product? Do they just join as a junior PM somewhere? How are people actually getting into the PM role in that class?

Anneka Gupta (00:59:00):
Yeah, I think very few are directly going to an established company and becoming a PM directly, so I would say a big chunk of them. Some of them are, but many of those then had PM experience to begin with or had engineering experience and then went to a technical company into a PM role. The vast majority of them are joining product adjacent roles or they're going to small startups where they might be doing product management, might be the first product manager, or they might be doing product management plus plus, chief of staff, something like that where they get to put their hands in product management, but it's a super small company. So I think those have been the two most successful paths to get into product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):
Awesome. That's a really interesting lens into how people actually get into this role. Potentially final question, but we'll see where it goes. I have this recurring segment on this podcast called AI Corner where I try to get a sense of just how people are finding AI tools useful in their work, in their life. So, let me just ask you, is there anything you've found useful in some AI tool in how you work? Like something you found that helps you work more productively, more efficiently, either you or people on your team?

Anneka Gupta (01:00:08):
One way that we're using AI today is summarizing our user research calls. So, that has been really valuable because we're doing all these calls all the time, we're getting a ton of rich insights. Some of those rich insights are related to the specific project that we were doing this call for and some of them aren't. And now we have that summarized and tagged in a way where you can look up any sort of thing that you want around the calls that we've done and it'll find you the call, it'll find you the context, it'll find you the transcript and summarize exactly what we've learned from that call. So we're starting to use that more and more. It's very powerful capability. I definitely think that that kind of summarization of information for PMs is a big unlock for organizations and I think we're still in the very, very early days of AI making a meaningful difference to the way that PMs do their work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:01):
Is there a specific tool that you love to help you with that that you may want to give a shout-out to or is it something you guys built?

Anneka Gupta (01:01:07):
Yeah, we use Dovetail and it's been fantastic. Connects into all of the Zoom calls and everything, it does a great job with summarization, with search, everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):
Awesome. I love it when someone recommends a very awesome sponsor of the podcast. Dovetail is ongoing and excellent sponsor, so I'm really happy to hear that. Amazing. Anneka, is there anything else that you thought you wanted to share or that you want to leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Anneka Gupta (01:01:38):
The mindset that you bring to your work is actually the most important thing over anything else that you can do. And if you are approaching every situation as much as possible with the positive mindset, you can do more than you could ever possibly hope to achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:56):
I'm going to pull on this thread because this is such a powerful point and I think it's easy to just hear that. It's hard to learn to do it. Do you have any advice on just how to build that mindset? Like it connects to many of the things you said: how can this be fun? How can I be grateful to this person that's annoying me and the things that they might teach me? Is there just anything you've done that has helped you build this mindset?

Anneka Gupta (01:02:20):
Journaling is very powerful. So actually growing up I journaled every single day of my life from when I was 13 to when I was 23. And while I cringe to go back to read any of those, I think what it helped me do and build a practice around that I still do today is when I have a lot of thoughts going through my head, especially negative thoughts, just putting them all down on a piece of paper, writing them on my phone and trying to explore why am I feeling this way? Why am I getting triggered? What is it about the situation that's making me feel so strongly?

(01:02:56):
And when I put it down on paper, then it takes this thing that's abstract and things that I'm ruminating on and actually makes it possible for me to break it down and understand, "Well, okay, this is something I may feel, but the why behind it is a little irrational, so let me let this go." I realize that this isn't rational way to think about this. Whereas other things I start to uncover, well, what is it about the situation and what is it that I need to do differently? What's within my control and what is it maybe that I need to go talk to someone about and say, "Hey, I need you to do this differently to be able to make myself feel better and make the situation better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:34):
It's interesting this is another thread that's been coming up a bunch on the podcast recently that when something is bothering you or something is hard, the more you actually listen to that part of yourself and dive into it and explore it and give it a space to share and talk, the less power it gets and the more space is created for the stuff you actually want to take space. It's not what you would expect because usually it's like, "No, shut up, everything's fine." But the more you actually hear that out, the easier things get. So, I love that you share that.

Anneka Gupta (01:04:09):
It's like doing cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself. That's how I think of it. I've never actually done cognitive behavioral therapy, but I've read a lot about it and sometimes when I go through this, I'm asking myself the same questions that I think are asked in those settings.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:26):
Love that. All right, Anneka, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?

Anneka Gupta (01:04:29):
I think that's all I can think of.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Anneka Gupta (01:04:35):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Anneka Gupta (01:04:41):
The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz, such a great book, great again about mindset of how to approach hard things. Second is I'm a huge fantasy sci-fi fan, so I love Brandon Sanderson's books. I highly recommend those to people as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
All I know about him is I saw videos of him after COVID where he just said, "I wrote five new books during COVIID." I was like, "what is going on?"

Anneka Gupta (01:05:03):
He is someone that is at the top of his craft and I admire people so much that are truly the elite in what they do, and he's truly the elite in what he does. He writes a lot about writing, he podcasts a lot about writing. It's pretty impressive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
And he writes fantasy books, is that right?

Anneka Gupta (01:05:18):
He writes fantasy, yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:20):
Okay, cool. It feels like a lot of books to read though. I'm just like, "Oh, my God, so many books." Okay, great. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Anneka Gupta (01:05:31):
Again, on the fantasy sci-fi track, I really like Fallout, which is a dystopian show based on a post-apocalyptic, post-nuclear war world. It's very entertaining.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):
Yeah, it's just very quirky and fun.

Anneka Gupta (01:05:45):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):
And unexpected. Awesome. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?

Anneka Gupta (01:05:53):
My eight-foot iPhone charger. So I have a cord that's very long that allows me to move around the house and do stuff while my phone is charging because my phone is always running out of batteries. So, highly recommend getting a super long charging cord.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:10):
I've got one of those and I know exactly what you mean. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work during life?

Anneka Gupta (01:06:18):
I think it comes back to dealing with lots of different types of people. I really try to remind myself that everyone has something to teach and everyone has something to learn. I think that helps not only think about how you interact with other people, but also combat imposter syndrome because you have something to bring to the table and teach as well as anyone else, no matter what your age is, no matter what your background, and leaning into that and realizing that people can learn from you and you can learn from others in every single situation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):
Final question. I heard that you're a big fan of Isaac Asimov. Do you have a favorite Asimov book, one that you'd think if someone were to explore his canon, they might want to start with?

Anneka Gupta (01:07:01):
I really like the Foundation series, so starting with that is really good. It's a very different style of writing. You kind of have to stick with it, but it's good, I promise.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):
And I'll build on that and say, "Don't watch the show because the show is so different from the book series." I don't know if you've seen it and-

Anneka Gupta (01:07:16):
Yes, I have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:17):
... not nearly as good.

Anneka Gupta (01:07:17):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:18):
I was just like, what is going on? This is not the story.

Anneka Gupta (01:07:20):
Yeah, very different.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:21):
What are they doing? Amazing. Anneka, this has been amazing. We covered so much ground. I feel like this is going to help a lot of people. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow up on things, maybe ask you questions or just check out the stuff you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Anneka Gupta (01:07:38):
You can find me on LinkedIn, follow me, DM me. I would love to connect. The way you can help me is we're actually redesigning our Stanford class right now for PMs, and I would love to hear from you if you don't have any PM experience, what is it that you wish a class could teach you? And that would be super helpful for me as we're redesigning this class. Thanks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:59):
Amazing. And the way they could share that is DM you on LinkedIn or Twitter?

Anneka Gupta (01:08:03):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):
Easy. Amazing. Anneka, thank you so much for being here.

Anneka Gupta (01:08:07):
Thanks for having me.

# This will make you a better decision maker | Annie Duke (Thinking In Bets, former pro poker player)

## Transcript

Annie Duke (00:00:00):
It's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit. It's not that intuition is crap, your intuition is sometimes right. If you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
When you look at companies that have read your book, what do you find are the brainwashing tactics that really stick?

Annie Duke (00:00:16):
People generally think the purpose of a meeting is for three things, discover, discuss, decide. The only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
Something that comes up in product a lot is this idea of pre-mortems.

Annie Duke (00:00:28):
So a pre-mortem, it's great only if you set up kill criteria. Commit to actions that you're going to take if you see those signals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
You have a very interesting framework for how to think about decision quality when the outcome is very long-term.

Annie Duke (00:00:40):
There is no such thing as a long feedback loop. And the way you choose to shorten the feedback loop is to say, what are the things that are correlated with the outcome that I eventually desire?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):
Today, my guest is Annie Duke. Annie is the author of the bestselling book Thinking in Bets, and also her more recent book Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away. She's also a special partner at First Round Capital, which we spent some time on and is incredibly fascinating. Prior to this part of her career, she was a professional poker player. She's won over $4 million in tournaments, including winning a World Series of Poker Bracelet, and she's the only woman who's won the World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions and the National Poker Heads-Up Championship. Currently, she spends her time helping companies make better decisions. In our conversation, we cover the many lessons that she's learned from her friend Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed away. What simple change she's found has the most impact in a company's ability to make better decisions, how to make better quick decisions when the feedback loop is very long, and also why she doesn't actually believe in long feedback loops, how she changed the way that the partners at First Round Capital make decisions, which is incredibly interesting.

(00:01:51):
Plus, why when you're thinking about quitting, that probably means you've already waited too long and you should have quit a while ago. I learned a ton from this conversation and this is definitely going to change the way I think about a lot of things. With that, I bring you Annie Duke after a short word from our sponsors.

Annie Duke (00:03:58):
Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:59):
It's my pleasure. I was telling a bunch of people that you were coming on this podcast and every single one of them was so excited that we were doing this, so I'm quite excited that this is happening. I want to start with a question about Daniel Kahneman. I know you two were very close. You did a podcast together. I know you grew to be good friends over the past few years. Sadly, he passed away about a week ago at this point.

Annie Duke (00:04:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:21):
I'm curious, what are some lasting lessons that you took away from your time with him? Maybe one or two things that stick with you and you think will stick with you?

Annie Duke (00:04:31):
It's hard for me to describe properly how humble this man was, and it seems so impossible because his influence was so huge and his intellect was so huge and his insight was so change-making in the areas that he worked. But he was so humble, he really wanted to hear what you thought. He said, "I don't know a lot", he would change his mind. It's funny, I got asked in a class that I was teaching about thinking fast and slow and someone was talking about how there's a lot of studies in there that didn't end up replicating.

(00:05:19):
And what I've seen from a lot of other people in the field who really where their work is defined by some line of work that didn't replicate, where they're really arguing against the fact that it doesn't replicate. Just trying to justify or say, "But no", or this and that. This real lack of open-mindedness to the idea that you know what? Maybe it turns out not to be true and that should be okay. But the thing about Danny was when you talked about it, he was the first one to tell you, "I wish priming wasn't in the book. It doesn't replicate." He was just so open-minded to the idea that he knows what he knows now, but he knows that he doesn't know everything.

(00:06:06):
Another thing that people don't know about him outside of academics I think are that he was one of the pioneers in something called an adversarial collaboration. So one of his favorite things, and he in some ways invented it, was find someone who really disagrees with you and then write a paper with them and try to figure out with them what's the study that would resolve the issue. So an example of that was Danny did work on happiness as it relates to wealth. Kahneman and a collaborator, Angus Deaton, they published a result that got a lot of press about the relationship between money and happiness, and the idea was money doesn't buy happiness beyond $75,000. So that got published in 2010. I'm sure if you ran that exact same study, it would be more than $75,000 now because it would adjust for inflation. But it was like the idea being once your basic needs are met and you're not that worried about paying rent and so on and so forth, it's not going to have that big of an effect.

(00:07:09):
But then a decade later, Matthew Killingsworth said, "That's not true that actually money and happiness are correlated through all the income levels. The more money you have, the more happy you tend to be." Okay, so this is a classic example where people will tear each other down sometimes and that guy's wrong and whatever. And instead, it was Kahneman's like, "All right, let's do it together." And they joined forces along with Barb Mellers to basically try to resolve that issue. He was just always seeking out, it was just like everything was like, why am I wrong? And he was eager and he was excited and he wanted to...

(00:07:56):
I remember having a lunch with him where I realized after the lunch that the whole lunch was him asking me questions about my work. Why is he asking me questions about my work? Right? He's Danny Kahneman. But he was just so curious about other people and he just made time for everybody. He just loved the people around him so much. And I think that in the end, it's hard to believe, but I just think that that dwarfs his body of work, which is spectacular. But he as a human being was just so spectacular. And I do think you hear all the time about people who are so incredibly brilliant. It's the brilliant but asshole thing, and it was just so the opposite with him. He was so kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:51):
That's amazing. And it feels like there's probably a strong correlation between people that are curious, always looking for how they're wrong, and finding time to spend it with people to debate and discuss and ask. Feels like there's going to be a strong correlation with that and finding really interesting insights uncovering new things.

Annie Duke (00:09:10):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 00:09:12].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:11):
Well, thank you. Thank you for sharing all that. I wish I had known him. Let's talk about decision-making. So there's two areas I want to spend time on. As one would not be surprised, decision-making and quitting. And I know that you've been on a lot of podcasts. I imagine many listeners have read your book or have heard a lot about the stuff that you teach. I'm going to try to come at this from a bunch of different directions and do it a little differently. First of all, I know you're a parent. As last I heard, you have four kids. I just had a kid, he's almost 10 months now.

Annie Duke (00:09:43):
Oh, congratulations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:44):
Thank you. I'm curious, what your frameworks you find most helpful in parenting and in raising your kids that have stuck with you there?

Annie Duke (00:09:53):
Well, let me just first off say I get a lot of people who are pregnant who come and ask me for my advice about parenting. And I'll tell you the two pieces of advice I give people. The first is this, there's all sorts of parenting books, there's all sorts of styles. A book needs to sell, so they need to sell you something new or different or whatever, okay. But the only thing that matters really is that your kids know you love them, really know deep in their bones, know you love them.

(00:10:32):
And we can argue breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding or co-sleeping versus not co-sleeping or attachment parenting or sleep training, we can talk about all that stuff, right? Do you homeschool? Do you send them to private school? Do you send them [inaudible 00:10:49]? We can have lots of [inaudible 00:10:51], but it all dwarfs in comparison to your children know that you would lay down in the street in the front of a bus if it meant that they would be alive and happy. That's the number one thing I say. Number two is at some point, you will drop your baby on its head. So I bet this has happened to you already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):
Well, yeah. Sort of. Okay.

Annie Duke (00:11:18):
Sort of, right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):
Keep coming.

Annie Duke (00:11:20):
So here's the thing about babies, is babies can't move. And so you get very used to as a mom or a dad or you're sitting on the couch and you're folding laundry and your baby is right here next to you and your baby can't move. And then one day without warning, your baby can roll over. And you think it's fine because you put a pillow there or something, but you turn your back for a second because you're like whatever and then your baby falls on its head. It happened with every single one of my children. And they don't fall that far and whatever, but they're totally fine and you're not a bad parent. And it's just this, there are things you don't know and stuff's going to happen and it's not going to be perfect. And every little thing isn't going to have some lasting impression on your child because at some point, you will drop your baby on its head and you will not mean to, you didn't intend to.

(00:12:21):
But in my case, it was always like, oh my gosh, my baby can roll over. I did not think that was going to happen today. And gosh, by the time I got to the fourth one, it's like I'm chasing after one baby to try to get the diaper on and this and that, so then the other baby hits its head. So I think there's just a lesson in that which is like it's a small thing, don't sweat it and don't get mad at yourself because you made a mistake. It's like the mistake would be, oh, I realize my baby could roll over now. So now you should make sure that you're taking extra precautions about your baby rolling over off the couch. But it's really just a funny way for me to say your baby's going to hit its head or walk into a coffee table or get cut or whatever. It's like they're very resilient and you didn't do anything wrong as a parent, so don't beat yourself up about that. And then I do actually have one other thing I say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):
Yeah, go for it.

Annie Duke (00:13:21):
Be having four, you have very little, you have no influence whatsoever basically on what your child's personality is. What you can do as a parent is make sure they say please and thank you. So what I find with parents of one is particularly if that one is very well-behaved, they think they're a great parent and they may be. That would be resulting. They may be, but once you have four, what you realize is like, oh, my parenting really didn't have anything to do with it. But my children do say please and thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
This is really valuable, good advice. I need to hear this. My wife is going to need to hear this, too. She's always worried about the soft spot on our kid's head and getting hit into some things.

Annie Duke (00:14:09):
No, it'll be fine.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:10):
Okay, great.

Annie Duke (00:14:11):
It's actually it's part of why it's there. Really, your baby will be fine. I mean, that's the thing. We used to cart babies around in the wilderness, we were living in case. We're fine, we're built for it. We're built for a much rougher world than the world that babies actually grow up in now. I will say my oldest child when she was in high school, just for whatever reason, she had no interest whatsoever in alcohol or drugs or anything like that. And I remember just feeling so smug about how well I had raised this child and how great she was, and oh, these other parents who clearly weren't doing a good job. I mean, I didn't really but because it's hard not to. And then my next child went through high school and I was like, [inaudible 00:15:02]. That's just a temperament thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
It's a good example of resulting in action.

Annie Duke (00:15:08):
It is a good example of resulting, but all my kids have turned out fine and they're all very different, but yeah. But as far as decision-making is concerned, which is a totally different thing, I'll actually quote Danny Kahneman on this one. Nothing is as important as it seems when you're thinking about it, that's a really important one. One of the things that I used to try to do with my kids all the time was mental time travel, which is actually a very good decision tool. So they would be really upset about something and it could be something that happened at school or it could be like they were grounded for something or whatever.

(00:15:46):
And the thing is when you're in the moment, it just feels like so big. And the thing that I used to say and they say all the time now is this is going to be so great for you when you're 40 at Thanksgiving. You're going to be able to tell these stories to your children and it's going to be the best, like you should be thanking me so that you can talk about your crazy mother at the Thanksgiving table. And it allowed them to get some time and space from it to realize this is going to be funny at some point.

(00:16:19):
At some point, it's going to be a hilarious story that you tell people. No matter how horrible it seems now, it's going to be a hilarious story at some point when you're older. And it sounds like a fun thing I was doing with them, but it's actually a really good decision-making tool for us in general, right? Look, there are absolutely things that 20 years from now are going to matter, for sure. But most things, no. If you think about most things that ever happen to you, like you're 21 and your girlfriend breaks up with you or whatever and you just think it's the end of the world and you're never going to recover and all these things, but if you could get yourself like, well, how do I really think I'm going to think about this in 10 years? Am I still going to be heartbroken in 10 years?

(00:17:03):
Probably not. And I think that we need to get that perspective of time so that we can get out of the moment because in the moment it just feels so important and the feelings are so big. And it's like the focusing effect on this second and the feelings you're feeling right now are so huge that we forget the scope of time. And I think that that's absolutely one of the best things you can do with your kids, and you can do it in small ways too, right? You can choose to play this video game or you can choose to study for your task. A week from now when you get that test back, how do you think you're going to feel about those two choices? Right?

(00:17:43):
So that was a tool that I used a ton and it's just generally an amazing decision-making tool, just generally for people. It's one that I happen to use with my kids all the time. And then I would say that the other one was using the word nevertheless, which is this is a great leadership skill, the word nevertheless. So let's say my child got caught doing something wrong. I don't know, I found a bag of red solo cups in my backyard that they forgot to throw out after a weekend that I was away. That's hypothetical. So I'm grounding them and it's a lot of argument back, right? So they think this is a debate and they're giving me all of their input and their opinions on why it's unfair and all the other kids do it and the other parents don't get mad and whatever, whatever the argument is. You have to have the balance between them feeling heard, which I think is incredibly important that your children feel heard, and following through on what you know or believe is right.

(00:18:56):
So it's I hear you. Nevertheless, you're grounded for two weeks. I hear what you're saying and I understand. Nevertheless, this is what's going to happen. And obviously, the words that you can use for that might be different. You have so much more authority obviously over your children than you do in other places. But in the workplace, this is very good because employees gripe all the time at decisions that you make in leadership because they think they're right and they want their way. And to have the ability to say, I heard you and your input, trust me, was incorporated into the decision, nevertheless, this is the path we're going to take. Right or wrong, that's what we're going to do. So I think there's a lot of things that basically you can say. These are good things to do with kids, but they're actually just generally really good decision strategies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:47):
I'm taking notes on all these things. These are going to be extremely useful.

Annie Duke (00:19:51):
Nevertheless is a really good one with children.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):
It connects to something Dr. Becky teaches, if you know her, of telling someone, "I believe you." When your kid says something and they're upset about something, start with I believe you.

Annie Duke (00:20:03):
Nevertheless.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:03):
And here's nevertheless, exactly. Fair enough. I think we're going to start having to pivot this podcast to a parenting podcast because there's so much stuff here, but I'm going to try to resist. So we've been talking about decision-making and frameworks and things like that. Something I wanted to ask you is how much better can someone get at making better decisions? So for example, say someone listens to all of your podcasts, reads your book, studies it intensely. What's the delta you find in somebody being able to make a better decision? And where [inaudible 00:20:35] comes from is Daniel Kahneman of all people. People ask him, "Do you just live such a optimal life now that you know all of these biases we have and all these mental errors we make?" And he's like, "No, I can't..." I think he said famously, "I don't, actually. I can't use these in practice. This is just stuff that I have learned, but it doesn't actually impact my day to day." So I'm curious just how much better can someone get? What kind of delta have you found in terms of making decisions?

Annie Duke (00:20:59):
Okay, so it depends on whether you actually do the things. I mean, I think that that's what the issue is. I think Kahneman did some work way back that started him on this journey. That was basically work on hiring and it was taking it from completely unstructured Lenny, saying, "I just know a great product manager when I see one", whatever that means, to me going to Lenny and saying, "Okay, I understand that you think that you see a great product manager you know one when you see one", but can you explain to me what that means? In the abstract, what are the things that you're looking for in someone that you want to fill that role? And we can then excavate that, right? And make what is implicit because you're applying some implicit model to how you're thinking about the person that you're interviewing and how they map onto the role that they're going to be, but let's make that explicit.

(00:22:04):
So we can make that explicit, we can turn it into a decision rubric, we can create a structured interview process out of that. And then what he found was after you've gone through that process, if you then use your intuition after having done that, not before, that then you actually can really drastically improve your hit rate on hiring. And in that case, it was from about a 50% hit rate to 65. So that's pretty huge, so that's a really big difference. The problem is nobody does it. So I can tell you that most of the conversations that I had with Danny that were about my work in particular were just him saying, "How do you get anybody to do it?" Now that's not to say that I would be better at that than him, it's that he didn't do my job, right? So he was an academic doing research and so on and so forth, I'm living in companies embedding for years.

(00:23:02):
I've been with one client for five years, one client for four years, one client for four years also, almost four years, three and a half years. And then I just took on a new client who I've been with for six months, and that's my whole client roster because I stay with them so long. So if you do it, the answer is quite a bit. Like at least in terms of Danny's work in relation to something pretty noisy like hiring, you went from 50% hit rate to 65% hit rate, which is huge. It's enormous. The problem is that the way that you can make decisions in order to be better at them is not supernatural to the way that humans make decisions.

(00:23:47):
I think we think a lot more highly of our intuition than we really ought to. We think very highly of our ability to notice things in the moment and act rationally toward them in a way that really we ought not to. We tend to think that we have insight that other people don't have when actually the other people probably have more insight into our situation than we do. So I think the answer is a lot with a big if, with an if you can get people to do it. And I think that's where the issue comes in. Now, the good news is that you can then reverse that and say if I'm willing to do it, think about what an edge I'm going to have over people who aren't willing to do it, right?

(00:24:36):
So we can think there's people who don't know about it, there's people who do know about it but don't do it, and then there's people who do know about it, but do do it. And it's that last group that's so tiny. So the answer is I think a lot, but nobody does it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):
So maybe following that thread, when you look at companies that you've worked with or companies that have read your book and really dove in and started to implement some of your piece of advice to make better decisions, if you could look back at the ones that had an impact, what do you find are the mental models or frameworks or tactics that really stick that most often have an impact and the biggest impact?

Annie Duke (00:25:18):
I think the one that's easiest to implement is this. And it's so easy, and I just wish more people would do it. The best way to get somebody's opinion is independently of other people's opinions, independently asynchronously. So the way that I put is I want people to stop talking to each other so much. When we think about what did people generally think the purpose of a meeting is, they think it's for three things. Discovery, which is I want to discover what your opinions are, what your judgments are of something, right? So I want to find out what you think about something. So for example, if we're in product development and we're trying to figure out a timeline, we're trying to develop a product roadmap and we're trying to figure out how long it's going to take to release certain features or something like that, we all come into a room and we start yelling it out together.

(00:26:29):
It's so bad for decision-making, I can't even tell you. There's cross influence, the loudest person in the room tends to then have an outsized influence on the decision, the most confident person in the room tends to have an outsized influence on the decision. And that's great if the most confident person is also right, but the problem is that's not always so. And so that's the discovery piece, right? And we tend to do that in a group. And then there's discussion, which is I've now discovered the way that Lenny is modeling this problem or what his judgments are about certain things or his forecasts are, his estimates are. And now, we're going to discuss those ideas and we're going to discuss your ideas in comparison to my ideas, and that's going to happen in the group setting. And then there's also now, we're going to decide in the group setting. So we're going to make some set of decisions about say what the roadmap is going to look like.

(00:27:26):
Here's the thing that I think is the easiest to change, is to realize the only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part. So we should absolutely be coming together as human beings to discuss everybody's judgments and opinions and the way they're modeling the problem and their forecasts. In particular, it's really good to come in and discuss the places where people are different. So you've been in many meetings, I'm sure about 80% of the time is double clicking. Oh, I agree. And I want to now we've literally just used different words to say the exact same thing because I'm in agreement.

(00:28:07):
If we can focus the discussion on places that people disagree, we're much better off. But so now we can take this, discover, discuss, decide. So I'm saying discuss is only supposed to happen in the meeting, that's the only thing that's supposed to happen in the meeting. So what's happening with the other stuff, the discover and the decide? Well, and this is the thing that I think I actually have been able to get people to do is discover what people think before you get in a room independently of each other. So how would you do that? Well, let's imagine that you're going to have a meeting about the product roadmap.

(00:28:43):
So you would say to yourself in this meeting, what are the opinions that I need to get from the people in the room? It could be a brainstorm. What are all the different features that we could develop? So it could be a brainstorm. Fine. Write to them independently and say, "Hey, free for off. Just come up with all the different features that you think would be reasonable for us to consider developing and then give me a forced rank from best to worst of your own ideas with some three to five sentence rationale as to why you have these things in this order." And so I could do that, but maybe we already have a list. I can send that out for a forced rank to everybody. Okay, so here's the final list of things we're really considering. Prioritize those for me, just force rank them. And then again, give me a rationale.

(00:29:32):
Give me a little bit of free writing as to why you think this should be, that you have these things in this order. Maybe we've decided now on what our top five priorities are. Great. I could, before the meeting, send the top five priorities out. "Hey, we've decided on this stuff." For each thing, I'd like to understand what you think a reasonable timeline is, how many sprints it's going to take, so on, so forth, right? So we can ask for that type of information so that we can start making estimates because that's going to affect budget and what we're going back to the board with and so on so forth. But regardless, just figure out what is the thing that we're going to be discussing in this meeting? And I'm going to send it out to everybody independently and I'm going to say, "Don't reply all, just send it back to me independently."

(00:30:14):
If it's a repeated decision, you can actually create a rubric that lives on Airtable or Coda or Google Sheets or whatever, I don't really care. And people can input their decisions there where they can't see anybody else's decision. So with Google, you can use Google Forms in order to do it, and then it dumps into a spreadsheet that only you can see. That's a great way to do it. So anyway, so you do that and now you can now see everybody's opinions that you then now send out to the group and say, "Everybody, look this over before we come in and discuss." So notice you're still working as a group, but you're working as a group where you're not in the same room together and talking at the same time. And there's a word for that, which is nominal group. So it's a group that at that moment is working independently and asynchronously of each other.

(00:31:03):
So if you can get people to do that, and I do have companies where I don't consult with them, but I've just come in and talked to them briefly or whatever that do actually implement that piece of it. That is a huge piece of it, that's ginormous. And then you do the same thing for deciding. So the decision should not be made in a room, it's made either. I love the one decision maker model, but not everybody's down with that. But you can have a vote forum where people go vote in private about the way they're leaning.

(00:31:39):
You can do a variety of things with that, but just don't do it. Don't do it in the meeting. And then just the last thing that I'll add, which is a muscle that you really have to exercise, is I think it's really important to understand that the word alignment in terms of we're all aligned as a group, right? The word alignment is stupid and it shouldn't be used. And I know I'm saying that very harshly, but it's true. It's dumb because it doesn't exist. You have 10 people in a room and they're all really different people with different opinions, and they're never going to come out of the room agreeing with each other. And it's really bad if the expectation is that they're supposed to, and it's really bad for a few reasons. One is it isn't reality, and that I don't like coming out of things without reality actually kicking.

(00:32:38):
So it's not reality. People don't actually agree, they're not actually aligned on the decision. That's just the thing that makes you feel better, right? So I think that that's problem number one. But problem number two is that if the goal is alignment, if the goal is agreement, then the meeting becomes coercive and you never want that. So the way that I'm supposed to talk about my ideas is to convey why I believe what I do, not to convince anybody that I'm right because if I'm working to convince people that I'm right, it becomes coercive and that's horrible. So you have to get comfortable with walking out of the room. This is the nevertheless. Walking out of the room understanding that once you have that discussion, it's not that Lenny, your opinion might change. It could, right? I could say my thing and it could be just so damn brilliant that you change your mind somewhat, right?

(00:33:37):
So you come maybe you're like, "Oh, I'm thinking about this differently and actually", but maybe you don't and you still believe a thing that's very different than me. And leadership has to say, "That's fine. I've heard both of you and I know that this isn't going Annie's way. Nevertheless, trying to think about what all of our goals are, this is what the decision is going to be and it's totally fine that you ended up not agreeing with each other because it's reality. And what it allows me to do is get a better sense of what the space of decisions is." So those things I have been able to get people to do and they're actually quite impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:17):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10X increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision-makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated two to five X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.

(00:35:14):
Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. There's an implication here you touched on a bit that there's a DRI essentially, there's one decision maker. Sometimes people start to feel like, "Oh, my voice isn't heard. I don't have a lot of say, I can't be part of this decision." And you talked a bunch about just how to make people feel included, you get feedback along the way. But any advice there if you try to move to this model of making people feel like, "Okay, I actually have impact on where this goes"?

Annie Duke (00:35:58):
Yeah. So here's the really wonderful thing about moving from a coercive model to really, I guess you could say a model of curiosity, right? You want to be curious, not coercive, which means that the way that people in the meeting are talking about what their opinions are is in the mode of conveying information, not trying to convince anybody. So once we move away from that coercive model, and when I say coercive, I'm not saying anybody is purposely trying to set up a culture of coercion. Sometimes that's true, but for the most part, everybody's trying to do a good job and nobody's trying to set up a culture of coercion. But as soon as you say, "Are we all in agreement? Are we all in alignment?" And as soon as you're allowing people, and I'm sure you've been in these meetings, right? If you allow people to interrupt, if you allow people to say this, "I think you're wrong", "I disagree", "Here's why", those are all very coercive things to have happen.

(00:37:12):
Interrupting someone is silencing them. Saying, "You're wrong", well now, you become tribal and people aren't going to be open-minded and they're going to stake their ground and it's all really bad. So let's move away from that. Number one, that's already going to help. But when we think about the way that meetings normally happen, again, there's all this crosstalk and some people aren't speaking and some people are and so on, so forth. And then of course, not everybody feels equally heard. But when you work as a nominal group, let's talk about something as simple as we're going to make a forecast of how long it's going to take to launch this product feature. Okay. So I'm going to send out to everybody, what's your point estimate? What's your lower bound? What's your upper bound in terms of timeline?

(00:38:02):
And you could do it in some way, like how many sprints do you think is going to take whatever language you want to use? Now, everybody independently now gives their forecast with a rationale for why they believe that. And then you come into the room and you run a discussion where everybody's getting to say what their estimate was and why they believe that, and people are getting to ask questions. "I have a question" always is a clarification, it's just I don't understand. And as the leadership, the way that you would do it is, let me give you an example from a real one because that'll be easy. I did one of these discussions for a question about remote work, like what did the company want in terms of remote versus hybrid and that kind of thing. And so there was a lot of disagreement about whether whatever the policy was, it should be consistent across functions. Lots of disagreement.

(00:39:01):
So let's take somebody who was on the, no, it shouldn't be consistent across functions. So they now say why they believe it shouldn't be consistent across functions and they say things like, "Well, different functions have different requirements, right?" So there's some functions that have to be in the office, like if you're IT as an example, but there's other functions which are more collaborative and creative and whatnot where it makes sense for people to be in the office, whereas engineers doesn't really matter, right? So there's different needs of different functions in terms of how much they need to be in the same space. So I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with this, I'm just saying what somebody said. So now as a facilitator, I never say, "Oh, I agree." What I say is I just want to make sure I understood what you said and I reflect it back.

(00:39:57):
So I say, "So what I heard you say is that not all functions are created equal in terms of how well they work remotely or how well they work in person or what the flexibility might be. So what you're saying is there're functions that have to be in person. Period. And then other functions where that collaborative element being in the same office would be more important versus some functions where being remote is totally fine. Is that what you meant?" And then they have the ability to say, "Yes, that is what I meant" or, "Actually, I meant something slightly different. Let me say what that is", and then I reflect that back. Okay, so literally you're just going around, you're calling on people to do that, and then you're reflecting back what they say without offering your own opinion. I don't know, Lenny. Tell me how someone doesn't feel heard in that situation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:48):
Yeah. Absolutely. I would feel so good if somebody just clarified and made it clear they know exactly what I'm saying, even if the decision doesn't end up the way I want.

Annie Duke (00:40:57):
Right, so that's the thing. And then what actually ends up happening is that the people in the room feel more, the psychological term would be endowed, more endowed to the decision. In other words, they feel like they have ownership over the decision. And whatever the decision is, they generally will see their selves reflected in it because they were heard. And they also will generally understand that nobody, no one really ends up with exactly every single thing that they wanted to see in the decision because they also get to see the true spread of opinions on the team. And what you see in that situation is that there's lots and lots and lots and lots of disagreement, which you don't see if you talk in a group. It narrows the space, right?

(00:41:48):
So for example, particularly if you're senior, if you say, "I think this is going to take three months to launch" and I was thinking four weeks, you're never going to hear four weeks from me, ever. But if we get those opinions independently, you will actually hear that I think it's going to take four weeks. You may tend to be more right there being more senior, but I may have something interesting to say. You should hear what I have to say. And this also allows me to learn from you, too. But because I haven't heard your opinion first, then I'm not going to conform my opinion to yours. So it actually spreads the surface area of disagreement that you see on the team, which then makes people feel much better about the decision not being exactly what they want because they recognize like, "Oh, this is actually a hard problem. People really disagree on this stuff."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:41):
Amazing. I think this is going to be really helpful to a lot of people. Just to close the thread on this little summary maybe is core advice here is brainstorm separately. So I guess first, there's discover, discuss, decide. To discover ideas completely independently, basically brainstorms. You're a big advocate of brainstorming independently, sitting on your own, thinking through ideas. And then bringing people together to discuss all the things they've come up with and especially where they disagree. And then ideally having one person that makes a decision once she or he has taken all the input.

Annie Duke (00:43:12):
Yeah, you can have one person. I mean, I work with people where it's like a partnership and there's six people who are going to vote, but they still do it independently. They go to a forum. So I don't know what your vote is. And all six people don't have to agree. I mean, I just think it's really important that once you get above an end of one, you shouldn't necessarily expect the people to agree, which I think is just really important. And this is good for more than just brainstorming. It's for forecasting, any kind of project planning, budgeting. Yeah, I mean, we do this, for example, at First Round, we have a structured forum for evaluating a company in terms of whether you should invest in it because there are facts and then there are the way that you model those facts in. So it's a lot, what are the investor's opinion of the founder and the product and that kind of thing.

(00:44:06):
And we just have structure around how we're eliciting those opinions, which is really helpful. The other thing that I'll just add to what you said is that you can actually be in the same room together and still discover information independently. So this will happen on the fly all the time where people are talking and they start talking. Something comes up, like someone suggests some new feature or something like that, and then people start saying, "Yeah, but that's going to take..." And you go, "Stop. Okay, everybody take out a piece of paper." So you can still get that same independence on the fly as well as doing it in advance. But yes, that was a very nice summary.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):
If this is just the one thing people take away from this conversation already, I think that could have a big impact. Speaking of First Round, one, we actually just had Todd Jackson on the podcast talking about-

Annie Duke (00:44:59):
Love Todd.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:59):
... love Todd, talking about product market fit. That episode will have come out before this episode. Also, so I asked Brett Berson, your colleague at First Round, what to ask you.

Annie Duke (00:45:00):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):
Yeah, yeah. By the way, your title of First Round is amazing, special partner. I've never seen that before.

Annie Duke (00:45:15):
I am. It's a title just for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):
Oh, my God.

Annie Duke (00:45:17):
I adore Brett Berson.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):
Me, too.

Annie Duke (00:45:19):
So I'm interested, I'm interested in what he said you should ask me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):
Nothing too spicy, it's along the lines of what you talked about. So you said that you have a very interesting framework for how to think about decision quality in the short term when the outcome is very long term. For example, investing. Also, many decisions we make in business, things you need to decide now that you only find out years from now. Can you talk about your advice there and your insights here?

Annie Duke (00:45:43):
Oh my gosh, I'm so happy that that's the question that he asked.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):
Yep, I see.

Annie Duke (00:45:47):
Okay, so can I give a tiny bit of background to this?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):
Absolutely.

Annie Duke (00:45:50):
So prior to talking to First Round, I have another client too who, they're amazing, Renegade Partners at Roseanne Wincek and Renata Quintini. They're incredible. Before finally hooking up with them, and they work at different stages, First Round is C, obviously. Renegade is more like A B, tiny bit of dabble in C. But before running into them, I talked to quite a few venture firms who are interested in talking to me post-Thinking in Bets having come out, so this would be 2018. And there was a theme, there was a theme across them all. The first one was, well, the kind of decision-making you're talking about we don't need to do because we just know a good founder when we see one. So that is a sentence that came out of many people's mouths. And as I just said to you, okay, I have no doubt, but don't you want [inaudible 00:46:52] make that explicit?

(00:46:53):
There's all sorts of great things that come from making it explicit, not just in terms of the increase in decision quality in the moment, but it actually allows you to close feedback loops much better. So that was one thing that I found quite surprising. But the one that I really found very interesting was being told, "Well, what you're talking about doesn't apply because our feedback loops are a decade." And in poker, you got an answer right away. You won or lost the hand right away. So the way that you're thinking about decision-making doesn't really apply, until I met First Round and then Renegade where they actually heard what I had to say because I gave the same answer to everybody. So we'll just put aside that wouldn't you want to make that explicit. The first thing that I would say is, oh, poker is much noisier than you think because when I win a hand, I have no idea why.

(00:47:50):
So I do actually have to wait a long time because I have to play many, many, many hands before I actually know, do I actually have an edge? Because I actually don't know very much. On one hand, for one thing, I almost never see my opponent's card, so I'm left in a dust of uncertainty. But separately from that, the main thing that I said was, how could you possibly think that the feedback loop is 10 years? And this is what I think really caught First Round's eye because when I was talking to Josh Kopelman about it, he said, "Well, what do you mean? We don't get an exit for 10 years." And I said, "Oh, I'm sorry, do you invest? And then you go to sleep like Rip Van Winkle? And then you wake up 10 years later and you go, 'Hey, how'd that go?' Or are there all sorts of things that happen in between?" The simplest thing, the simplest thing is does it fund at Series A?

(00:48:46):
And the little pushback that I would get there is, but we're not investing for Series A. And I say, "Well, I know that", but have you ever had a company that exited for more than a billion dollars that did not fund at Series A? And the answer is no. And I'm like, okay. So it sounds like that's necessary. Might not be sufficient, but it's necessary. And it's certainly a signal that is actually more highly correlated with exiting out well than the investment at C. And then, oh, right, you have series B. And that's separate from all the other things that you can look at, like what you talked to Todd Jackson about. Is it achieving product market fit? We know that eventually for it to be successful, it's going to have to achieve product market fit, right? So you can look at what's happening with that, just general things about traction, what's happening with net new ARR, ability to retain top talent churn.

(00:49:55):
I mean, there's so many different things that you can look at, all of which are things that you know must happen in order for the big thing to happen. Okay, so what that means is that this is the big, I'm going to make a bold statement here. There is no such thing as a long feedback loop. You can make a decision about how long the feedback loop is. That is your choice to live in a long feedback loop, and you can choose to shorten the feedback loop. And the way you choose to shorten the feedback loop is to say, what are the things that are necessary but not sufficient? That's one thing, for getting a good exit, or what are the things that are correlated with the outcome that I eventually desire? And what that means is that when you're at the decision point, right? Like in First Round's case, I'm going to invest in a company.

(00:50:51):
What you have to understand is that you are making a prediction about how the world is going to unfold, how the future is going to unfold. And those things that you're predicting. You can track, and you can track them back to the decision and you can do it pretty darn fast, mind you. I mean, think about being in 2021. There were companies that were raising in A six months after seed. Today, it's a little more 16 months-ish. But even so, let's just say that that was the only thing that you decided to do. I'm going to forecast the probability that this company's going to fund at Series A. And then obviously, those companies start to fund or not fund at Series A and you're finding that out in 16 months. Here's my question for you, Lenny. Is 16 months shorter than 10 years?

(00:51:38):
So it's probably why he said to ask me that question because I just really do. I mean, I have a very strong opinion about this. The feedback loop is as long as you choose it to be. And if I take that back to some of the things that I heard early on when I was talking to people, what I would say is that I think that there is a certain amount of psychological safety in allowing the feedback loop to stay long because really of two main factors. One is that, look, if I was early into Uber and now I'm a celebrity investor or something, I don't really want to know if I'm good or not. Do I? Right? I don't really want the world to know that. I mean, if I'm good, that's great. But it feels like they already believe that I'm good because I happen to be early into Uber.

(00:52:47):
So since people already think I'm good, I'm just losing to that decision, psychologically speaking. Not investment quality speaking, but psychologically speaking. Okay, so here's the problem though. Why was I early into Uber? Did I have an insight into a real pain point in a developing market, blah, blah, blah? Or did my buddy start Uber and I was like, "Sure, I'll give you some money?" Right? I mean, obviously, I'm talking about the extremes here, but we don't actually know what the decision quality was, right? All we know is that you had a good result and given that you had a good result and people think very highly of you, what are you going to gain? Right? So it's so nice to just let that feedback loop sit there and allow people to have the opinion of you. That is really nice, feels good, right? And not actually find out the answer because why would I want to?

(00:53:51):
Unless you're really super focused on decision quality, then you would want to do that. So that's part of the psychological safety. And what that goes to is, the real core of it is that it's very, very difficult for human beings to deal with feeling wrong in the moment, even if it helps them in the long run. It's just hard. And the tighter the feedback loop, the more that you risk finding out you are wrong in the short run. Now that helps you to learn and improve your decision-making if you're focused on it and you're good at it, right? That's going to help you. And then in the long run, you're actually going to do better. But human beings are notoriously good at trading off the long run just to feel good in the short run. That's why we're all eating chocolate and cupcakes and stuff that we know is bad for us because it feels good.

(00:54:45):
And so much of our decision-making is trying to advance this positive self-narrative and the idea that yeah, we're going to have a more positive narrative ourselves in five years if we do some stuff. Most of us are like, "No, I don't really want to make that trade. I'd rather just feel good now", and I can use the fact that we are living in power law, under the influence of power law. I can use that to just confirm a lot of things that I wish to believe that are true of me. And if you take that away from me and you take the uncertainty away from me, it's going to be really hard. And I will tell you that's what I love about both Renegade and First Round is that they're just like, I want to know. It would be such a horror for me to think that I was making good decisions when I actually wasn't. And that's what really matters to me and I think that it's just so special.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):
Hearing all this makes me want to be an LP in First Round. Not that they would let me in there, but just knowing that you're in there futzing with everything and the way they're thinking is really inspiring. I'm curious if you could share an example of anything that they tweaked as a result of this analysis that you did and how they evaluate.

Annie Duke (00:56:05):
Well, first of all, let me just say they didn't really record a lot about their decisions when I first came in. They voted and they had a record of the vote so they knew who said yes and who said no, but they didn't have a lot of other information. So the first thing that happened was just that. Okay, what do we really think is the way that you would model whether you should invest or not invest in? Very broadly, you would say you're reading the market, the team, the founder, the product broadly. We're going to make sure that those opinions aren't just like it's good or it's bad, but it's on a scale of one to seven so that we can actually get some precision and some spread among the partners in terms of, say, strength of market. We're going to make sure that we have shared definitions of those things, which you'd be surprised people don't.

(00:57:00):
So when I am thinking about market and market quality, I might be thinking about something very different than you. So we want to make sure that we have a shared definition of that, and that's reflected in something that we would call mediating judgments, which are judgments that you make related to market prior to actually judging what you think of the market in general. So you could think of something like competitive landscape, so you would judge that. So that turns into what these mediating judgments are, which is basically an implied definition.

(00:57:30):
So you create that, and then you also think about what are the forecasts that are important. One thing that you already know is you're going to forecast the probability the company funds at Series A. So that was a huge change, just a very different way of making decisions. What we've been able to do with that now because I've been there for five years is we now can actually look, say the partnership as a whole, and look at these ratings that they're making of the component pieces of parts of how they're modeling, like what makes a good investment, these forecasts that they're making.

(00:58:03):
And we actually know how these companies have now unfolded. So in the simplest sense, we know whether hundreds of companies have funded at Series A or not. And now, we can actually look and say, how good are the partners at actually forecasting this thing? Right? Are they random? Are they better than random? And we actually know that and we can feed that back to them so that they can understand their own accuracy around these pieces of the decision because the fact is that whatever a seed investor says to you, whether that company is going to fund at Series A is part of their decision. It's included in the decision. So they're making that forecast whether they make the forecast explicitly or not. So what we're saying over at First Round is let's make it explicit because you're doing it implicitly anyway, and then we can actually start to look at your accuracy.

(00:58:58):
We can now feed that back to you and let you know how accurate you are, which will then help you to become more accurate, right? We can also look, because we know in any given vintage what are the best companies or what are the worst companies. Remember, we're having people do these ratings on a scale of one to seven of say the quality of the market, and we can look across the partnership and say, "Look, Lenny, when you think the market is great, how does that map onto how well the company is doing in the future? When you say the market is terrible, how well does that map onto how that company is doing, how that company ends up doing in the future?" And I can come to you and I can say, "Oh, Lenny, by the way, your judgments about market are amazing."

(00:59:47):
You know a good market when you see one and it's really mapping on in a great way onto how that company unfolds, but you're not so great with founder, or maybe you're great across the board, or maybe you're not. So we can now start to give people, we can give the partners insight into their own decision-making, not only to allow them to improve the decision-making, but also to allow them to understand not to over index on certain things that maybe aren't as predictive as an example for them. We also can change the rubric based on the evidence now.

(01:00:22):
So the first version of the rubric is always taking the intuitions of the partners and making those explicit, but then we can start to loop those back together and understand, well, maybe this thing that the partners thought was important actually isn't predictive across any partner. For example, we can start to develop the rubric based on the data. These were all things that weren't possible because prior to that, if I had come in and said, "Well, let's look at decision quality", how would I do that? I mean, I have no idea why people were... I just know whether they said yes or no. And so it's very difficult to them to start to do some really serious refining of the decisions if I don't have that information.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:08):
I desperately want to know which partner it makes the best decisions. I know you're not going to share them.

Annie Duke (01:01:13):
No, I'm not going to. The partnership as a whole is excellent as we know. And this is what I will tell you is that all partners have strengths and all partners have weaknesses, and they're not perfectly overlapping, which is wonderful, right? I mean, that's one of the things. It's like what's really wonderful, and I think it shows the power of why would you have more than one person having input into a decision, is some people are very strong on rating a particular aspect of market, or some people are very strong on rating a particular aspect of the founder. There's overlap and then there's things where Todd is uniquely great at something, or Josh is uniquely great at something, or Bill is uniquely great at something. So that's a wonderful thing about it is that everybody has strengths and everybody has weaknesses and they're not perfectly overlapping. So this is where you can see getting that spread of opinions and really understanding, breaking that decision down into its component parts really shows you the value of diverse opinions as input into a decision.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):
I could talk about this thread forever. Maybe let me just ask one more question just because I'm super curious. Is there anything surprising that stands out, that came out of this analysis so far? Just like, oh wow, maybe market isn't as important as we thought or this person is amazing at-

Annie Duke (01:02:34):
Yes. So I think just generally speaking, when you're creating the initial decision rubric, there are things that people are really pounding the table about that they think is especially important in making a decision. And one of the things that we found is that sometimes their intuition was absolutely right. The thing that they were pounding the table about is incredibly predictive, not just for them but other partners. But sometimes it's not at all predictive, and these are equal table-pounding situations. So let's say you're pounding the table about something, sometimes the thing you're pounding at the table about is predictive for you and for all the other partners that it's actually quite predictive about how the company does. But sometimes when you're really pounding the table about something, it's not just that it's not predictive for the other partners, it's not predictive for you.

(01:03:33):
And I think that what's really important to understand about this, and this is why it's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit, is that our intuition is sometimes right and sometimes wrong. It's not that intuition is crap and your intuition is just completely wrong, I mean obviously, that can't be true. We would die, right? So your intuition is sometimes right, but it's also sometimes wrong. And if you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong.

(01:04:07):
You don't get to find out when it's off base, and that's a disaster. So that's the thing that I think is really interesting is that you have equal vehement and confidence that this particular factor is really important. And sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. And it's so surprising because we're talking about people who are true experts who are great, and I think that we all just have intuition about intuition, right? You just intuit that if they're so amazing, clearly their intuition about what's important would have to be good, but not necessarily. That's the thing, not necessarily. Yeah, I think that was probably the most exciting thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):
Keeping it mysterious, but I still appreciate you sharing.

Annie Duke (01:04:59):
Well, I have to keep it mysterious.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):
Yes, I understand.

Annie Duke (01:05:03):
I can't give away the trade secrets.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):
I wanted to touch on a different framework that I've heard a lot of companies actually using, and something that comes up in product a lot is this idea of pre-mortems, which is essentially think ahead of time what might go wrong. Can you talk about this? Because I think that it's something that's easy to implement, really powerful, and a lot of people are actually doing this.

Annie Duke (01:05:25):
Yes, okay. So a pre-mortem is great, but only if you attach a pre-commitment with it. So I just want to be super clear about that. What you find with pre-mortems, this actually work. I actually did this work with Maurice Schweitzer and Linnea Gandhi, who are both at Penn. Then when you have people do pre-mortems, it generally doesn't actually change their plan very much or it changed their behavior. So I think that we have the feeling that if you do a pre-mortem and you think what are the ways that things might go wrong, that that's going to change your plan, but probably not unless you're specifically using it for that purpose and you say, "Okay, we're going to do this, but let's think about how we might change our plan in light of this information." But I think what's actually more important than that is what a pre-mortem allows you to do is to set up kill criteria.

(01:06:18):
So kill criteria are just a set of signals that you might see that would tell you that it's time to pivot or stop because once we actually launch something, we're very, very slow to decide to quit. I'm sure that everybody has felt that way before. Things go on way too long, even like they're over budget and you've blown the timeline. And when you finally shut it down, you realize you should have done it a lot earlier. And this is true across the board because of a variety of biases. The most well-known, and probably the biggest influence is something called sunk cost, which is that feeling, but then I'll have wasted all the time and effort that I've put into this already. So it's taking into account what you've put in in the past and deciding whether to continue on in the future. So what we want to do is actually just get better at that thing. So understanding that when you've gotten to the pre-mortem process, you probably are going to launch it, like it's probably going to be the case.

(01:07:22):
Use the pre-mortem to set up kill criteria. So I'll give you an example from a sales team that I worked with. Basically, I sent them out a prompt, all the IC is a prompt that was, imagine that you got a lead through an RFP or RFI and you worked on it for six months. And now, it's six months later and the deal is dead. Looking back, you realized they were early signals that that was going to be the case, what were they. So this is a pre-mortem. What are the things that you saw that would tell you that this was going to go south? And they came up with all sorts of ideas. Notice this doesn't mean they're not going to start off pursuing the lead, right? But they saw, they came up with all sorts of signals. So I'll just give you three of them.

(01:08:12):
The RFP RFI was clearly written with a competitor in mind, so they felt that was a very bad signal that was probably going to go badly. Another one was the customer didn't want to demo, they only wanted to talk about price. Obviously, that's quite bad. And another one was after the first few meetings, they couldn't get a decision maker in the room, right? So it was a much longer list than this, but those are three. So for each of those, that now becomes a kill criteria if I see this thing and now you attach an action with it. So in the case of price, they actually just said, "We should kill it." If they literally don't want to demo and they're only asking about price, they're just trying to beat up somebody else on price like we're a box-checking exercise. So there, they just said, "We're going to kill it. We're not going to pursue the deal anymore."

(01:08:59):
So this is great because salespeople will pursue deals forever and leadership is like, "Well, why did you stop pursuing that deal?" And they get in trouble for it. So this is going to help with that problem, right? In the case of the RFP RFI was written with a competitor in mind, they have an action associated with that as well, which is ask them directly if they're working with a competitor and how far down the road they are, depending on the answer you would kill or pursue. In the case of we couldn't get a decision maker in the room, offer up executive alignment at the next meeting. And if they say sure, great. And if they say no, kill.

(01:09:35):
So that's actually what I feel is the best use of a pre-mortem is to say, I'm going to try to figure out what those signals are along the way that things are going badly. And now instead of just hoping that when I see those signals, I actually act rationally, which is a hope that it will not come true. That's why there's many people who climb Everest in the middle of a blizzard, even though they shouldn't be doing that. Use the pre-mortem to now create structure around those signals that you've spotted and commit to actions that you're going to take if you see those signals. And I think that's the best use of a pre-mortem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:15):
That's really helpful. And it's interesting how many of your examples come back to just of a framework that you often talk about, which is make it explicit what is implicit. There's another example that the First Round example is a great example of that where it's just, here's all our assumptions, they just make them actually explicit and just shows how much [inaudible 01:10:32].

Annie Duke (01:10:32):
Right, then you can examine them. You can examine them, people can discuss them, you can figure out if they're wrong or right or whatever. It's like, I want to be very clear, I'm not anti your gut or your intuition. I think it's probably sometimes pretty good. I just want you to make it explicit, that's all.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
Okay. So we didn't have time to get into quitting, which is your more recent book. Maybe we'll do a follow-up episode specifically thinking about quitting, but let me just ask-

Annie Duke (01:11:03):
It's my fault because my answers are long.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:05):
It's my fault.

Annie Duke (01:11:06):
I apologize to everybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
No apology is necessary. We'll have plenty of time in the future, hopefully. Well, let me just ask one question. I found this one quote from you where you said you should assume that if you're thinking about quitting, it's already probably past the time that you should have quit. Do you still believe that? Is that generally a good rule of thumb? And just any takeaway, tip, lesson on quitting as our one question on quitting?

Annie Duke (01:11:29):
So the data is pretty strong that by the time you quit, it's probably long after the [inaudible 01:11:37]. And it's really just because, look, when we start things, we're starting things under difficult circumstances, which come from the uncertainty of the decision to start something. So when we start something, luck is going to have an influence on the outcome, which obviously, we have no control over because luck isn't in our control. And then there's also hidden information. So what happens is that after the fact, we know that we're going to learn new information and it can make it very hard to start things because we want to be more sure than we actually need to be. It's why Bezos has the 70% role to try to roll people back and be willing to accept that uncertainty in the starting decision. Now the good news is that when you learn that new stuff and the new stuff that you learn is, "Ooh, if I had known this, I wouldn't have started it", you have the option to quit generally.

(01:12:28):
So that's the good news. The bad news is that the same difficulties that apply to the decision to start apply to the decision to stop. In other words, we're making that decision under uncertainty as well. So we're not going to know for sure whether it would've turned out well or poorly unless we continue to do the thing that we already started. And we don't like to walk away from things unless we know for sure. So as Richard Thaler put it, most people won't quit until it actually isn't a decision. In other words, the whole thing is blown up, the startup has no money, or you're up on Everest and the blizzard is literally upon you and you're stuck in it. Or I think as he said, until you've fallen in the crevasse already, then you'll make the decision to quit because then you know how it was really bad. So people generally, for example, don't quit their jobs until they feel they have no other choice or relationships or projects or products that they're developing, it all applies because we want to know for sure.

(01:13:35):
And then on top of that is the fact that there is this issue of sunk cost, which is when we walk away, we feel like we'll have wasted everything that we've already put into what we're doing. But of course, waste is a prospective problem, not a retrospective one, even if we treat it like a retrospective one because it's the prospective one. Well, if you wouldn't start this today, then that means that everything that you're putting into this going forward is the actual waste, right? But we do that all the time. We go forward with things that we ought not to be going forward with because we're trying to protect the resources that we've already sunk into it in the past. Then there's other issues that have to do with, for example, endowment, the ownership over the things that we've built. This is particularly bad in product because we're building things.

(01:14:18):
And once we build things, we own them. And once we own them, we don't want to give them up and we actually value them more highly than identical things that we don't own. And then there's issues of internal and external validity, which is really just a fancy way to say your identity. How do other people view you? How do you view yourself? Do you feel like you failed? And what that means is that by the time, there's so many biases against stopping that by the time you're actually even thinking about quitting, it's probably already past the time that you ought to have quit. But we'll still continue on until we know for sure we didn't have any choice because here's the thing. When you walk away from something and someone's like, "Hey, why'd you stop that?" And you're like, "Oh, I had no choice" and you tell them everything that went wrong and, nobody's going to question you.

(01:15:04):
They're going to be like, "Oh, well, it sounds like you put in your best effort." But if you walk away early, people are like, "What?" So just quickly, I'll tell you I think just one of the best stories of this that I've got in my pocket here. Let me pull it out before the end. So Stewart Butterfield creating a product called Glitch, and Glitch is a massive multiplayer online world-building cooperative game. Releases it, this is in the aughts, and it's like a huge hit with the critics. It's Monty Python meets Dr. Seuss, it's an incredible whatever. They're getting tons and tons of great word of mouth and PR not doing any paid marketing. They have incredible investors in Andreessen Horowitz and Accel, they have $6 million in the bank and they 5,000 have diehard users, meaning users who use the game who play over 20 hours a week.

(01:16:04):
The issue is that customer acquisition was a beast that for every one person who was playing over 20 hours a week, there were between 95 and 99 people who came for five minutes and left. So obviously, this is a customer acquisition problem, which everybody knows. So they make an agreement in 2012 that they're going to do paid marketing, which they do for six weeks. And during that six weeks, their acquisition of new users, it's growing like six to 7% week over week, which is amazing. And at the end of that six weeks, this is November of 2012, at the end of that six weeks, that Monday morning, Stewart Butterfield writes a note to his investors and co-founders and says, "I woke up this morning with the dead certainty that Glitch was over."

(01:16:58):
Now notice nobody would do this in this case, right? But this is what happened is that the issue is that you really have to see is this worthwhile or not? Would I start this today? That's a forecast of the future, right? And what he did was some back-of-the-envelope math, and he said, "Look, if we continue to acquire customers at the weight that we've been acquiring them at the cost that we've been acquiring them, it's going to be 31 weeks until we break even." But that's an absurd assumption because customer acquisition costs, it's going to go up. Cap has to rise because we're going to saturate the core gaming market, so it's got to rise. So what he realized at that point was that this was not a venture scale business, and he was in this for a venture scale business. So even though nobody else saw that he was supposed to shut it down, he saw he was supposed to shut it down.

(01:17:45):
And not only that, he saw that he was supposed to shut it down for his employees who were working for equity, and he had now realized that the equity wasn't worth their time and that it wasn't fair to them to keep going with it. So he shuts it down. Obviously, that feels... Who does that? Right? And he will actually tell you that he knows he should have shut it down before the marketing push, but he needed the marketing push to prove it to himself that he was seeing the future clearly. Now, the code to this story just quickly is two days later, he's like, "Well, I'm a startup guy. I want to start something", and he's got this internal communication tool that his team is using in order to develop this product that everybody loves. And he says, "Actually, they really like that. Maybe that should be the next product."

(01:18:29):
So he goes and talks to the investors, they roll their money over into that. And that thing, which had no name at the time, now gets a name which is searchable log of all company knowledge, which is Slack. And so I think this is the important thing to realize is that we get so focused on, "But what about everything that I've put into it?" When what we forget is that when you're doing something, there's not just the cost of doing something that's not worthwhile that's direct, but there's also the cost of not being able to devote your attention to other opportunities that might be available to you. And as smart as Stewart Butterfield is, he couldn't see Slack until he quit Glitch. And that is a true cost that he would've born of continuing with Glitch. If he had continued with Glitch, Slack would not be something that we're all using today.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):
That is an incredibly beautiful way to end our conversation. I feel like I have at least a billion more questions to ask you and on the other hand, I feel like we've also helped a lot of people make much better decisions through this chat so I'm really thankful that you made time for this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn about the stuff you're up to in case they want to work with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Annie Duke (01:19:43):
You can find me at annieduke.com if you're interested in working with me. I have a Substack, Thinking in Bets. Please go check that out. I teach a class on maven.com twice a year on effective decision-making. So if you're interested in that, you can go to Maven and check it out. My next cohort at the moment is in September, although I might do one in May. I'm not sure. But in terms of people can help me, I co-founded an organization called The Alliance for Decision Education. We're trying to bring the kinds of knowledge that we have about improving human decision-making in adults to K through 12 education to make the world a better place. So I would love it if people could go look at that. If you're interested in it, get the word out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Amazing. So we'll link to all those things in the show notes. Annie, again, thank you so much for being here.

Annie Duke (01:20:32):
Thank you. Thank you so much, this was so fun.

# Behind the scenes of Calendly’s rapid growth | Annie Pearl (CPO)

## Transcript

Annie Pearl (00:00:00):
Strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose. And so, a good product strategy is going to answer questions like what's your winning aspiration? But maybe more importantly, where are you going to play? What are the markets you're going to go after? What are the segments of those markets? What are the personas in the segments of those markets? And then, how are you going to win with a target audience?

Lenny (00:00:27):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Annie Pearl. Annie is currently chief product officer at Calendly. Before that, she was chief product officer at Glassdoor. And before, that she was director of product management at Fox. She's also a member of Skip, a community for chief product officers, and she's on the board of two different companies. 

(00:00:54):
In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including how Calendly builds product, how Calendly has grown, including the wild story of how they got their first 1,000 users, and also how they built a sales team on top of what historically has been a very product-led growth company. Annie also shares a ton of great advice on how to get into product management. I learned a ton from Annie and I know you'll too. Annie also shares a few killer tips for using Calendly, which I loved. And so, with all that, I bring you Annie Pearl through a short word from our wonderful sponsors. 

(00:01:25):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request. Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. 

(00:01:56):
For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, drive ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's readymade templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. 

(00:02:32):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the dock that brings it all together and how can I help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. And within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Koda.

(00:03:10):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Koda. Koda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Koda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of the special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at koda.io/lenny and get $1,000 start credit on your first statement. That's C-O-D-A.io/lenny, the signup and get a startup credit of $1,000, koda.io/lenny.

(00:03:50):
Annie, welcome to the podcast.

Annie Pearl (00:03:53):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Super excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:55):
I've been a big fan of yours from afar. We've crossed paths a little bit on Reforge, on Twitter, probably been at events that maybe we didn't know each other at yet. So, I'm really excited to finally be chatting, real life, in real time, at least.

Annie Pearl (00:04:09):
Me as well.

Lenny (00:04:09):
I've got a Calendly question to kick things off. It feels like with Calendly one of the most awkward elements of it is I have to put the burden on someone else to book at Calendly. So, I'm sending a link and I haven't figured out a good way to send it to someone without it coming across like a power move. So, my question to you is how do I send a Calendly to someone without it feeling bad?

Annie Pearl (00:04:31):
All right, well I love this question to kick us off. We actually have a whole blog post about this if you're curious to learn more.

Lenny (00:04:31):
Oh, okay.

Annie Pearl (00:04:37):
But I think that at a high level, I think I recommend first really just kind of opening the door for the person you're trying to schedule time with to share their availability first. So instead of just sending the link, I usually start the email with something like looking forward to connecting, feel free to share, sometimes you're available or if easier, you can choose to find time on my calendar using the Calendly link here. So, opening the door to let them choose before you offer up your Calendly link, I think is a little bit of a subtle way to let them take the lead if they want. 

(00:05:08):
And the second piece I would recommend too is once you opened that door, you can further reduce the effort on the recipient by adding times you're available directly in the email. So, when you go to share a Calendly link, there's an option to add times to email and you can then just paste those directly into the email you're creating, so that reduces yet another sort of point of friction to ask the user to click the link and get taken to Calendly. So, opening the door and then adding times to email are two things that I do to really make sure that it's not awkward and it doesn't put the burden on the other person.

Lenny (00:05:39):
That is awesome advice. That first one is what I ended up doing actually. That's really interesting where you don't send the link immediately. You first just ask, "Hey, send me your Calendly." And actually, I always say, "Send me your Calendly." I assume that's what they're using. That's kind of funny.

Annie Pearl (00:05:53):
Right.

Lenny (00:05:53):
I don't even know what else is out there.

Annie Pearl (00:05:54):
That's good. That's what we like to hear.

Lenny (00:05:56):
Yeah, absolutely. It's like its own word now. Okay, that was awesome. So, there's this already actionable advice for anyone listening. 

Annie Pearl (00:06:03):
Sweet. 

Lenny (00:06:04):
Transitioning a little bit to product, the main focus of chat, you transitioned into product from being a lawyer. You told me at one point that a lot of people ask you for advice about how to transition into product from other functions, especially non-technical functions as someone without a technical background. So, what advice do you give people when they ask you how to transition into a product role?

Annie Pearl (00:06:25):
I got what I'll call lucky, which is I kind of stumbled into product management after law school, joined the founding team of a startup and ended up doing product management there. But when I think about folks who are looking to get in their product management, I think there's really two paths. I think one is more formal in nature. There are associate product manager programs out there and many scaled companies, Google, Meta. All have APM programs that you can formally apply to. And actually, when we were at Box, much earlier stage company than either of those companies I just mentioned, we actually created an APM program to help grow our bench of more junior PM. So, I think you can actually find APM programs even at smaller, earlier stage companies than even kind of big tech. So that's one, it's just formal APM programs.

(00:07:07):
I think another "more formal" way to get into PM is really by just directly applying to a junior PM role where there's no expectation of any sort of experience. I've usually seen this work best when you're already working somewhere in some product adjacency. Maybe you're in customer support, implementation, or maybe you're a sales engineer. But you can look at the internal job board and find junior PM roles that are posted and that's one way to make the move. So that's kind of on the formal side like APM programs and just applying via internal job boards.

(00:07:38):
I think on the informal side, really two suggestions here. The first one is to seek out opportunities to shadow or partner closely with a product manager and maybe even offer to take on some work. So, some of the best PMs that I've brought over to product from other functions, they really start by expressing interest in product and then start partnering closely with the product manager and maybe even doing a little bit of product work before they make that transition.

(00:08:02):
And one tactical suggestion is there's oftentimes companies will have subject matter expert programs where they want to pair someone from a go-to-market function with a certain product squad or a certain product area. And so that's becoming a SME. It allows you to really get more involved and embedded into the product team. So, that's one suggestion. And then maybe last one is just the path I did, which is joining an early stage startup. There's really usually an expectation that everyone's going to get their hands dirty doing a lot of different things. And so, I think that's one way where you might have an opportunity to try product management if you end up joining an early stage company.

Lenny (00:08:38):
So, maybe it was four, maybe it was more paths that you described. Join APM program. What was the second one again?

Annie Pearl (00:08:45):
Internal job board apply, when you're in the company.

Lenny (00:08:48):
As just like a junior PM. Two is, find someone that mentors you and helps you start doing the role. And is that internal? Is that the internal transfer app?

Annie Pearl (00:08:58):
Yeah, exactly. 

Lenny (00:08:58):
Cool. 

Annie Pearl (00:08:59):
And then, another flavor of that is sometimes companies will have these SME programs.

Lenny (00:09:03):
What is a SME program?

Annie Pearl (00:09:05):
Subject matter expert. So, you'll say, "Hey, I want to make sure we have subject matter expert in our CS team on this area of the product." And they'll partner really closely with the product manager and designer within that area.

Lenny (00:09:16):
Got it. And then the fourth bucket is, join a startup, start doing PM work and then you end up being a PM. 

Annie Pearl (00:09:21):
You got it. 

Lenny (00:09:21):
Which of those four do you find most common? And would you push people in one direction or another?

Annie Pearl (00:09:26):
Yeah, I've brought a lot of folks over internally for the path of someone's really interested in product, they express they're interested, they want to help, they want to learn, they're eager, they're curious. And so, they make that really well known and they're even willing to do some work on the side to help out and really show and demonstrate the skills before they have the job. So, I've seen that one to actually probably bring the most folks over in my role in terms of being on the product leadership side.

Lenny (00:09:53):
On the APM program route, are there any APM programs you recommend? Because I'm sure people hear this and they're like, "Yeah, but I don't know where to apply. I don't know which ones are good." I don't know if you have a list, but just what comes to mind as APM programs to go pursue? 

Annie Pearl (00:10:05):
The folks who started it all was Google, with the Google APM program. And Meta obviously has a pretty strong robust APM program. But as I mentioned around Box, I think those are obviously very, very competitive and most people want to get into them. It may be better to try and find a company like Box or a company that's a bit earlier stage, not as scaled to think about looking at those APM programs. And I'm sure if you want to, go to glassdoor.com where I used to work at Glassdoor, so had to throw that in there. You could search for associate product manager and I think you'll find a whole host of open roles that you might be able to apply to. 

Lenny (00:10:39):
That is a cool tip. I haven't heard of that. Go to Glassdoor and search for APM. So, you search for companies that have an APM title.

Annie Pearl (00:10:45):
Yes. You could just use associate product manager and you'll see all the open jobs out there and then go apply to them.

Lenny (00:10:50):
That's cool. Okay, good tip. What I find, and you mentioned this the best, if you have the option is internal transfer. If you're just like another function, you find someone that can help you move into the role.

Annie Pearl (00:11:01):
You have the relationships, you can show your work really well. The other thing I would say is when I think about folks who have successfully transferred over, I think they tend to have a couple of characteristics. They're usually very curious, they tend to be really passionate about the product and solving customer problems. And sometimes, they've even tinkered with a side project as a way to hone their PM skills. So, I think as you're thinking about making that transition, those types of characteristics really showing eagerness and interest in the product itself and solving customer problems are also great ways to get noticed and increase your chances.

Lenny (00:11:36):
Why do you think it is that not more companies have an APM program? It feels like such a win for so many people. Why is it just so rare? 

Annie Pearl (00:11:42):
Yeah, I think when we built this at Box, so drawing on that experience, it was a lot of work. If you're going to do it, you want to do it really well and you want to create an environment where you can help the associate product managers be successful, the goal is to ultimately graduate everyone from the APM program into being a product manager. And so, I think it takes a lot of intentionality and for us, it took a lot of work. We had to make sure we had clarity around the interview process. We had to make sure we had clarity around expectations in the role. We wanted to have a training element. 

(00:12:16):
We wanted to make sure that, again, we're setting people up for success. So, I think companies have to be at a stage of scale where they can really invest and they have the excess capacity to build the program in a way. I think that's going to help make sure everyone who comes through it has a chance at really learning, growing and ultimately being successful.

Lenny (00:12:33):
That's the same thing we found at Airbnb. There's a PM that was so excited to make the APM program and it just never really happens. It just takes so much work. And to your point, you have to set up for success. You want to make sure there's clear paths and you upgrade to a regular PM and have the interview.

Annie Pearl (00:12:49):
And are we doing, is this really an APM program for internal folks? Is this external? Are we going to be really trying to promote this? So, I think there's a lot of ancillary activities around the actual program itself that have to be taken into consideration to make sure that it is actually very successful.

Lenny (00:13:06):
Yeah. Maybe a last point we should probably imagine you agree with is generally just hard to get into product management. That's like the default. There's just not that many roles at companies versus say, engineers or some other functions. 

Annie Pearl (00:13:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:13:17):
So, I think that's just like there are not that many roles. It's a difficult role to break into, but these are the ways you can do it if you actually want to. 

Annie Pearl (00:13:17):
That's right. Yep.

Lenny (00:13:27):
Okay. So, I want to transition a little bit to talking about Calendly. 

Annie Pearl (00:13:29):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:13:29):
There are two areas I want to go. One is just how do you build product at Calendly? What have you learned about product development and team building? And then two, talk about how Calendly grows and what you've learned about growing a product like Calendly. It's such an interesting product, especially from a growth perspective. So, to start on just how product is built at Calendly, just a little context. How many product managers are there and how many PMs are there? How many people total, roughly? Yeah, just to give us a little bit of [inaudible 00:13:57].

Annie Pearl (00:13:56):
Let's see, when I joined about two years ago, I think the company was about 150 people and I think we're about 600 now. And then the product team, there were about 15 product managers and designers when I joined again about two years ago, and I think we're around 60 this year.

Lenny (00:14:08):
Wow. So, 60 product managers.

Annie Pearl (00:14:14):
Product managers, designers, and a research team. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:16):
Got it. What about just PMs?

Annie Pearl (00:14:20):
PMs probably, my guess is 20. 

Lenny (00:14:23):
Cool.

Annie Pearl (00:14:24):
Twenty-ish. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:25):
Cool. And then, can you talk about how the product team is structured roughly? If you think about a tree, [inaudible 00:14:30] tree.

Annie Pearl (00:14:30):
Yeah. So, as I mentioned, we've got product managers, we have designers, we have a research team, and then product operations. And then, on my product leadership team, we have head of design, head of research, head of product operations. And then, within the product management team, I have leaders across core, across enterprise and platform.

Lenny (00:14:50):
Got it. So, you manage the design team and engineering team, you said?

Annie Pearl (00:14:54):
Not engineering. Design, product and research. Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:56):
Got it. Something that I find is one of the big differences between product orgs is design reporting up to a product leader versus not. What's the rationale there? And then has Calendly tried a different approach?

Annie Pearl (00:15:08):
Yeah. So, when I was at Glassdoor in the CPO role, I had the opportunity to lead design for the first time. So, coming into Calendly, I had led both product and design as well as research. And so, I think it made sense given I'd already done it once to keep that structure coming into Calendly. I think at the end of the day, the real benefit of the structure is really to say at the end, we want to be thinking about everything we're doing through the lens of the end-to-end user experience. And so, if we have product managers who are really prioritizing the problems we're going to go after, and we've got designers who are really trying to think about how do we bring solutions to life to solve those problems, having both of those functions roll into one person just really allows us to think more holistically around the end-to-end user experience.

(00:15:53):
So, certainly, it can work where you have product and design reporting into different leaders that ultimately report into the CEO, but when you get to this level of scale from just a pure people management, but also just the scale of the business, you know often see this consolidation where product and design start to roll into one leader. And at least in my experience, I think it can help ensure that all the different pieces of work are integrated well together and ultimately deliver a better experience for customers.

Lenny (00:16:23):
So, it sounds like before you joined it wasn't like that. And if that's true, was there something that improved with that shift?

Annie Pearl (00:16:29):
So, the structure was there that way. At that time, we didn't have a head of design, so we had a lot of really great individual contributors and who had been, many of whom had been with the company for quite some time and really contributed to the great user experience that existed in the product. But we didn't have a design leader. So, one of the first leadership hires I made was to bring in a head of design to really build out that function. And then, that head of design is a peer partnering with the different heads of products across the product management organization as well.

Lenny (00:16:59):
What about in terms of the structure, whatever you can share one level below, how do you structure teams? Is it around outcomes? Is it around features of the product? Is it around type of persona? How do you think about that? 

Annie Pearl (00:17:13):
Yeah, yeah. So, we have a core team who's really responsible for the core end to-end user experience. In many ways, they're both doing feature development and then they're also doing growth work. So, they're thinking about how do we build new features and functionalities to help our core personas, which is typically folks who are in sales, recruiting and customer success. So, anyone in an externally facing role, we're really trying to help them do their jobs better. So, the core team's thinking about features and functionalities to really help our core end user persona. And then growth work to think about the PLG funnel, everything from acquisition, activation, conversion, and retention. So, that's one group. 

(00:17:49):
And then, second group is our "enterprise group." And they're really thinking about two different personas. One is the IT admin, the person who needs to make sure that Calendly is secure and that they have all the reporting mechanisms to be able to manage their account and all the tools to manage users and groups at scale. And the second piece of that is also departmental leaders. So as Calendly selling into or being used by a sales organization, the head of sales is not the IT admin, but they are a Teams admin who needs to manage their organization within Calendly. So, the enterprise group really thinks both about the admin, but also sort of the departments and how do we better serve departments. 

(00:18:31):
And then lastly, we have a platform team who's really thinking about how do we embed Calendly into the business processes of the organizations that we support and that we provide our product into. And so, that's everything from partnerships and integrations to our APIs.

Lenny (00:18:46):
Interesting. So, it's like problem focused/persona focused. Who are you trying to sell it to?

Annie Pearl (00:18:54):
That's right, that's right. Yeah, trying to sell it to, and then the persona of who's going to be using the functionality. And then, really having those teams hone and own those personas as they're developing functionality within the product.

Lenny (00:19:07):
What's your take on OKRs? Do you all use OKRs in some form?

Annie Pearl (00:19:11):
Yes, we do. We use OKRs both at the company level. So, we have three main OKRs that we're focused on for this year, for example, across the whole company. And then we have department level OKRs, many of which are in support of the company level OKRs, but then there's some additional things that we'll be doing at the department level, for example, that aren't going to show up at the company level. So yeah, we use them both at the company as well as on the product side.

Lenny (00:19:34):
Is there anything you've learned about making OKRs work? People love them. People hate them. 

Annie Pearl (00:19:39):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:19:39):
Is there something you do to make OKRs work? Something you've changed, something you've learned over time in how to work with OKRs?

Annie Pearl (00:19:44):
Yeah. When I first joined, I'd say we didn't have this muscle well built out. We didn't really have a clear product strategy at the time or clear OKRs guiding the work. And so, there was a lot of great work happening, but it really was unclear how it all fit together or how we were going to measure success in that work. So that was a first phase. I think the second phase for us was we developed a product strategy. We then had product team OKRs that corresponded to that product strategy, but they were really contained to the product team and each department across the organization had their own kind of siloed OKRs. 

(00:20:20):
And then, phase three, where really, I'd say we headed into this year, we have a really clear set, as I mentioned, of company OKRs and then in these really tightly integrated plans across the company around how we're going to support the key results and ultimately deliver on the objectives. And this has been a really incredible transformation of dependency mapping, being able to make sure that we're pulling all the levers across the organization to drive our most important objective.

(00:20:47):
So, I think it's just the kind of maturing of the business from almost no OKRs to product team OKRs to now company OKRs in a really tight planning process to make sure there's a lot of integration across the company to support what we need to do as a business.

Lenny (00:21:01):
So, what I'm hearing is one of the biggest changes in learnings was to connect OKRs across from the top to the bottom, right?

Annie Pearl (00:21:08):
Absolutely. Absolutely.

Lenny (00:21:09):
Is there anything else that has made a big impact on your ability to build and ship and execute as a company in terms of changes you've made in terms of how the company and how the teams build?

Annie Pearl (00:21:20):
I think one of the biggest changes that we've made, when I first joined, again, we had a product that served a lot of horizontal users. We help solo users who are freelancers, consultants. We help sales teams, we help recruiting teams, we help customer success, we help folks in education. So, we had a very broad user base. And what that means is that product managers in particular are I think had a really hard time prioritizing. At any point in time, it was really difficult to say, should I do work on feature A or for feature B without that clarity? And so, I think one of the most impactful things we did pretty early on in my tenure here was to hone in on our overall product strategy, but a poor piece of that being what's the actual market we're going after? What are the segments of that market? Who are the personas within the segments of that market?

(00:22:09):
And so, we've made a pretty clear distinction now that while a lot of the feature work that we'll do to support our target personas of sales teams, customer success teams and recruiting teams will impact folks who are not in those personas. Those are the core ICPs that we're going after. And so, historically, that would've been always a sort of trade off decision and a question. And now I think we have a lot of rigor around who our target market and then persona we're going after. And so, teams can use that to prioritize and also just deliver better value for those users.

Lenny (00:22:45):
So, it sounds like the biggest unlock and one of the biggest unlocks for making the team more efficient, move faster, make decisions quicker, is narrowing in on exactly who you're going to be selling to.

Annie Pearl (00:22:55):
I think it's one of the harder things for companies to do. So, it sounds relatively easy, and I think most companies believe that they have clarity around this. But then when you go down into the weeds of asking someone who's product manager or a designer, I don't know that it's always as clear because there's always a bit of a hesitation to say no, right? And the idea of saying no is scary. When in reality, the ability to say no is going to allow you to make sure you're building something that's going to be amazing for the people that matter most and not something that's going to be average or okay for a lot of different people.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Was there anything that was really hard about actually executing that, convincing people we're going to narrow and not worry about these people and any lessons from going through that process? Because I imagine a lot of founders listening are like, "Oh, that sounds we should be doing this, but oh man, we're leaving all this money on the table, people are going to be pissed."

Annie Pearl (00:23:45):
Yeah, I think it's a pretty big cultural shift. So, some of this intersects with the shift from product led growth to adding in a sales motion. So, when I joined Calendly, all of our ARR came from our PLG channel. We didn't have a sales team, we just hired a CRO who was going to build out a sales team. And so, in that world, the way you think about product, the way you think about processes, even the people you have on the team are tailored to that business model. And then, as we sort of moved up market and have now explicitly started to go after teams of users and departments of users and organizations of larger scale, everything about people, process, and product all changes. 

(00:24:29):
I think I touched on culture because I think that's pervasive across the entire organization. The way that things get done has to be highly integrated versus can be a bit more siloed when you're just sort of the self-service PLG business that in many ways runs itself through the product being well optimized. So, there's a lot of process change that needs to happen, the type of people that you need to bring into the organization, that changes as you layer in the new selling motion. And then the product itself of course has to change. 

(00:24:56):
So, I guess let's just say the example of PLG and SLG or the direct selling motion is tied in to your question around what are the things that need to change in order to get clear on your target user? And I think it's highly cultural in nature across people, across process, and then obviously across the actual product itself.

Lenny (00:25:15):
I have a whole bunch of questions about how Calendly grows and maybe we just get into some of the stuff because I imagine a lot of people are interested. First, let me ask this. I imagine Calendly mostly grows through, I sign up for Calendly, they send it to everyone when I book a meeting and they're like, "Oh, what is this?" And they're like, "Oh, cool, I'm going to use this." And then they start using, it spreads, and then sales eventually finds people at a company that are using it a lot and tries to get the whole company in it. Is that roughly right?

Annie Pearl (00:25:39):
Yeah. Seventy percent of our signups come through that viral loop that you referred to. And then, of those signups, then they're usually solo users and then they start to invite team members in and then the team starts using Calendly and then usually the head of that team either inbounds to us or we have some sort of PQL data to know we should go after that team lead to try and have a conversation around expanding Calendly across their entire organization.

Lenny (00:26:05):
And PQL, product qualified lead, right?

Annie Pearl (00:26:08):
You got it. Yep.

Lenny (00:26:08):
Wow, what a loop. What a magical way to grow that everybody wishes they could have.

Annie Pearl (00:26:14):
It's pretty incredible, I will say.

Lenny (00:26:16):
Oh man. Okay, so going back to the question. When did Calendly hire their first salesperson, like any learnings about just how to start down that road once you start a product?

Annie Pearl (00:26:25):
Yeah. As I mentioned, when I joined two years ago, we just hired our first CRO and the PLG business really represented 99% of our ARR. And then, over the last two years, we've scaled the sales team in our SLG motion. Our sales led growth motion now represents about 20% of our ARR and it's actually the fastest growing segment of the business. I think there's probably two things I would touch on in terms of early sales hires. I think the first is, when you're making that transition from PLG to adding in the sales led motion, because you're starting from PLG, it's tends to be much more inbound in nature. You've got these sales reps who are working leads who have usually proactively reached out interested or as we mentioned PQLs. They have data to tell them that this is someone who has usage within their team, and therefore, we should reach out. 

(00:27:17):
And so, that's a very different profile of a sales team member than you might need after you need to pursue more of a heavy outbound motion, more of a hunter profile than a grower profile. So, I think that's the first piece is just make sure you think about the motion when you're moving towards a sales led model. In those early days, it's more inbound in nature, and so the type of sales reps you might need are not necessarily going to be outbound, heavy kind of hunting sales reps.

Lenny (00:27:46):
Just one quick question on that actually, because that's really interesting. I don't know how involved you are in hiring these folks, but is it like, look at their background and they've worked at a company like that? Or is it personality type? Is there anything to look for specifically there?

Annie Pearl (00:27:58):
Yeah, I think it is mostly background and the type of selling that they've done previously more so than personality type. But I think the second piece, that's important too, and I'll answer your question on that one too, which is the target buyer. So, when you transition from PLG to sales led or adding this direct sales motion, the buyer is usually just the department head. It's the head of sales, it's the head of rev ops, it's the head of recruiting and it's not a senior person in IT or the CIO. And so, selling into this audience is different than selling into IT.

(00:28:32):
And so, I think you have to be sure again that you have the right fit of sales folks with the target buyer in those early days. And so, to your question around what's that mean? You wouldn't necessarily want to bring on a bunch of sales folks who are at Oracle who are heavy in selling into CIOs in the early days because that's just not who you're the buyer's going to be. I mean, think we will graduate there eventually, but it's probably going to start from team lead to someone in IT to eventually a CIO led purchase, but that's certainly several years away. And so, making sure that the profile, the folks you're bringing on early match that target buyer in addition to match the motion around how you're going to be acquiring customers.

Lenny (00:29:15):
And to see that, is it similar? You look at the companies they worked at, it's like PLG-ish companies.

Annie Pearl (00:29:20):
Definitely. Yeah, exactly. Yep. Yep. 

Lenny (00:29:23):
Okay. So, along the same lines, as a product leader working with a strong and large sales team, anything you've learned about just how to build that relationship and build a product org that works really closely and well with a sales org?

Annie Pearl (00:29:37):
The first piece that really starts with is customer empathy. And at the end of the day, seeing the sales team and the go-to-market team as this really great asset that can help you as a product manager get closer to the customer. So, I've certainly seen organizations or been in organizations where the product team doesn't necessarily want to be bothered by sales, but I sort of flip that on the head and say sales and sort of the go-to-market teams in general could be your biggest asset to helping you get your job done well.

(00:30:07):
When I was at Box, I was a product manager on the enterprise team and I spent a ton of time in the field and I don't know how I would possibly know how to have what to have built or how to build it to solve the needs of our customers if I didn't have that close relationship with the sales team and be able to lean on them because they're talking to, 10X of them were customers that I was able to ever talk to within any given week, really lean on them to be the voice of the customer to help me make the best product decisions that I could.

Lenny (00:30:35):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. 

(00:31:00):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC two, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:31:52):
I'm curious how you prioritize work that you could be doing as a product team. There are salespeople coming at you, there's issues you're probably having, there are some founders wanting to ask you for few stuffs, just like a classic product management question. But I'm curious if you found any frameworks or approaches for just deciding what to actually build of all the things you're hearing.

Annie Pearl (00:32:09):
The core challenge of being a product manager, right?

Lenny (00:32:12):
Just to add that I feel like the core job of PM is just tell people what's next, what's the next thing.

Annie Pearl (00:32:16):
That's right, and hopefully, you have a good reasoning as to why that thing, next is going to have the biggest impact, which is really where I start. I think it really starts with a clear product strategy that will dictate a few things. And I like this framework that's taken from a book called Playing to Win and it talks about how strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose. And so, a good product strategy is going to answer questions like, what's your sort of winning aspiration, but maybe more importantly, where are you going to play? What are the markets you're going to go after? What are the segments of those markets? What are the personas in the segments of those markets? And then, how are you going to win with a target audience?

(00:32:59):
And so, what I think this framework does kind of dovetails back to what I was saying before around prioritization is it forces you to create clarity around where you're going to play and where you're not going to play. And so, this really helps the product team hone in on delivering value for a very clear set of people versus trying to build something for everyone. And so, once you've established what that strategy is or what the playing field you're going to go after, then I think you can divide up your product work and service of that strategy. 

(00:33:28):
So, I'll give you an example. At Calendly, we have the sort of vision, our winning aspiration to become the best place to schedule, prepare for and follow up on your external meetings. And then, we've articulated three horizons around how we're going to get there. Now, the year one that I was here, the percentage of resources we spent on that first horizon and the second horizon was about a 70/30 split and we put 0% of our resources on horizon three. That was too far out in the future and we didn't want to make any investments there quite yet, but we knew where we were going.

(00:34:00):
In year two, it shifted. We went to a 50/50 split between horizon one and horizon two, but still, no explicit investments in Horizon three. And then, as we're entering to year three now, we've significantly scaled back the investment in horizon one, that's about 30% and then we've got 60% in horizon two and call it 10 in horizon three. So, I think just to close on the question of prioritization, I think it starts with a really clear product strategy which defines where you're going to play and how you're going to win. And then, the work and the percentage of allocation just should feed right into that product strategy and how you're doing against where you need to be in order to achieve ultimately your winning aspiration.

Lenny (00:34:38):
I don't know how much you could share here, but is there a feature that is people keep asking for it and it hasn't been built because of the strategy, the long-term vision, something that's like, "Nope, it doesn't fit. We're not going to do this."

Annie Pearl (00:34:50):
Yeah, I think the best example I can give is there's lots of small businesses and solopreneurs who would love us to have a Venmo integration. We have a PayPal integration. But our target market that we're really trying to go after as our primary persona are as I've mentioned, these sort of core ICPs within organizations. So, sales teams, recruiting teams, customer success teams. And so, it doesn't make sense within those personas to pursue something like a Venmo integration. Now, there's a lot of things we'll build for those personas that are going to help the small business, the solopreneur, the freelancer, but that specific feature is something that would be clearly deprioritized given the current strategy.

Lenny (00:35:29):
That's an awesome example. I want to get back to the growth stuff, but before I do that, we're kind of on this topic of planning and a cares and prioritization. I'd love to know just how you do planning at Calendly? How far out do you plan in detail? How far do you have roadmaps? How often do you plan? Anything you can share there?

Annie Pearl (00:35:45):
This starts again, I sound like a broken record, but with this really clear strategy around where we're going over the next couple of years and then we take that and we break that down into what are the most important things we need to do as a company this year in order to be able to make the right progress against that strategy. So, we have the company level OKRs and I mentioned that we have about three of those this year. And then, those KRs within the company, OKRs are measured annually, but we have milestones across a quarterly basis so we can measure progress more frequently than obviously on the annual or semi-annual basis.

(00:36:19):
So, I think that's kind of at the high level. And then, obviously our product roadmaps are going to be in support of those key results that we needed to deliver to the business over the course of the year, but then broken down on a quarterly basis.

(00:36:30):
I think one thing I'll just touch on real fast on is estimations and dates. Something we've done over the last year is really kind of moved to a model of talking about dates and promising and committing to dates that are within our control. And so, if you think about the product development life cycle, we can commit to a discovery effort of doing research around a certain problem space and we can have a general sense of when we know that effort's going to conclude. We don't know if we're going to actually end up going, and based on the results whether we're going to actually move forward with investing in that area, but that's a body of work we can commit to. 

(00:37:05):
From there, we then move into, "Okay, if this is something a problem space we want to go after, we're going to go work on a couple different solutions and we're going to go do some user testing and we're going to land on a solution," and that's another sort of phase we can commit to. Then, once we actually have that completed and we actually know not just the problem but the solution, we can do estimation planning and actually have a date for delivery from an engineering perspective. And so, we've gotten a lot better at making the commitments around the work that's right in front of us versus making a commitment around a project six months out when we haven't even done enough discovery, enough design and ideation to have a real clear understanding of estimation.

Lenny (00:37:43):
That is really cool. Do you have terms for these phases, like these phases you have to get through these kinds of gates? Yeah, how do you describe that?

Annie Pearl (00:37:50):
Yeah, so the first phase we just call generally discovery. The second phase, we call solutioning. The third phase, build. And then, the fourth phase is launch, measure and iterate. 

Lenny (00:37:50):
Cool. 

Annie Pearl (00:38:01):
And then, we've designed the product development lifecycle around that framework.

Lenny (00:38:04):
So, discovery for example, is that a roadmap item for a quarter and that's like what you've committed to? And if that goes well, the next quarter has the next step.

Annie Pearl (00:38:12):
Yeah, exactly. You got it.

Lenny (00:38:14):
Sweet. Okay. In terms of the strategy artifacts, how does that look or do you have a Google Doc with a template that you all use? What does that look like? What's interesting about people not working at a company or working at just one company is they only have, strategy documents are really hard to see and see examples of. So, I'm always curious what these looks like. So, whatever you can share about what they look like and where you put them and how long and that kind of thing.

Annie Pearl (00:38:40):
We have a couple of different layers of this. I think the first is this high-level three-year strategy and this is actually called at the company level. So, if the doc, it also has slides that have been presented many times to the company when we're in the process of making sure that, that is part of new hire orientation so that everyone should understand where are we going over the next three years and then therefore how does this year's objectives fit into that. So, I think that's at that level. 

(00:39:07):
And then, from there, we've got our product team OKRs. These generally start by docs and we write them in docs. So, they usually get translated into slides at some point for presentation purposes to the company and those are stored centrally in a location and then you get down to the feature level or the project level. And we have different kind of templates for the teams to use based on the type of work that they're going to be doing. And we're a pretty heavy Confluence culture, so we tend to use Confluence as one of the tools for housing and storing information around the work that's being done.

Lenny (00:39:39):
Cool. So, maybe on that topic, what else is in the stack of Calendly product team tools?

Annie Pearl (00:39:44):
We talked about roadmap planning, some combination of starts with docs, there's mural boards involved. Usually, it ends in slides. Then actually roadmap tracking, we use Aha and we use Airtable collaboration/communication. We use Slack, we use Loom, bug management, we use Jira. I'm trying to think of, is there any other?

Lenny (00:39:44):
Confluence, you mentioned.

Annie Pearl (00:40:05):
Confluence. Yep. Confluence is what we use quite a bit. Pando, we use quite a bit of Pando to help educate users within the product when we're launching new features. Yeah, I think that's the main stack.

Lenny (00:40:16):
And docs is Google Docs and slides is Google Slides.

Annie Pearl (00:40:19):
You got it. Yep. 

Lenny (00:40:20):
Sweet. 

Annie Pearl (00:40:21):
That's right. 

Lenny (00:40:21):
Okay. I'm going to bounce around and go back to growth questions and then I have a couple more product team questions. How did Calendly get their first thousand users? 

Annie Pearl (00:40:30):
A great question and I had to fact check it with my CEO earlier this morning, but there's actually a few really interesting things about this story and a few things that Tope did in the early days to get 2,000 users. So, for those who aren't familiar Tope, our CEO and founder started his career in sales and he spent lots of years in sales. And so, he was very used to the challenges of trying to organize external meetings with prospective customers. So, he knew the problem space really, really well. And he had evaluated all the scheduling solutions that were on the market and came to conclusion that there really weren't any great products out there and especially there weren't any great products for the recipient of the actual booking service. And so, I think he saw this as an opportunity for disruption. So, he raided his 401k, he took out all his savings. He didn't make raise any money. 

Lenny (00:41:23):
That's a lot of penalties, taking out money at that point. 

Annie Pearl (00:41:23):
Sort of. That's a very good point. I've never asked him about that. And he hired an outside development firm actually in out of the Ukraine to build the first version of Calendly. So, that's the background on Calendly. Why it's important is that the first 10 users were actually customer success agents at a company in the education space that contracted with the same firm that Tope was using to build Calendly. So, he really found his first set of users through the firm that he was using to build the product. 

(00:41:51):
And then, those CSMs or customer success managers were actually using Calendly to schedule calls with parents in K through 12 education. And so, then those parents started using Calendly for their own parent-teacher conference scheduling. And then from there, the school started using it and then all the parents within the school started using it for lots of other use cases and it grew organically from there. So that was one piece.

(00:42:17):
I think the other piece that's really important is that he started off by just having a free tier. The entire product was free. Some of this came from honestly not being able to actually build the billing infrastructure that would be required to actually charge. So, it came a little bit out of necessity, but it was also free. So not only was it a better product than the alternatives out there, but it was also free. So, the combination of the viral loop and coming in through getting those first 10 users as part of the firm he was using and then the free aspect or I think what led to the first 2,000, and then 10,000, and millions of users from there.

Lenny (00:42:52):
That is crazy. I have never heard a story like that where the team that is building your product ends up being the source of initial growth.

Annie Pearl (00:42:58):
I know, pretty crazy.

Lenny (00:43:00):
Oh my God. So many nice things happening in this history of Calendly.

Annie Pearl (00:43:03):
I know.

Lenny (00:43:03):
And wow, in Ukraine. So, I'm actually from Ukraine.

Annie Pearl (00:43:08):
Oh nice. That's awesome.

Lenny (00:43:08):
That's pretty cool.

Annie Pearl (00:43:09):
Yeah, they're great. [inaudible 00:43:11].

Lenny (00:43:11):
Yeah, and it's also interesting that it's rare that you hear a successful business starts with contractor engineers. I think OICs are like, "Do not do that." So that's a cool counter example of it can actually work out, especially if they're your first users and spread it to others. 

Annie Pearl (00:43:27):
And we still work with them. They're fantastic and they have incredible engineers, so they're still part of our culture, which is great.

Lenny (00:43:32):
So, Calendly got big in Ukraine, it sounds like initially.

Annie Pearl (00:43:35):
There you go. There you go.

Lenny (00:43:37):
What's something that would surprise people in terms of how Calendly grows today or grew through its history?

Annie Pearl (00:43:43):
Most people probably think about Calendly as the scheduling link and really for individual users to reduce the back and forth of email and scheduling. So, they think of that one-on-one use case and I think people would be surprised to learn that our team's business, so multiple users in an organization who want to collaboratively schedule together is growing much faster than our solo user business. And that's really where the future of where we think growth will come from is supporting these teams of users who are in externally facing roles and selling into departments and supporting multi-departmental deployments of Calendly across an entire organization. 

(00:44:17):
So, I think it's still really well known as this solo user tool to eliminate the back and forth of email, but the growth of what we're seeing and where we think it's going to go is actually more teams of users and departments of users and then multiple departments in an organization.

Lenny (00:44:32):
It's interesting when you hear the story of Calendly that just has so many good things happening, basically for free, it's just grows so well. I think people don't realize you eventually will, that'll slow down, it'll taper off eventually. You'll need to drive growth very actively in these new ways that you're describing. And I think people don't often realize that they just wanted to find something that was viral and then things are going to go great, but it tapers off.

Annie Pearl (00:44:54):
Yeah. I mean, there's only so many people who, solo users who are going to pull out a credit card. And I think once you also get to hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue scale, just the law of large numbers, it means that growth will slow. And so, you have to figure out where's that next growth curve going to come from. I think the beauty of Calendly is that while we certainly have built features and functionality to support teams and departments, we got pulled there. It wasn't one of those things where we sort of said, "We need to find our next growth lever. Let's go build X." Our customers really pulled us there by the way that they were using the product. 

(00:45:30):
And so again, a very fortunate position to be in, but when you can see in the data and see how customers are using it, that they want to be working on scheduling with their teams, that was our early sign, that's where the business was going to go in the future.

Lenny (00:45:46):
I don't think I mentioned this, I'm paying user of Calendly. It's what I use for booking these podcast episodes.

Annie Pearl (00:45:50):
All right.

Lenny (00:45:50):
You got me. I think I started when it was totally free and I was like, "How will they ever make money?" This is too much power. 

Annie Pearl (00:45:56):
And then, now, you learned that it was free almost by accident.

Lenny (00:46:02):
Yep. I was like, "Yeah, please take my money. This makes my life easier." What are some fun or unique traditions and cultural kind of components of the Calendly product team?

Annie Pearl (00:46:12):
A couple of fun ones I thought we could talk about. One, we have a meeting called OPA, which stands for opportunity/problem, assessment. And so, what this is, it's a meeting where basically PMs, I don't even go to it's a meeting for PMs to really debate and discuss with each other and spar around either areas and problems that they want to go investigate or after they've gotten data back or research back from evaluating an opportunity, deciding whether we actually want to move forward and go try to develop a solution. So, it's really in the product development lifecycle of letting product managers really get into a room with each other on a frequent basis and just think through things, debate, discuss. And I know that they all get a lot of value out of that.

Lenny (00:46:59):
It reminds me of something just like a bad version of that. I had a friend who was a PM at Zynga and he said there's a meeting where PMs present their plans to all the other PM. It was like you're in a shark tank where everyone's coming to destroy you. They just point out all the problems. That's all it ever is in this.

Annie Pearl (00:47:15):
I would say on this one, it's the opposite where I feel like everyone really needs the meeting. They're like, "Ugh, I really need to take this to OPA because I need to, I'm working through these problems and I really want to bounce it off of other people." So, I could imagine a world where it would be that. Actually, part of the reason I don't go to the meeting is that I really want everyone to be able to be open and transparent and provide feedback and not feel like there's any judgment from me or any needing to act a certain way because I'm in the room. So, that's sort of why I intentionally don't go. 

(00:47:44):
Another fun one we do is something we call competitive work gaming. So, on some sort of time interval, sometimes it's been quarterly, we'll have assigned people into groups for the quarter to own a competitor. And their job is to essentially spend a lot of time immersing themselves into the product of the competitor, really trying to think through the lens of, do a SWAT analysis, really try to think through the lens of where's this competitor going and how Calendly only think about that and as it relates to our strategy. 

(00:48:12):
And so, we spent a quarter doing that and then we have the competitive war gaming day where every team comes and presents and there's prizes and it's a lot of fun, but it's a really great way to stay on top of what's happening across the market without requiring every product manager designer to be deep in the weeds, there are a lot of different competitors. We can bring all of that knowledge together through what we call competitive work gaming. 

Lenny (00:48:34):
That is cool. It's really impressive how you do these exercises and they seem really positive and friendly and constructive. It sounds like there is a pretty unique culture at Calendly. I'm curious if there's anything else that's core to the values or the way that you think about the principles of building product at Calendly.

Annie Pearl (00:48:51):
What I touched on earlier is really core to how we build product, which is honing in on this target user and honing in on our target market. I do think it's quite rare. I think in most organizations that I've seen, I think there's a desire to do that. But I think, again, when it push comes to shove, it's really hard for executives to make decisions that say no to things. One of Calendly's actually core principles is focus wisely. It's pretty deeply embedded into our culture. And so, I think one of the reasons that I've been successful in being able to create the clarity around who the target personas are is because I think it's embedded into the culture of Calendly to focus wisely. 

(00:49:29):
So, I don't know that it'll work in every organization. I think many organizations really struggle to say no, and they're always adding more onto the plate versus taking off. But I do think from an ethos perspective, there is something around focusing and the ability to focus to therefore deliver the highest quality of product that you can to your target customers. That is unique and I think it starts with some of the broader cultural paradigms that exist at the company and then we've now embedded that into the way we think about how we build product.

Lenny (00:49:59):
Is there anything else you do to instill that? It sounds like it's a core value. Do you put posters around the office? So how else do you keep people focused? 

Annie Pearl (00:50:06):
We're a fully remote company. So, now you've got my brain going on. Are there some sort of virtual sticky notes that you could get people to put onto their laptops to remind them?

Lenny (00:50:15):
Backgrounds to show us [inaudible 00:50:16]. 

Annie Pearl (00:50:15):
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's embedded into a lot of the documentation. So, it's embedded into the templates that I talked about in terms of, everything from sort of the way we structure that OPA, document that folks are going to be working on and debating too when they go to create the actual sort of PRD. When teams come in to present as part of our product reviews, we have a template that keeps reinforcing who's the target customer, who's the target user within that customer base, what are their needs and then how are we going to solve their needs better than any alternative that there is on the market. So, I think there's lots of different reinforcing mechanisms to that focus.

Lenny (00:50:57):
I feel like sometimes things like that come from a big problem the company had and then you index weigh the other side, focus, here's the four people we all build for. It becomes instilled in the culture.

Annie Pearl (00:51:08):
And I think you're right. I mean, because Calendly started as such a horizontal product, which was amazing because that's how it grew so virally and so it had the entry, the wedge into scheduling and how our first horizon and becoming the best horizontal scheduling automation platform was because we had that horizontal focus. And so, it was a blessing. But as we think about transitioning to horizon two, which is really about deepening our support for these teams and departmental users as well as verticals, that's I think the inflection point where we said, in order to shift us from horizon one to horizon two, we need to be making some real trade off decisions and we need to create this focus so that we can actually allow teams to go do that. 

(00:51:52):
So, I think it's a really good point. We sort of had to create clarity around focus because we were trying to make a shift from broad horizontal platform serving lots of users to a deeper investment into specific users and specific teams of users within departments.

Lenny (00:52:07):
Before Calendly, you were at Box. Before that, you were at Glassdoor. I'm going to ask two different questions. You could pick which direction you want to go. What would you say are the biggest differences culturally between these three? If you had to bucket, here's how I'd describe Glassdoor, Box, Calendly. Or what did you take from those two places that you bring with you to Calendly and future opportunities?

Annie Pearl (00:52:27):
I love this question. So, they're all different, which is why I just feel so fortunate to have had experiences that were all quite different. So, starting with Box, maybe I'll take your second question. Box, when I joined, we were in the process of moving up market and trying to capture as much enterprise market share as possible, and I was on the enterprise product management team. So, I spent a lot of time, as I mentioned earlier, talking to customers. And in my first year in particular trying to ramp on the business. And I'd say my biggest learning during that time was around how to ask the right questions to really understand the why behind what a customer was asking for and then figuring out how to build a solution to their problem that would also meet the needs of a broader swath of customers.

(00:53:07):
It became very clear early to me if I would just go build what customer A wanted and what customer B wanted and the customer C wanted, not only would that be wasted effort to do it three times, but more importantly, what they wanted me to go build was going to have a negative impact on the end user experience. And preserving that end user experience was so critical. So, learning how to ask the right questions to understand the actual problem and then build the solution that's going to be most scalable to that problem set across lots of customers was probably my biggest learning from Box.

(00:53:37):
Moving to Glassdoor, totally different business model. Glassdoor is actually really more of a consumer business and 60 million unique users go to Glassdoor every month and it's a marketplace between job seekers and employers and it's highly, highly dependent on the consumer engagement, growing traffic, getting that traffic to come and engage and apply to jobs. And so, during my time as CPO there, I was responsible now for both sides of that marketplace, the consumer business and the B2B. And so, I learned all about how do you build PR consumer products, how do you think about optimization of a funnel? How do you think about building up a growth team and growth as a discipline? How do you use data and AB testing to make decisions? 

(00:54:17):
So, I think that kind of consumer mentality and how you approach product, I then have brought with me to Calendly, which is really a blend of both, right? Calendly is first, as we've talked about a PLG business and it looks a lot more like a consumer business like Glassdoor. And then, it's got this direct selling business that looks a lot more like Box's enterprise business. So, I think I've been able to take kind of lessons learned from both Box and Glassdoor and apply them together to Calendly.

Lenny (00:54:43):
What a cool set of experiences. I'm trying to imagine you using all three in the same day. Sending a Calendly, storing your files in a Box and looking at reviews...

Annie Pearl (00:54:53):
And recruiting.

Lenny (00:54:54):
And recruiting. Yeah, yeah. Not looking for anything new. Okay. Final question. You are part of something called the Skip community, which I believe Nikhyl and a few people run. And so, I'd love to just hear a little bit about that and maybe how folks can join if they might be a fit.

Annie Pearl (00:55:08):
Yeah, as you mentioned about two years ago, Nikhyl, who was the former CPO of Credit Karma and is now a VP of product at Meta, got a small group of CPOs together who were all going through similar phases of companies' growth, late stage growth companies, and we all were facing the same challenges in our roles. And he formalized this community as a way to help us gather advice from one another, talk through how to manage challenges we're facing and just make us more successful in the roles. And we always joke, we're like the support group. 

(00:55:37):
We meet on Sundays and it has been incredibly valuable as I've sort of gone through the last couple of years in my role at Calendly. Since then, we've grown the group to about 23 heads of products and CPOs and expanded the charter a bit, which I think is interesting to help product leaders not just be successful in their current role, but also how to think about setting them up for success in the role after this.

(00:55:59):
And so, we're experimenting with a couple of different interesting ways to help product leaders grow. One of them is we're actually partnering with some companies right now to experiment with how can we help them as they're looking to make their first head of product hire or their first C O hire really hone in on what they're looking for and partnering with the talent partners we know to really help try to increase the success that they find the right candidates. That's something interesting we're doing. 

(00:56:23):
We also recently launched a podcast covering some topics like, how do you manage the next job search, how do you avoid burnout, breaking down things like equity, and other kind of timely topics. And then also, we just have an active Discord server where we've got all sorts of channels from topics, how to manage the CEO/CPO partnership, compensation, even sharing planning, even sharing some advising opportunities or other CPO roles that kind of come across our radar. 

(00:56:53):
So, it's been a really, really cool kind of experiment to see how the power of the community. And I know Lenny, you do a ton of stuff around community, how that has helped all of us. I think it's just more effective in our roles and feel like we have a group of people who are behind us supporting us during what is a very hard role.

Lenny (00:57:11):
I love this. I imagine when people look at a CPO, they imagine they just know everything already. They have a bunch of friends in the same role, but I think in reality, it's a lonely role a lot of times. And so, I could see the power of something like this just to help people understand who'd be a good fit for this, how do they go find it and yeah, it's like the [inaudible 00:57:33].

Annie Pearl (00:57:33):
The best thing to do is just follow the Skip community on LinkedIn. And then, we're targeting head of products, call it series B, C and beyond, up to late stage growth companies and up to CPOs. So, I'd say start by following the Skip community and if you see folks in there who are in the group, reach out to them to get a sense of what it's like and what it would be like to join.

Lenny (00:57:57):
And then, it sounds like if you're a company hiring a CPO, maybe reach out too.

Annie Pearl (00:58:00):
Yeah, that'd be great. That'd be great. Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:03):
Okay. And they do that by going to LinkedIn also and looking for the Skip community?

Annie Pearl (00:58:06):
Yeah, that'd be great.

Lenny (00:58:07):
Okay, cool. We'll put all the links in the show notes as well. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Annie Pearl (00:58:15):
Let's do it.

Lenny (00:58:17):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Annie Pearl (00:58:20):
Playing to Win, so, I reference that one earlier, Good to Great, and Hooked.

Lenny (00:58:25):
Awesome. What's a favorite other podcast that you enjoy other than maybe this podcast?

Annie Pearl (00:58:30):
I think I got introduced to you by Harry from the 20VC, I think. But if not, either way, I'll cross promote his podcast, which is a great one.

Lenny (00:58:39):
Yeah, Harry's responsible for this podcast. I was on his podcast and he's like, "Lenny, you should be [inaudible 00:58:43]".

Annie Pearl (00:58:43):
You got to do it.

Lenny (00:58:46):
He's the godfather of this podcast. 

Annie Pearl (00:58:48):
He is. That's great. 

Lenny (00:58:49):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show? And you cannot say White Lotus.

Annie Pearl (00:58:53):
I have two young kids. So, whether I like it or not, Sing 2. It's a great movie, especially if you have young children.

Lenny (00:59:00):
Sing 2. So, it's like the second of Sing?

Annie Pearl (00:59:03):
It is. It is. Distinct from Sing 1. Sing 2 is better.

Lenny (00:59:07):
It's better. Okay, cool. I haven't seen it.

Annie Pearl (00:59:10):
I would hope you haven't.

Lenny (00:59:11):
Okay, cool. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people you interview.

Annie Pearl (00:59:15):
Talk me through your biggest product flop. What happened and what did you do about it?

Lenny (00:59:21):
What do you look for in an answer? What's a sign of something good in their answer?

Annie Pearl (00:59:24):
People being brutally honest around how bad it was and why it failed. The rest of the interview, they're trying to tell you all the wonderful things they did and all the accomplishments they had. And so, I think the rawer the answer in terms of how bad it was and why, the better.

Lenny (00:59:38):
Awesome. Next question. I think, you might have answered, what are top five SaaS products you use day-to-day, either at work or home, whatever?

Annie Pearl (00:59:46):
Slack, Miro, Loom, Pendo, and Confluence.

Lenny (00:59:51):
Awesome. And these are actually, unlike other people's answers, so that's really interesting. Kind of a unique stack you got there. 

Annie Pearl (00:59:57):
I love it.

Lenny (00:59:58):
Final question. What's your best Calendly Pro tip?

Annie Pearl (01:00:01):
Yeah, so we just launched a new feature that I'm loving personally called Customized Once and Share. So, this really allows you to make changes on the fly to an event type and tweak things like title or duration or override a date based on the person you're actually sending it to without having to go create a brand new event type just to make one small change based on the recipient. So, it's that one-off use case where you need to make a little bit of a change on the fly depending on who you're sending it to, but you don't want to go through the effort of creating a brand-new event type. So, I'm loving it and you should check it out. 

Lenny (01:00:34):
That is awesome. I need that. I find that I need to block dates out and change times and I just like go do that on my calendar, in my Calendly.

Annie Pearl (01:00:42):
There you go there. 

Lenny (01:00:43):
All right. Annie, this was amazing. We learned a ton about Calendly growth product building. Two final questions. Where can people find you online if they want to learn more and reach out, maybe ask some questions. And two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Annie Pearl (01:00:56):
Finding me, best place online is LinkedIn. And then, in terms of being helpful to me, one we're hiring at Calendly. So, explore open roles on the product team at Calendly if you're interested. Share any feedback for me on this episode@a.pearl@calendly.com. And then, as we talked about, would love to have you follow the Skip community on LinkedIn as well.

Lenny (01:01:15):
Awesome. We'll have all those links in the show notes. Annie, thank you again for being here.

Annie Pearl (01:01:20):
Thank you so much, Lenny.

# Building Lovable: $10M ARR in 60 days with 15 people | Anton Osika (CEO and co-founder)

## Transcript

Anton Osika (00:00:00):
... Lovable is your personal AI software engineer. You describe an idea and then you get a fully working product. The reason is to enable those who have had such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their dreams into reality.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
You guys hit 4 million ARR in the first four weeks. You hit 10 million ARR in the first two months with just 15 people. You're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe. How did you decide on Lovable is the name. It's so sweet.

Anton Osika (00:00:31):
The best word for a great product is that it's lovable. A lot of jargon that I like to use to emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum lovable product and then building a lovable product and then building an absolutely lovable product. So I took that jargon with me in the company name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
People would wonder just what jobs will be more important, what skills will be less important?

Anton Osika (00:00:51):
Doing a bit of everything. Being a generalist, I think much more important than it used to be. If I'm putting together a product team today, I would really obsess about getting as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
What have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people?

Anton Osika (00:01:07):
People love the product. That's the driver of the growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
Today, my guest is Anton O-C-K. Anton is co-founder and CEO of Lovable, which is essentially an AI engineer that takes an English prompt and codes a product for you in minutes. You can then talk to it, iterate on the product, and then launch it to the world. It's one of the fastest growing products in history. The fastest growing startup in Europe ever, and as Anton describes, their goal for Lovable is for it to be the last piece of software that anybody has to write because it'll be able to create all future products for us. They launched just a few months ago in the first four weeks, hit 4 million ARR in the first two months across 10 million ARR, all with just 15 people. Absurd. In our conversation, we covered a lot of ground, including a live demo of Lovable, how their team operates, how they hire, what has most enabled their team to scale this quickly with so few people, pro tips for using Lovable, how it all started, how he recommends you build product teams going forward with tools like this existing, what skills will matter more and less going forward?

(00:02:17):
Plus how to think about Lovable versus competitors and so much more. If you're trying to wrap your head around how product building will change with the rise of AI tools, this episode is a must watch.

This episode is brought to you by Cinch the customer Communications Cloud. Here's the thing about digital customer communications. Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Cinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Cinch's API to build messaging, email and calling into their products. And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about. Rich Communication Services or RCS, think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience, plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies, and here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Cinch is already helping Nature Brands send RCS messages around the world and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

Anton, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Anton Osika (00:05:19):
It's a pleasure to talk to you, Lenny, great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:22):
I don't know how you have time to do this podcast. Your life must be insane these days with the pace at which you guys are scaling, just how much is changing in AI every day. So I just extra appreciate you making time for this. I think you said it's 10:30, your time, is when we're doing this.

Anton Osika (00:05:39):
I'm a bit tired, yes. Mostly from the crazy pace of everything, but yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:45):
This is going to be an invigorating conversation and you're not going to be able to sleep.

Anton Osika (00:05:50):
Yes. I'm sure. I'm sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
Okay, so for folks that are maybe a little bit familiar with Lovable or not at all familiar, what is Lovable? What's the simplest way to understand it?

Anton Osika (00:06:00):
I'd say Lovable is your personal AI software engineer. You describe an idea and then you get a fully working product from the AI. And what this means is that entrepreneurs actually today, they turn their ideas into real businesses. We have a lot of designers and product managers that create the first version of their product ideas to show to the teams, and some of them become founders because of the empowerment from this, but also developers themselves, they actually writing code or creating products much faster. The reason, it's pretty obvious for me, but I'll spell it out, the reason why we're doing Lovable is that I don't know about your mom, but my mom doesn't write code and-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:52):
Same.

Anton Osika (00:06:55):
... almost all my friends throughout my life reached out for help. Like, "Anton, I need to build something. How do I find a great software engineer?" And we are building for this 99% of the population who don't write code. Currently, if you're technically inclined, you get much further, but over time, naturally the way to build software is by just talking to an AI. And that's how we see it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:21):
I love the way that you guys describe it and you didn't mention it, but I think it's building the last piece of software ever. How do you phrase that?

Anton Osika (00:07:28):
Yeah, we say we're building the last piece of software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:31):
The last piece of software. Okay, we're going to do a live demo, but first of all, can you just share some stats on the scale of this business at this point because it's quite absurd.

Anton Osika (00:07:42):
Yeah. So we launched Lovable less than three months ago, and now we have 300,000 monthly active users and 30,000 of those are actually paying and it is growing at the same rates, just almost only through organic word of mouth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:02):
Okay. And I'll share a couple stats in terms of revenue, just so folks know this, and we'll have this in the intro too. I think you guys hit 4 million ARR in the first four weeks. You hit 10 million ARR in the first two months with just 15 people. You're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe, and you guys had to rewrite your entire code base recently and you couldn't ship any new features for a while. Is that right?

Anton Osika (00:08:26):
That's right, yeah. People were saying like, "Oh, you're shipping so fast." And we were all quite frustrated because we wrote our service in this kind of scripting language and then as we started scaling, we were just, no, we have to throw everything away and rewrite it in a more performant way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:43):
Okay, before we get to the demo, last question, you shared there's some companies that have started based on Lovable. I didn't even know that. So what are some examples of companies slash businesses that have launched off of Lovable and now are actually companies?

Anton Osika (00:08:56):
I mentioned designers using Lovable and one of our early users, Harry, he started shipping real web apps to his clients instead of just shipping designs. And then he went on to say, okay, wait, I'm going to start an AI startup. And his company, he launched on Product Hunt and everything and making money is just like, let's anyone upload their photo library and then the AI parses and categorizes it. And if you go to launched.lovable.app, this is an app built with Lovable is again a product Hunt version where you can see a lot of businesses or small SaaS featured there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):
Okay, cool. So we're going to come back to some of this stuff, but let's get into demo. I rarely do demos on this podcast, but I'm finding that I think it's really important for people to see these products in action because in a large part, this is the future of product building and a lot of people hear about, "Oh yeah, AI's coming," and I don't think a lot of people actually see what the latest tools are capable of. And so I love showing these sorts of things on this podcast.

Anton Osika (00:10:05):
So Lenny, I was thinking, did you ever consider making a copy and build your own Airbnb?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:14):
I haven't, but go on.

Anton Osika (00:10:17):
How about you do that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):
Let's do it. Let's do it. Okay, so we're going to make our own Airbnb.

Anton Osika (00:10:18):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
Okay, cool.

Anton Osika (00:10:22):
So I just put in the first prompt for an Airbnb clone.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:27):
Okay. And what is the prompt, just for folks that aren't watching?

Anton Osika (00:10:31):
Two words, Airbnb clones. That's the prompt.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:33):
Okay.

Anton Osika (00:10:34):
Just start simple and then what you get is that the AI says, okay, I can go through what does a beautiful Airbnb clone look like and it goes through a bit of design decisions and then I'll zoom out to see more of it. We have this just UI that is... I mean it has all the nice things you would expect from Airbnb clone where you see different categories and you can see two listings from Airbnb with login buttons and everything. So far it doesn't have the functionality of Airbnb, it just has the UI. I would now ask for an improvement on some of the functionality. Like if I'm switching category, I want to see different listings, let's say. But if you have any thoughts on what we should build next, let me know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:25):
Okay, and so you had this preloaded, so you didn't see how long it would take, but how long would this normally take for it to just write all this code and have it for you?

Anton Osika (00:11:32):
The first prompt takes 30 seconds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):
30 seconds? Okay. And it's like a very good copy of Airbnb. I love that you didn't have to show it a design, you just tell it Airbnb and it knows. Okay, so your question is would I want to add to my own version of Airbnb? I've always wanted to explore buying the place that I look at just like, Is this for sale? So what if we see what that would feel like if you're just a way to buy a listing.

Anton Osika (00:11:59):
Okay. Okay. So how about we add, I mean prompting is important here, so let's be specific, but we would ask, add a button on the listing which has purchased this Airbnb home. Is that it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
Perfect.

Anton Osika (00:12:19):
Okay, so, add, and [inaudible 00:12:19]. I'll be even more specific. It will pop up a model to purchase the listing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:32):
Perfect. And I love... So I think something as you're typing, I'm just going to share thoughts as you're doing this. So the site that you asked this AI engineer to build, it's actually a functioning website that you can browse around. It's not just a design, obviously there's no actual listings here, there's no actual houses here. Say you were trying to actually build Airbnb and you wanted to start adding actual homes that plug into this, how does that sort of step work?

Anton Osika (00:13:02):
So as you say, this is just kind of the mockup UI, but it's also interactive. If I want to add login and add listing management, then we will connect something called the backend. So where data is stored, where user's log information is stored, and I can show you how to do that. First let's just try out where we got with this short prompt.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
Let's do it.

Anton Osika (00:13:31):
Adding the purchase listing and it didn't do exactly what I wanted. I said, add a button... Or I didn't say what a button should say, but it says book now, and if I click book now I get a booking confirmation. So the AI was like, okay, it didn't... It was probably surprised by you wanting to buy the listing since it's Airbnb. So it still says book the listing, but it shows a pretty model where I can click confirm and pay. And then it's says booking confirmed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:05):
I'll just say real quick, I love that this is actually a really good example of why being a good product manager is important. A lot of wasted time happens when you're not clear about the problem you're trying to solve and why you're trying to solve it and all that kind of stuff. So it's really cool that this is a use case where you have to be really good at explaining what it is you want. And it's interesting, you don't have to tell this AI-why. Humans want to understand, "Why is this important." Mostly you need to be very clear about what it is you're doing and I love that's a really strong PM skill. Your PM's really good at that. So we have to...

Anton Osika (00:14:39):
Hey. Explaining exactly what you expect and what you're not getting is even more important with AI than with the humans. So I'm going into hooking up more of the actual functionality, but first I'll actually show you something. What's the fastest way to change what went wrong, it's created buttons that say book now and I want them to say, "Buy now." And what I could do is select this item and say change it to buy now. But what we just realized is that you can actually edit this, this is a fully functioning product, but you can edit it visually like you do in Squarespace and Wix and so on. So I'll just change the text to buy now and then it instantly changes. It actually changes deep down in the code base, but it's very fast to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
So I think people listening to this and seeing this, if you're not aware this is the cutting edge of tools like this, no other tool out there lets you generate code from an AI engineer and then actually just change a small element of it of every other tool that I'm aware of. You have to ask the agent, do this for me, and then you hope that it does the right thing. So this is a huge deal which you just showed. Right?

Anton Osika (00:16:00):
Yeah. Now it says buy now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:01):
Okay. Like that's amazing. Okay, and that's something you just launched?

Anton Osika (00:16:04):
Yeah. Great. We just launched this a few days ago, but I won't go into for building the full functionality, but what it looks like is that you connect an open source backend as a service and that's called SuperBase. And I have this instance to connect to that's completely empty, just like one click to set that up and now it's connected to the backend. It's just automatically generating some code and explaining what I can do next. And what I would do now is, say, let's add login, let's say let's add login.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):
And where is it actually hosted on the backend and everything in general?

Anton Osika (00:16:45):
So everything can be one click deployed and then it's running. It's hosted by a cloud vendor, which is hosting, I think a huge chunk of the internet, it's called Cloudflare, and the backend is hosted by also good cloud writer, which is called SuperBase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:07):
Amazing. Okay, let's wrap up the demo, that was... Unless there's anything else, was there anything else really important that you wanted to show?

Anton Osika (00:17:14):
No I'll just explain what I would do next. I would say, okay, let's add login. Let's make the listings editable by the users so users can upload listings and then this is going to take a bit more time, but with patience and good prompting skills, you're going to get to a full working Airbnb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:33):
That was a really good piece to add. So basically this is getting to a place where it actually is not so different from actual Airbnb. People can log in, they can add their home, you can add internal tools to add listings for your, say, sales team, ops team. Basically it just will allow you to build a marketplace that looks a lot like Airbnb. Amazing. Okay, thank you for the demo. I think for a lot of people they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I've seen this kind of stuff," for most people, like, "Holy shit." It's unreal what... It's almost like we're taking for granted now. You can ask an app to build you a whole website and that costs probably like a few pennies. It took like five minutes versus it would've been tens of thousands and weeks and weeks and months to even build just a prototype.

Anton Osika (00:18:23):
I mean, these tools as we see here, they're already very good, it looks really good as well, but mainly I would say they're getting better very, very fast. And I'd say one of the bigger bottlenecks is now they're not integrated into the current way that you have your existing products and so on. But since they're getting better so fast, I think the best thing for people who are interested in this or interested in just being a part of the future economies, get your hands very dirty with these tools because being in the top 10% in using them is going to absolutely set you apart in the coming months and years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:05):
So let me follow that thread. So say you are magically able to sit next to everybody that is using Lovable for the first time and you could just whisper a tip in their ear to be successful with Lovable, what would that tip be?

Anton Osika (00:19:20):
It takes a lot to master using tools like Lovable and being very curious and patient and we have something called chat mode where you can just ask to understand like, "How does this work? I'm not getting what I want here, am I missing something? What should I do?" Is the best way to be productive is also one of the best ways to just learn about how software engineering works, which is you don't have to write the code anymore, but it is useful to understand how software engin- or how building products works. So I think that's the patience and curiosity is super useful. The second part that we spoke about is that being, if I would sit next to you, I would probably say like, "Hey, you are not being super clear here." For example, don't say it doesn't work. Just explain exactly what you're expecting and which parts are working and which parts are not working. And that's something that a lot of people don't do naturally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
I love that when you have an engineer you're working with that does a very expensive mistake to miscommunicate something, to just forget about a feature, to forget a better requirement, and here it's... You do that and then 30 seconds later you're like, "Oh okay, sorry, that was wrong." And then you could just try again.

Anton Osika (00:20:41):
That's true. It might be more costly with humans.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
Okay, and so the first step is chat mode. So your advice is chat with the... What do you call it? Do you call it an agent? What's the term for the thing that you were talking with?

Anton Osika (00:20:57):
Yeah, Lovable is an agent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:59):
Just Lovable?

Anton Osika (00:20:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:00):
Okay. So you're talking about Lovable by the way. How decide on Lovable as the name? It's so sweet.

Anton Osika (00:21:06):
I think it's all about building a great product. That's what I want more people to be able to do and the best word for a great product is that it's Lovable. A lot of jargon that I like to use to emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum Lovable product and then building a Lovable product and then building an absolutely Lovable product. So I took that jargon with me in the company name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):
That is great. Absolute Lovable product. ALP is the new MVP. Okay, so we talked about this, the scale you guys have hit at this point, I imagine it's far beyond 10 million ARR. Do you share that at this point or are you keeping that private?

Anton Osika (00:21:51):
We don't anchor on the numbers, but I could probably do a two X tweet about this quite soon. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:57):
Okay, so it's far beyond 10 million ARR at this point. It's one of the fastest growing startups in history, the fastest growing startup in Europe. I want to zoom us back to the beginning. What is the origin story of Lovable? How did it all begin? What was the journey to today?

Anton Osika (00:22:14):
I think I was not impressed by what people were doing with the large language models [inaudible 00:22:21], especially after I was using them way back. But when ChatGPT came out, they were starting to get really good at taking a human instruction and spitting out code and then people in my team, I was the CTO at a YC startup, they felt like, "Oh, Anton, you're exaggerating. This is not going to change anything in the coming years." So I wanted to prove a point and I created an open source tool called GPT Engineer where you write something like create a snake game and then it spits out a lot of code, a little of different files and then opens the snake game. And then I tweeted a video about that and GPT Engineer is to date the most popular open source tool to showcase the ability for large language models to create applications and it's at like 50 something thousand GitHub stars and dozens of academic references.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:21):
And I know that I'll just add that it GitHub shut you down because they thought it was some kind of attack, like how many stars you're getting, how many people were using it,

Anton Osika (00:23:29):
Right. Yeah. So that came later. That's with Lovable. So this is Lovable. Lovable, earlier was always creating new projects on GitHub when someone used Lovable and we asked them, "Is it fine? How was the limits here?" They said, "Oh, there are no limits." But once we started creating 15,000 projects per day, so there were a lot of usage. Then some engineer when was on call, maybe they woke up in the night and they saw their servers were taking too much load because of us. So then they shut off down completely and we got this email that said, "Oh, you broke some kind of rules and we didn't know what was going on."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:13):
That's similar to a story I heard when ChatGPT was originally being trained, Microsoft servers blocked it because they thought it was some crawler and it was just actually the very first version ChatGPT being trained on data. Anyway, keep going.

Anton Osika (00:24:29):
So I built this tool called GPT Engineer and I was thinking about we're seeing the biggest change humanity will ever see, I think, where before you had the manual labor being taken over by machines, but now it's actually cognitive labor being done better than humans by machines and what's the best way to have some kind of positive impact here? It's not to make engineers more productive, which there's a lot of companies using AI to make engineers more productive, Microsoft did with co-pilot and so on. But it is to enable those who have such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their beliefs into reality. So enabling more entrepreneurship and innovation by building the AI software engineer for anyone. And then I grabbed a previous colleague of mine who has also been a founder, Fabian, and I said we should build something like GPT Engineer but it has to be for the people who don't write code and that's the story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:43):
Okay. And then that became lovable? There's the shift from open source into a product that anyone can use but also pay for. Makes sense. Okay, so from that point I saw a stat that you started making a million dollars in ARR per week and once you launched lovable, is that true?

Anton Osika (00:26:00):
Yeah, so launched, we actually called the first version of the product like GPT Engineer app and it was very different in some ways and we launched that under a waitlist and said like, Oh yeah, we have this waitlist and we got a lot of feedback and iterated. Finally, when we thought the product was really good we said okay, now we have a Lovable product. And it was mainly on the AI that we did a lot of improvements, once we launched that, that was 21st of November, so that's almost three months ago. We just hit 1 million ARR in a week and then it kept growing at that pace. It still growing at even faster than that pace.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
Faster than 1 million ARR per week. Holy shit.

Anton Osika (00:26:48):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:48):
Okay, that sounds like product market fit to me. You said that you did a lot of work on the backend. I saw you tweet about this that you guys figured out some kind of unlock on scalability, like a new scaling law that allowed you to build something like this. What can you talk about there that on the technical element allowed you to build something new and the successful?

Anton Osika (00:27:08):
There are many scaling laws I would say when you build AI systems and this one in particular is about when you put in more work, the product reliably gets better and better. And what you've seen generally when you have AI building something is that it can get stuck in some place. It is super good in the beginning and then it gets stuck. What we did was to painstakingly identify places where it got stuck and there is different approaches but address different ways how we do it but address the places where it gets stuck, tune the entire system quantitatively and having a very fast feedback loop to improve it in the areas where it got stuck. The most important areas, it still does get stuck sometimes, but that's the scaling law and we're still early in that scaling law, I would say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:04):
And so when you talk about things getting stuck, it's like the AI agent just saying, I don't know what to do from this point or they introduce some kind of bug. Is that an example of getting stuck?

Anton Osika (00:28:13):
Yeah. It introduces some kind of bug and then it's not smart enough to figure out how to get out of that bug.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:20):
I see. And this is a common problem people have with tools like this is they get to a certain point and then it's like, "Well I don't know what to do. I'm not an engineer, here's a bug it's running into or the infrastructure's built the wrong way." And so it sounds like one of the paths to solving that is what you're describing is you make the AI smarter to avoid more and more of these places they get stuck. Another is people just learning how to get AI unstuck. This is something when we had Amjad on the podcast from Replit, he said that this is the main skill that he thinks people need to learn is how to unstuck AI when it runs into a problem. Just thoughts there, I don't know anything along those lines come up as I say that.

Anton Osika (00:29:04):
This is something that is a problem today and the frontier of where this is a problem is very rapidly receding back. So what we did was we identified the most important areas, so specifically adding login, creating data persistence, adding payment with Stripe. Those are the things that we made sure it doesn't get stuck on, for example. And the places where it gets stuck today is currently something that you can use being very good at understanding and getting unstuck, but in the future it won't be so important. This experience just going to not get stuck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:48):
And I know you're not talking super in-depth about this because this is one of your unfair advantages, this kind of stuff you figured out. So I'm not going to push too far. I know you want not everyone's into exactly the same stuff. So I want to zoom back to the pace of growth that you guys have seen. One of the big stories, everyone's always looking at you guys of like 15 people, 10 million ARR in two months. That's absurd. I don't know if it's ever been done in history. If so, it's maybe a couple other AI startups recently. How have you been able to do this? What have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people?

Anton Osika (00:30:24):
I'd like to take credit of having done everything end to end in the product, but we are building on top of taking the oil here, which we have discovered oil, which is are the foundation models and then what we've done is that we're obsessed about what's the right way to present this to a user. What's the interface for the human to get as much out of this as possible? Packaging together, I showed you in the demo how you can add authentication and making this work seamlessly together as a whole. That's what we've done. And then people love the product. That's the driver of the growth. For getting awareness, we've mainly been posting what we've shipped on social media, that's how people know about us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:17):
So building in public is how people usually describe that. So I think it's like you guys have the advantage of the demos are just like, "Holy shit, you can do that." And then you guys share the numbers that you guys are growing at. So it's innately interesting and shareable, but I imagine most people have something interesting to share. I guess is there anything that you think you did that other companies maybe haven't done that make the product so lovable?

Anton Osika (00:31:43):
I mean the team is everything in building a great product, so I just give a big shout-out to the team that has written the code. I haven't written much of the code recently, I would say. You want people who can ship really fast and have good taste for what this simple, what's the right abstractions and I think that's what we've done differently and have this obsession for us making it better and better and better.

(00:33:22):
Okay, I want to come back to the team. I know you have a lot of thoughts there in terms of writing code, how much do you guys actually use AI to write the code that is building Lovable? How does that work on your team?

Anton Osika (00:33:32):
We have set up lovable so that we can change lovable with itself. We have done that. There is a lot of hyper-specific things in terms of running a separate... We spin up a dedicated computer for each user. It doesn't do everything. Lovable doesn't do everything. So we use the tools that are for developers, not for the 99%, most of the time. And everyone uses AI all the time in writing code. It's also in great course for experimentations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):
And are there tools like Cursor and stuff like that? Like any tools you can share right now?

Anton Osika (00:34:14):
Yeah. I think Cursor is the one that almost everyone uses in the team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:19):
Yeah. Okay, cool. I did a survey recently on tools that my listeners and readers use in cursor. 17% of all people that read my newsletter use Cursor already, which is absurd and you guys are in there, too. Okay, so kind of along these lines, there's obviously other competitors and companies in this space, so everyone's always wondering, you, Bolt, Replit, Cursor is a different kind of thing. What's the simplest way to understand maybe how Lovable might be different from say Bolt and Replit, which I think are probably the closest.

Anton Osika (00:34:49):
The packaging for non-technical people is what we aim for and I showed you in the demo that you can edit the text, you can change the colors and so on instantly without having to go into the code editor and without having to wait about 30 seconds for the AI do the full change. So that's the big way that we think about packaging it. And then for making sure that this can be used as productively as possible in a larger team. Something that's different from I think all the other tools is that it is synchronized with GitHub and that means that you can use Cursor, or the people in your team that want to be more low-level, they can use Cursor and while the people who don't want to mess and set up their local file system and commit to GitHub and so on, they can use Lovable's.

(00:35:48):
Not getting stuck is I think the most important thing for people. And that's why we entered this space late, we haven't done the same type of marketing as many others and we still, from the people that I talked to, ranked as the one that works most reliably.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:06):
I love it. Okay. So this point about how you can just use Lovable to build a lot of it for you and then get into Cursor to edit and tweak is a really big point. And you're saying other companies aren't as good at that. I don't know if any other does that.

Anton Osika (00:36:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:23):
I don't think they let you do that. Amazing. Okay. And then what's the vision for Lovable? What's the end state of this? Is this everybody can build anything they want sort of thing? What's the simplest way to understand where you're going in the next, I don't know, five, 10 years.

Anton Osika (00:36:37):
I have to say. So we're building the last piece of software and it is inherently very hard to predict how the world looks like in five years. These days it's very hard. But the last piece of software, how I see that is that it's almost instant to go from what you want to change in the product or what product you want to build to having it fully working end-to-end, integrated with any of your existing systems or integrated with the very powerful third-party providers. Already today you can just ask, add and chat with OpenAI and then you get the chat with OpenAI in your product. But that's just working perfectly is something that's coming in the coming two years, I would say. And then after that there is a lot of things in building a product that is not just the engineering side, right? And I think an AI can be very useful in aggregating and understanding your users.

(00:37:42):
So, if you use the analytics tools, you know that there is something quite common which is to see how users have interacted with the product. AIs can do that on an absolutely massive scale and propose changes to a human to say, "Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good change to make it a bit more intuitive." And it can also automatically run A-B tests so that you can see the data, all these improvements to the product. I think that's on the horizon as well, quite.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:15):
What's interesting about this in one way is people wonder just what jobs will be more important, what skills will be less important? Let me share a thought I have and then I want to get your take and see where you go with this. It feels like what is getting more valuable is being good at figuring out what to build and then knowing if the thing you had built is correct and good and ready. So it's like discovery, ideation, idea, part of the step of launching a product and then it's like taste and craft. Just like is this the thing? Is this going to solve people's problems because the building now is being done more and more and it's interesting, it used to be the reverse engineering was the hardest, most valuable skill and now it's figuring out what to build.

(00:38:59):
You could sit there and you could just tell it what to build and a lot of people get to your screen I'm sure and they're like, "I don't know what to build, I don't know what people want." And it's like that's the thing now. So just reactions to that and thoughts on what's skills will matter more and less.

Anton Osika (00:39:13):
I mean if you're a founder or you want to build something. Yeah, I totally agree that figuring out what are pain points and seeing there are often currently solutions, some kind of solution to everything. How can you make this 10X better somehow figuring that out is super important when you have an existing product. Then I think taste and tasting what is good is even more of the important part. The engineer skill set is still going to be important because that helps you understand what are the constraints, so what you can build and I just think a lot of software engineers are probably a bit scared now like, "Okay, am I out of a job? What's going to happen?" But they should see themselves as the people who translate the problems that are stated a human, probably, to technical solutions, but they do have to abstract themselves up a few steps, not just looking at in their tech stack like oh I can just do the front end changes. Engineers or technical people are very good at understanding what are the constraints technically and they should see themselves as that translators.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:30):
Is it almost like you want to learn the eng manager skill of overseeing engineers versus the actual engineering skill or you think it's still going to be really important to learn how to code and be really good at that?

Anton Osika (00:40:44):
I mean doing a bit of everything. Being a generalist is I think much more important than it used to be. And if I'm putting together a product team today, I would re-obsess about getting as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire. They should know how architecting a system works, preferably they should know the sign, they should have product taste, they should know how to talk to users. I think everyone should know a bit of all of that, preferably.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):
Easier said than done. It's hard to find people that know all these things. So let's segue to hiring and how you hire. How many people do you have at this point? Is that something you share?

Anton Osika (00:41:27):
Yeah, now we're at 18.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:29):
18. Okay. Wow. I love that you... It sounded like you're about to say, "Oh, we have a hundred people now." No, 18. Okay, so you went from 15 to 18. Okay, great. So what do you look for when you're hiring people? The way I saw you describe it on Twitter is you look for cracked engineers, the best crack team in Europe, things like that. I guess just specifically what are you looking for when you're hiring?

Anton Osika (00:41:52):
I think the most important thing is that people care a lot and they're not just like, "Oh, I'm here for a job. I'm here for being just a passenger on this journey," but everyone should really care about the product, the users and care a ton about the team, how the team works together and that you're always contributing to making the team work more productively together and that care or preferably obsession gets you a very long way and then you do often want to have absolute superpower in some dimension to be able to understand and do as many possible things as possible, have this generalist brain that quickly learns any skill but be super, super good in one dimension. And for us that's mostly cramming as much out of AI, out of the large language models and understanding the entire parameter space of what you can change to make our product perform better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:58):
So, how do you actually test for these things? Some of these things describe, I think everyone's looking for, they care about the user, they want to collaborate well. Because you have 18 people building in a company that's growing more than a million ARR every week. That's an absurd scale and the people you have found are clearly world-class and I think a lot of people are going to want to hire the type of people you're hiring. So when you're actually interviewing, how do you suss out some of these things like their AI cramming skills, their team building collaboration, what do you actually do?

Anton Osika (00:43:32):
I ask people what they've done before and these people that I'm describing, they have often done something where they care a lot about what they've done before and dig into details about the technical things that they did. And then we do the normal thing of showing a very hard problem that is a bit unorthodox that someone hasn't seen before preferably and see how they think through thinking research through that. Then something that I think is more uncommon is that we do, I pretty much always have people join the work simulation for at least a day, often a full week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
Awesome. Okay, so work trial. That's awesome. So basically they work with the team for at least a day. You said sometimes a week, and I love this point you made about they care deeply about something they previously worked on and you look for just obsession with the thing that they built last or something they worked on. What percentage are engineers of these 18?

Anton Osika (00:44:39):
So 12 at least write code at least part-time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:44):
12 out of 18. Okay, cool. When we were setting up, you're like, "Oh, our engineer's creating content now." I think that's a cool example of how people do a lot of different things. Also. Okay, so I have your job posting that you shared once of the actual job description. I'm going to read a few lines from it. It's very inspired by Shackleton, right?

Anton Osika (00:45:07):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):
Would you agree? Cool. I love it. By the way, did you write this or did you have AI write this job description where you create an engineering job description? In fact, let me read it to you. I don't even know, you may not know what M you're referring to. I'll read a few lines here. "Long hours, high pace, candidates must thrive under a high urgency under AGI timelines approaching, difficult mission ahead, honor and recognition in case of success, those seeking comfortable work need not apply." And then there's a few other things, "Collaboration with other exceptional minds, purpose larger than any normal engineering role, generous share in the venture success." Amazing.

Anton Osika (00:45:44):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:44):
Thoughts?

Anton Osika (00:45:45):
Yeah, so I did get some help with the formatting of this, but then it was mostly me doing the exact phrasing of the different sentences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):
So good. And I love that to some people it's going to be like, "Holy shit, I'm not signing up for this." But to a lot of people, the people you want is like, "Yes, this is exactly what I want to be doing."

Anton Osika (00:46:07):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:07):
Amazing.

Anton Osika (00:46:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):
Okay, cool. So it feels like one of the elements of hiring here is, create a really good filter to be clear about just how intense this is so that the people that want that are the ones drawn to you. Okay. And then you're also, you're in Sweden, fastest growing startup in Europe ever thoughts on building in Europe slash Sweden versus the US slash San Francisco?

Anton Osika (00:46:34):
Yeah, so this ambition level that you're talking about in the job ad is more uncommon in Sweden and I think that is the biggest unlock that someone like me, sees that this is the time in human history when you have the most impact for a worked hour and that's why we have to be super ambitious, just up the ambition level and then we can maybe retire and have AI take care of most things in society and inspiring people to be this ambitious in a place where the average ambition is lower but the talent, the raw talent is much more available, is a great recipe. I think that's a great recipe. And that's, I think it's some kind of advantage there. It is a bit of a double-edged sword but it's some kind of advantage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
So what I'm hearing is there's incredible people in Europe, they're just not, they're harder to find and what I'm hearing is the key is how do you suss them out and get them to want to talk to you?

Anton Osika (00:47:49):
Most people in Europe, they haven't thought that, "Oh, going on an extremely ambitious mission is what I want to do." So that's figuring out who those are is a big part of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):
Awesome. Okay. I want to talk about prioritization. I imagine all these things that I just shared about just how ambitious this mission is, how much you're doing the last piece of software, you must have a bazillion things that people ask you to build that you want to build. What's your approach to deciding what to prioritize and actually build?

Anton Osika (00:48:21):
Just top line? I think identifying what is the biggest bottleneck, what's the biggest problem and iterating fast on saying, "Okay, this is the biggest problem, let's really, really solve that problem." And then picking in the next one and not overthinking, not dreaming out the long roadmap, that's my [inaudible 00:48:41]. There's a very, very simple algorithm. Understanding what is the, mostly the biggest problem is not always a simple problem I think. Yeah, so we spend time as one should on talking to users, reading up on what people are writing. We have the feature board for where people do a lot of requests, as you say. And then when we pick one of the problems, we are quite engineering-led. For a product like ours, it's hard to be have product managers that are not engineers say, oh, this is what we should do now because the right solution to the problem might be entangled in things that are technical details.

(00:49:32):
They might be entangled in technical details of like, "Okay, yes, this is the biggest problem, but we should have this larger technical initiative that's going to solve all of these problems." So it's quite engineering-led compared to many other product companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:48):
As it should. I'd be worried if you guys had a product manager at this point, that wouldn't make no sense right now. I imagine the answer is it's chaos and there's no actual defined process, but just what does it look like generally? What's kind of the cadence you guys operate on? How do you take an idea to build it, spec it, launch it? Just what does that look like if you have something?

Anton Osika (00:50:10):
If you look back three months, we mainly said, "Okay, let's do this weekly planning." We do have a big jam board where we have all the main problems and then we have kind of ranked them which else do we focus or when we focus on next or this week? And then we have a demo where we say, "Okay, these are things we ship this week." So to get everyone on the same page, we do have a bit more of a roadmap now, where we say we are going to make so sure you can support custom domains. Next, they're going to add collaboration after that. And the biggest problem now or the biggest initiative now that solves the biggest problem is making the system more agentic and that has a bit of a longer roadmap, but we still do the cadence of weekly planning. These are the things we're focusing on. This week, it's mostly... There's a good word for this that I would want your help with, but polish, we were fixing the bugs and polish this week and that was the planning on Monday.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:21):
That was actually this week was polish, polish week. I love that. How far is this roadmap that you are now having?

Anton Osika (00:51:28):
I mean it's clear over the coming month, but it stretches out three months, but in one month it's probably going to look a bit different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:39):
Okay. And then what are the tools you use just for folks that want to understand the latest tools? So you said FigJam, what else is in that stack of tools?

Anton Osika (00:51:46):
I mean we do so many things in our company in Linear because it's just amazing product. So we do talent application tracking in Linear and after going through and this thing, lot of the other custom-made tools for that Linear and then FigJam.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:06):
So simple. How soon until one of your engineers is an agent engineer, an AI Engineer, do you have a sense?

Anton Osika (00:52:15):
I love to dig into what does that question actually mean? I think we've been talking about, Oh, AI that would require something playing chess, that's AI. If a computer can play chess, that's AI and now that's like, Oh no, that's a chess program and which always shifting this forward and forward. I think anything that a human doesn't do is just a smart computer system, right? When is an software engineer and agent, I think it's always going to be just we're building in... Lovable is just an interface that humans interact with to create the software that they want and then how we solve that, we said going to be an agent under some definition. Yeah, sure. I think so, but that's less important to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:15):
Okay, I like that. Let me ask this, you guys are moving super fast, scaling like crazy. You described a little bit about your process, weekly planning, FigJam board of ideas and now there's a roadmap that you're kind of thinking out in the future. Is there anything else that you found helps you move this fast that gives you a lot of leverage over the small team you have to ship quickly and move fast that you haven't already mentioned?

Anton Osika (00:53:40):
We work from the office most of the time. I think it's pretty nice. Then you can say like, "Hey, I think we're thinking wrong about this thing," or, "Shouldn't we actually do this other thing?" And especially I think lunch, eating lunch together is a pretty productive hour where you're cross pollinating. I mean people are constantly thinking subconsciously as well about how to solve these different problems and which the most important ones are. And then being in office has this focus or most of the time usually focus, but you also have this high bandwidth where everyone has to be down structured communication.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:18):
I love that. The answer to the CEO of a company that's one of the most advanced AI tools in the world is one of your answers to how to move fast is lunch together. I love that. That's so human and so it makes all the sense in the world, but I love that that's still a part of this.

Anton Osika (00:54:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):
Okay. You talked about this kind of on the same thread you talked about if you were to start a team, like a new product team today, say you were head of product somewhere or head of RPM, VP of product somewhere building a new product team, scaling a product team, what would you do going forward that's different from what people have done in the past in terms of who you're hiring, how you're structuring them, that kind of thing? Just what do you think people should be thinking as they build product teams going forward? Knowing tools like Lovable exist and all the other stuff that's going on.

Anton Osika (00:55:13):
I mean everyone should be excited about using AI. I think that's a pretty big ones. And then the team working really well together is, like the lunch, you have to sit down and solve problems together. The bottleneck for most products these days is not going to be as much on engineering, but having good taste, good intuition about your users. And that, engineers and everyone preferably in the team should have that willingness at least to want to go through that motion and listen to the users and truly understand what they care about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:59):
Well it's kind of like the background of most of the engineers and people you've hired. Is there anything in common? Are they just super impressive humans generally, like champions of programming contests, stuff like that? I don't know. What are some attributes of the folks you've hired so far?

Anton Osika (00:56:19):
I think raw cognitive capability is the strongest, the strongest correlate of being at Lovable. But there is this startup mindset that I think is also very strong. Being much more interested in moving very fast and iterating fast, then having a lot of structure, a lot of process and thinking about the business as a whole. More than thinking about my specific profession, my specific craft that I'm seeing myself wanting to dig into on me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:58):
Amazing. Okay. So smart, very smart entrepreneurial, acts like an owner, isn't just like, this isn't just a job. But they feel like they actually have agency. Okay, this is great. There's something you said kind of along these lines that I think is important that one of the things that gets you excited about what you're building is giving people super powers and especially people that don't add a code, basically 99% of people. Is there anything along those lines that you think is important to share?

Anton Osika (00:57:27):
It's very clear to most people who have been engineers or been founders, that there's so many that have failed in their endeavors because they didn't have someone that know how to solve the technical parts. And now that we're close to having people know that this exists and they solve everything, it's going to be an Cambrian explosion of entrepreneurship and better software product. We're not going to settle for all the annoying bad technology that we use today. And everyone who has an idea is going to say, "Okay, I'm going to build this thing and show you that this is the best version of the product or what our company should be doing," instead of having long meetings or writing up documents. So it's going to be empowering across a lot of different professions and places in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):
What's next for Lovable? What's the next few things they might launch as this episode comes out?

Anton Osika (00:58:38):
As I mentioned this agentic behavior, and when I say agentic, what it means is that you give more freedom to the system to decide what happens next. It might want to write a test, run those tests and say like, "Oh, the test failed, let's fix those." So that's one of the big unlocks for getting further faster. And then there's some more obvious things that you want to do to go all the way to easily go all the way to making money with Lovable. And that's like how do you set up so that it's hosted on your specific domain? How do you collaborate there seamlessly with your team and making that is here so that those are just obvious things and something we're thinking about is to help founders succeed after they built their first version. And how do they get more users? How do they get feedback? How do they get the word out if they build something useful?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:42):
I was just going to say that and that's exactly where my mind went is everyone's going to be building all these things. No one's ever going to get any traction with these tools. No one knows how to find users, get anyone to basically go to market. And growth is a whole different skill. So that is so cool that you're thinking about that. How do we run some paid ads for you? How do we think about SEO? How do we think about word of mouth, reality referrals? That is very cool. Okay.

Anton Osika (01:00:06):
Yeah, we already have playbooks that we help the people building with how do you do those things that you can find up on our blog?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):
Interestingly, this makes me want to buy some meta stock because all these apps that everyone's building, they're going to be running paid ads on Facebook and Google. Oh my god, what a good business those other guys get. I want to come back to, you said that you can work on your existing code base. This is actually a big question for a lot of people. They see all these tools, they're all amazing for prototypes and concepting. You talked about how you can actually do this within your existing code base, use Lovable.

Anton Osika (01:00:41):
Let me correct you there. You cannot use it on any existing code base.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:46):
Got it.

Anton Osika (01:00:47):
We kind of have a research preview of importing your code base, but what you can do is if you start in Lovable, then you can have engineers editing it in whatever tool they want to use for editing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:59):
Okay, cool. That's great clarification. So I guess just for people, because most listeners here are not building something brand new, they're working within an existing product. So you're saying that that is coming, you can use Lovable in the future in some form with your existing app and product?

Anton Osika (01:01:15):
Correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
Wow, that's huge. Okay. Because basically most people, so that's going to be a big deal. Okay. Final question. We have the segment on this podcast called Failure Corner, where most people come to this podcast, they show all these stories of success and everything's going great, and here's all the things always winning. You guys, this is a good example, just up into the right, the fastest growing product ever. What's an example when something totally failed in the course of your career and what did you learn from that?

Anton Osika (01:01:49):
I am a bit hard-pressed to find something that totally failed, but I think there's a bit of a product lesson where I was the first employee at an AI startup here in Stockholm called Summer Labs, and the premise was just, okay, so humans learn in different ways. If you personalize, then you get two standard deviations more effective learning. So there are a lot of products like education software that helps you learn that is not personalized. And we were building an API to personalize learning and the AI and so on, it was pretty good.

(01:02:34):
But the thing that we were doing in the end was to say like, Okay, here's this product. Someone has to build a product or some way to learn or be it like English thing Duolingo, and then the people that have that product have to use this advanced AI API to start making it personalized. And it is very hard retrofitting like, oh, you have to switch out the engine and put in this AI. And the big learning here is that it didn't work very well for the company. I mean, the company wasn't super successful in this. The big learning is that you have to start with how is this product working end-to-end and then add AI or think where should we add AI? So that was a big learning for me that you really want to see what does the big picture of the user, what's the big picture of how do you think the user experience should be? And then add something with AI to solve specific problems. And now Summer Labs is doing great, but it's not on top of that product specifically.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
I think it's a lot of people hear this and they're like, of course, but I think it's so hard to actually remember this point when you have some cool tech and you're like, "Holy shit, everyone needs to try this. They're going to love it." And then you don't realize no one actually cares if it's not solving a problem for them. There's a lot of novelty products that everyone want to use for a little bit and then forget instant, I don't actually need this often. And so what this makes me think about is, there's all these product lessons for what is likely to help your product be successful. And an app like a tool like Lovable can help you do this because if someone is building something, you can guide them, Okay, what's the problem you're solving for somebody? How many people have this problem? How much does this matter to them?

Anton Osika (01:04:38):
Maybe we should add the Lenny mode. It activates in Lovable, it activates this product coach. That would be infinite questions, like, "No, no, wait, hold on, why are you doing this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):
Absolutely. Let's take a step back. Everyone's going to be like, "[inaudible 01:04:55], get out of my way."

Anton Osika (01:04:57):
[inaudible 01:04:57].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):
Yeah, exactly. What's your experiment plan? I think there's actually a big opportunity there to save people. There's a play around with this thing and then there's like, okay, but really is this anything people actually want?

Anton Osika (01:05:09):
I love it. Can we call it Lenny mode? Is that fine with you?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):
100%.

Anton Osika (01:05:13):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):
Let's do it. I'll license you no cost.

Anton Osika (01:05:16):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
Okay. Okay. We made a deal here. Let's do it. Okay, Anton, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything you want to leave listeners with before I let you go and go to sleep?

Anton Osika (01:05:28):
I think, again, the world is changing quickly and it's very fun. You should see that's like have fun in all of this change, and the best thing you can do for your current profession or if you want to have a new job is to be in the top 1% in knowing how to use AI tools. So go out there, use Loveable, use other AI tools, and become... Make sure to understand or try to understand as much as possible in how to use them productively. That's something I tell all my friends generally, and I love the audience to know as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:06):
Okay. Well, I got to try to make this even more specific for people. How do you know if you're in the top 1%? What's a heuristic almost slash how do you get there? Is it just use it a hundred times a day? What else? What can you recommend?

Anton Osika (01:06:19):
Yeah. I think if you spend a full week on trying to reach an outcome, the best way to learn is I want to do this thing and then I want to use AI to do that thing. And you've spent a full week, you are in the top 1% in the global population. And if you surround yourself with friends who have this obsession or they also care a lot about this, then you'd be quickly in the top 0.1%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:47):
So what I'm hearing is find a problem that can be solved, find a problem, a pain point for yourself or someone, and then end-to-end fully solve that problem. Spend a week getting from idea to a thing that somebody's actually using and you're in the top 1%.

Anton Osika (01:07:03):
Yeah. I think... At the top, yeah, the top 1% by just spending a full week and asking AI if you don't understand. So making sure that you understand.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):
Yeah, that's the thing people forget. You just ask. Would you ask the chat feature of Lovable in this case or would you go to Cloud or ChatGPT to ask for advice?

Anton Osika (01:07:24):
I mean, my recommendation here, if you're in product is to use Lovable to build software and learn that AI tool and then you should use ChatMode and ChatMode, I have to add, is something you activate in your user profile. It's not launched in the main product, so it's in labs, but if you add that flag, then you can use ChatMode. If you want to learn some other AI tool, then you should ask that tool or ask Cloud, ChatGPT about how that topic, that domain works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:02):
Okay, amazing. Where can people find you? Where can they find Lovable and how can listeners be useful to you?

Anton Osika (01:08:09):
Lovable posts updates, and memes on Lovable underscore dev on Twitter, we post things on LinkedIn as well, and there are a lot of things coming out and changing in how we build software, so you can follow Lovable underscore dev and you can follow me at AntonOsika at Twitter. I'd love more feedback on where people see this is a huge change for them. There are a lot of people posting about that on Twitter, but we have a Discord where you can share like, "Oh, this is how I use Lovable. It was super useful to me." And feedback.lovable.dev can ask for new features. There's a lot of people asking and uploading what features you want next. And that's super useful. That's the most important thing for us. We just want to solve people's problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:04):
Amazing. Anton, you're doing incredible work. What a journey. I'm excited to have you back someday when we see more chapters of this journey.

Anton Osika (01:09:12):
I have a lot more to learn.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:13):
As do we all. That's why people listen to this podcast. Anton, thank you so much for being here.

## Transcript

April Dunford (00:00:00):
40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it." Because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:00:39):
Today. My guest is April Dunford. April is the world's foremost authority on product positioning. She's the author of the bestselling book, Obviously Awesome, which is my favorite book on positioning. And this is her second time on the podcast because she just published a new book called Sales Pitch, which builds on her 25-year career as VP of marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games and many others. The book guides you through a better way to pitch and sell your product. And in our conversation, April shares the framework that she has seen work most often in getting potential customers to get excited about your product and to decide to buy your product.

(00:01:16):
Like I say, at the top of this episode, you'll become better at pitching and selling your product by the end of this episode. And if that's useful to you, which it should be, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you April Dunford after a short word from our sponsors.

Speaker 1 (00:01:32):
This episode is brought to you by Composer, the AI powered trading platform now with retirement accounts. Algorithmic trading has historically been reserved for the hedge fund elite. Now with Composer, you can automate your trading with a library of over 1000 strategies that are easy to understand and tweak using an AI assistant and visual editor. Composer is the first ever algorithmic trading platform where you don't need any coding experience. It includes a full range of trading indicators for you to get creative and a Discord community of 2,500 traders to discuss your ideas with.

(00:02:06):
Composer also has a powerful back tester to see the historical performance of your strategies, and you can then invest with a single click. Once you invest, Composer will automatically trade for you based on the logic of your strategy. With $1 billion in trading volume and over 1 million trades executed, composer already has many big time investors using the platform regularly.

(00:02:26):
Head to composer.trade and use the code Lenny for an extra week of free trial on your composer membership. That's composer.trade. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, click up, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:03:04):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:03:47):
April, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast.

April Dunford (00:03:52):
So great to be back. We were talking about this earlier, but it feels like it was so long ago when I did the last one. I was one of the first guests and I feel like, man, you've been running this thing forever. And that was like a year ago.

Lenny (00:04:05):
It feels like a lifetime, but it was about a year ago.

April Dunford (00:04:08):
But what you've done with it is amazing, right? The growth in it, everything else, it's super inspirational.

Lenny (00:04:13):
Thanks April. I appreciate that.

April Dunford (00:04:15):
You're welcome. It's true though. I think everybody looks at your stuff and goes, "What the heck? How does he do it?"

Lenny (00:04:22):
The secret is a lot of work.

April Dunford (00:04:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:04:24):
That's the get rich quick scheme there.

April Dunford (00:04:28):
Nobody wants to hear that.

Lenny (00:04:30):
Yeah. But it's work that's extremely fulfilling and we get to chat again and you are a very rare return guest, which makes me very happy. And the reason you're back is you've written an incredible new book, which I have right here if you're on YouTube called Sales Pitch.

April Dunford (00:04:44):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:04:45):
There it is. And it's in your background, too. It's like a inception. The book is called Sales Pitch, How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win. And we're going to be spending our time today digging into all of the lessons and frameworks in the book as much as we can in the hour that we have. And my goal for this conversation is for listeners to leave this podcast with better skills at pitching and selling their product. Which I think every product leader and founder will want to do and get better at. How does that sound?

April Dunford (00:05:13):
That sounds great.

Lenny (00:05:14):
Okay, sweet. I was thinking as a way to get into the conversation, we start with maybe a story or an example of a company that you worked with where you applied the frameworks and lessons they teach in the book. And then use that as kind of a jumping off point for digging in further.

April Dunford (00:05:30):
Yeah, sure. So my background is, I do positioning work. And so in the work that I do with clients, generally what we're working on is a shift in the positioning, which is a little bit of a shift in our thinking around, how do we win in the market? So in order to test that positioning, what we want to do is take the positioning and translate it into a sales pitch and then test it live with prospects.

(00:05:53):
And one of the things I noticed right at the beginning of doing this work is that everybody's sales pitch kind of looked the same and they weren't all that great. And for the most part what was happening in the sales pitch is there was no positioning going on in the sales pitch at all. The sales pitch was essentially a product exposition, so essentially a glorified product box room. If there was five dropdown menus, we're going to click on all five dropdown menus and show everybody everything just feature, feature, feature, feature, feature.

(00:06:24):
And so, most of the teams weren't used to doing any kind of pitching in the pitch really. It was just the facts Jack, were just going to show you that. Some would do this really lightweight thing. Here's the problem, we're the solution. Now let me walk you through all the dropdown menus, but it is basically the same thing like that.

(00:06:43):
And so what I wanted to do was build a pitch structure that would reflect the positioning. And so in order to do that, we have to get a little bit into storytelling mode. Not a lot, but at least a little. And when we're talking about features, we shouldn't be talking about features. We should be talking about the value that the features deliver.

(00:07:01):
So let me give you an example and I'll do before and after what this would look like. So I work with these folks, Help Scout, and so they're in the customer service space, so think Zendesk or whatever. They're in that space. And what's interesting about them is they were built from the ground up to serve digital businesses. So businesses that don't have a physical store, they don't have sales reps. And so their approach to customer service was different from the outset. Help Scout said, "Well, you know what? Customer service for that kind of business is really important. It's the only time you ever get to interact with actual customers." And so the data shows that if you give them a really great interaction in service, it improves loyalty, it improves repeat purchases, and it's actually a growth driver. Now, most folks in other industries see customer service as a cost center.

(00:07:49):
So your telephone company for example, wants to get you off the phone as fast as possible. And they want to push you to the self-serve FAQ channels, and they don't care about giving you a good service at all. They don't care about any of that. And so they're all about driving the cost down. So if we look at Help Scout in their positioning, the alternatives to Help Scout are a handful of things. Most folks start using a shared inbox and it's really easy to use and the reps love it. It's easy to use. The problem is, is you start growing and then you want customer service features. You want to be able to do assignments and prioritization and things like that. So then these customers end up upgrading to help desk software and now they're in this whole different world.

(00:08:31):
So the first thing is really hard to use. So we're not in shared inbox territory anymore. And the second thing is that there's this attitude of we're trying to push folks to low cost channels. We don't really care about them. We're going to assign you a ticket number. You're not a person anymore. All this stuff. So that's the situation. So Help Scout, if they did a typical pitch the way I see most SaaS companies pitch, they would just expose the features. Right? So the pitch would look like this. Digital business comes in and they say, "Hi, Help Scout, let me show you how to log in, let me show you all the features. Look, there's a shared inbox thing there that's really great. Oh, look, we can do assignments and prioritization and we can do this other thing and we can do this other thing and la, la la." And I keep going until the time runs out and I don't have any more features to talk about.

(00:09:20):
The problem with that pitch is the customer's sitting there going, "I don't know, man, that sounds a little bit like my shared inbox, but it also sounds like help desk software. Is it different than help desk software? I'm not so sure. And there's overlap in the features there." And so it doesn't really answer the question, why pick us over the other guys?

(00:09:42):
And so a different style of pitch would be one, we would do a little bit of setup to give everybody an idea about how we fit amongst all the other solutions and what our point of view is in the market. And then when we get to exploring the features, we would do that within the context of the differentiated value. So here's how that pitch would look like. Customer comes in and Help Scout says, "Hey, digital business, we work with a lot of companies like you, and I'm going to show you the product. But before we get there, one of the things we think is interesting is that digital businesses look at customer service differently. They look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center. And so most of the folks we work with see delivering a really amazing experience as a key part of customer service. Would you agree with that?"

(00:10:26):
Yeah, we would. They have a little conversation and then they say, "Great. We you have choices here. So most of the folks we work with start with a shared inbox, and that's great because it's really easy, really easy to use all that stuff. The problem is if you're growing and you probably are, then you're going to outgrow that because you're going to need prioritizations assignments, help desk stuff.

(00:10:45):
And so then your option is to go to help desk software. And so help desk software is great, does all the things. The problem is that it was not designed for businesses like you. It was designed for businesses that want to take the cost out of customer service. So it's going to do some things that are weird. It's going assign your customers a ticket number and it's going to try to drive them to low cost channels. So can we agree that in a perfect world for digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk, but had all the bells and whistles so we wouldn't have to migrate to something else. And on top of that was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service. Do we agree we want that?"

(00:11:26):
Now, at that point, the customer is either with you or you're not. But if they are, then we switch to the actual demo part. If we do a demo and then we say, "Great, we've got those three things. Let me show you how that works. So one as easy to use an inbox. Look, here's the inbox. It's easy to use. Looks just like an inbox. It's amazing. Two, features, so you never have to outgrow it. Look, here's how we do prioritizations assignments, whatever. We can do all the stuff you need as you grow, and you're never going to have to switch platforms. And then last one, deliver an amazing experience. Look, the customer gets to choose which channel that they interact with you with. And look, they get to stay Dave and not ticket number 1479."

(00:12:02):
That sort of thing. So that's how the pitch looks in the after. But that's a really different pitch. That pitch is designed to answer the question, "Why pick us over the other folks?" And so as you might imagine, it is a lot more effective at actually getting clients to get their head around, what is this thing? Why is it different? Why should I pick you? And it just works way better in a sales situation.

Lenny (00:12:22):
Awesome. So just to maybe summarize the framework 'cause you went through each of these pieces, and I think it might be helpful to give people the kind of steps. And I have them here, but maybe it might be better for you to kind work through.

April Dunford (00:12:33):
So you can think of it is... So first of all, the pitch structure has two big pieces. So the first is the setup. The setup piece is not about us, it's about the market, our point of view on the market. The second bit is all about our differentiated value. So why pick us over the other guys? So those pieces aren't equal. In a normal sales pitch situation, we don't want to spend all day in the setup part. We want to get to the meat, which is our differentiated value, but we can't skip that bit. So if I've got a half hour call or a 45-minute call, maybe I spend a few minutes on this upfront, this upfront stuff is really important though.

(00:13:12):
And we could break the upfront into three pieces. So it starts with our insight into the market. So you can think of this as our point of view on the market or kind of like the problem inside the problem, in some ways. So in Help Scout's case, the insight is, " Hey, customer service is just different for digital businesses, and this is really a growth driver, not a cost center. So we need to think about customer service in a different way." That's their insight. So we start with that.

(00:13:41):
The second piece is pluses and minuses of alternative solutions. What we want to do is paint a picture of the entire market and talk about what's good and bad of the other ways of approaching the job. And then out of that conversation, we have a conclusion, which is what I call perfect world. But just kind of like can we agree that if we really wanted to solve this problem and knowing what works and doesn't work in the alternate solutions, can we agree really good solutions should tick these boxes? This is getting the customer aligned with your worldview.

(00:14:14):
If they're aligned, then we switch to the follow through. The follow through has a handful of steps, but the main step is this differentiated value step. So usually what we'd start with is an introduction. "Hey, we're Help Scout. We do customer service stuff specifically for digital businesses." And then we would move on to, "Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it."

(00:14:37):
We generally end the sales pitch with a couple of little steps. So one is after we talk about the value, generally there's a step for proof, which is how can we prove that we do what we say we could do. Which is often a customer case study or it might be independent third party verification on stuff. But usually there's a proof step. There's an optional step after that, which is handling objections that haven't come up during the call. So sometimes we'll have a silent objection, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it sounds really hard to adopt." Or, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it's probably pretty expensive." Or, "Yeah, that's okay, but it probably doesn't meet our needs for security or whatever."

(00:15:15):
And so we handle that at the end in this special objection step. And then we end the pitch with what I call the ask, which is whatever we want the customer to do next. So it could be just asking for the sale or it could be, "Hey, we want to do a proof of concept. Who do we need to talk to about that?" Or, "Hey, we're going to do a project. Who needs to be involved in defining the project?" Whatever the next step is in your sales process. That's how we end is with dask.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Cool. I wanted to actually talk about objections. 'Cause I imagine going through this, companies often don't agree with what you're saying, and I wonder how you handle that. So you're going in this, do you agree? And yeah, the silent objection is really interesting. I don't even think about that, where they're just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we agree." But they don't really agree. How would you suggest people handle them being like, "No, I don't actually see the world that way." Or the silent objection, which I guess is something you save for the end.

April Dunford (00:16:09):
Typically when we're starting with insight, our insight into the market, if we're doing this well, the insight is generally not all that controversial. So you could think of it this way. So it's kind of the reason you built what you built. So most founders, when you talk to them, they didn't just come up with the idea out of nowhere. They woke up in the morning and said, "You know what sucks about email, this thing sucks about email. And so I'm going to build this different kind of email that solves that problem." Or in the case of Help Scout, it's like, do you know what sucks about customer service? It just wasn't built for these kinds of businesses.

(00:16:44):
And so if you've got a point of view on the world and you're talking to a customer that just fundamentally doesn't agree with that... In the case of a Help Scout, they come in and they say, "No, actually it's a cost center for us. We're just trying to get the cost down." They should disqualify that deal because they can't serve that customer better than Zendesk does. Zendesk is going to win that deal. But if you've done this properly, your insight should resonate for the target account that you're trying to go after. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be other objections, and usually there's all kinds of other objections. But the objections are more on a level of, if I can get you hooked at the beginning in this setup, then we go to the value, which is just proving I can do what we already agreed we wanted to get done. Then the objections tend to be more like operational stuff. "Yeah, this sounds good, but I don't know if we can forward it." Or "This sounds good, but boy, we're going to have to migrate off the old thing or whatever."

(00:17:40):
So mentally they're kind of sold already, but they're worried about, "Well, what's IT going to say? And can I actually get budget about this?" And in B2B, we've got this network of people that we've got to go get agreement from to move forward on this thing. And so often there's objections around that. The beginning of the sales pitch thing... One more thing on that is that part of what we're doing in that setup is what salespeople would call discovery. And so that setup part should not be me talking at you. It should be a conversation between me and the client saying, "Do you agree with this? Is this what you're seeing? Did you start with a shared inbox? What are you doing right now? Did you ever consider using help desk software? Why yes, why no? Do you have any constraints on what you're looking at? What have you tried before? What are you looking at trying right now?"

(00:18:31):
This is part of the discovery that we do in a first substantive sales call that your sales reps would know how to do this. Typically, one of the things we don't have in the pitch decks that I see in SaaS companies is there's no good place to do this discovery. So it kind of happens outside of the structure of the pitch. In this pitch structure, there's a definite spot for discovery. So by the time we get to the end of the setup, we should either be aligned like, "Yep, this looks like a good prospect for us. Yep, we can do something. Yep, they got a problem we can solve. This all looks good." Or we kind of jointly come to the conclusion, "Hey, this just... Our stuff just ain't for you, man." And that's it.

Lenny (00:19:13):
I mentioned a lot of this comes from doing this enough times. You get to understand where people generally agree, this is a problem. We all know this is our problem. And it's unlikely that you're going to have to throw everything out because someone just decides, "No, this isn't for us."

(00:19:29):
I think one of the biggest shift maybe from this framework is that you go into a teaching mindset. It's not just like, "Here's our product, it's going to solve your problem." It's more, "Here's what's happening broadly. Maybe you don't have the time to do the research we've done. Here's what we found." And then that builds trust, I think in you as a company and as a leader, a salesperson. And then they're like, "Okay, see, they see the world the way we do." Or, "I've just realized something new. I never thought of it that way." And then, "Okay, cool. How do they think about the solution to this?"

April Dunford (00:19:57):
Right. One of the key things to think about in all of this stuff that I think we don't think about enough as software vendors is that customers will come to us and they've done their homework. They've Googled around and they've looked at stuff, but that doesn't mean they have perfect understanding of the market. In fact, it's usually far from it. If we think about it, most of the folks in B2B software, most of the time, your buyer has never purchased software like yours before. This is the first time they've done it. And their bosses come to them and said, "Hey, figure this out. Go find us a CRM and look at all the CRMs and figure it out."

(00:20:33):
And the buyers looking at it going, "Geez, I don't know, man. There's a lot of CRMs out there, and I'm looking at all the things. I'm on G2 Crowd and there's 24 CRMs in the top right corner. And I'm looking at Gardner Group and I'm looking at this thing and I'm actually doing my research, but I'm overwhelmed. What I don't have is a clear picture of the market. What are the different approaches to this problem? Forget about products. What are the approaches to the problem? Where do the products fit in those approaches? What's a good solution for me look like? What should be my purchase criteria?" That's really hard for buyers to figure out.

(00:21:10):
And in general, in a sales process, we're not doing anything to help the buyer figure that out, even though we know it. We eat, sleep and breathe this market. We spend all day looking at competitors and thinking about this stuff and whatever. But we've got this idea, "Well, we shouldn't do this because first of all, we can't talk about the other guys that we'd be seen as bashing our competition, and that's bad." The other thing is, even if we did give our opinion, nobody would trust us because we're biased. But if you look at the research on this stuff, the research doesn't support that. The research actually says what B2B software buyers want in a sales interaction is perspectives on the market and help weighing their options. And we don't do that. We're just like, "Here's our stuff. You figure it out, it's up to you. You figure it out."

(00:22:03):
And so as a result, what we get are these buyers come in, they're overwhelmed with all this information. They come in and they sit in our sales process, and we overwhelm them even more with more features and more information. And what they're really worried about is, "What if I make a bad choice here? I've never done this before and I'm going to have to recommend to my boss. And if I make the wrong suggestion to my boss, maybe my boss thinks I'm stupid. Or maybe I buy something and the whole department hates me because awful to use. Or maybe I pick something and it's just bad software and then bad things happen for the business, maybe I get fired."

(00:22:40):
And so the data on this shows that for B2B, 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. And then when you look at, if you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of the...

April Dunford (00:23:00):
The old thing we were doing is better, that's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it," because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:23:23):
I think this is one of the most interesting insights that you share in your book and you also share this in the newsletter post about how buying software you could argue is harder than selling it because people will have learned there's skills and training for selling, but buying is, as you described, extremely stressful. Basically your job's on the line if you make a mistake. Is there anything more you can share along those lines just to help reinforce that buying software is extremely hard and stressful and people don't understand that?

April Dunford (00:23:50):
Once you get into that mindset, I think then you look at the situation a lot different. I think we've seen the statistics on this that says the buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying, "Nope, I'm not buying nothing." And in fact that's true 60% of the time. And so how do we combat that? The way we combat that is not just talking about ourselves, it's actually about trying to be helpful to that person in this very stressful situation that is trying to figure out how do I make a really good decision.

(00:24:27):
So what we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, "Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us. And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets." And so you can just think of it that way. So you don't need to know every single feature, every single thing. I'm giving you a bigger picture of the whole market and helping you feel good. Well, if you choose this or you choose that, now you know why.

Lenny (00:24:57):
I think what's interesting about this is a lot of startups fail because they can't convince anyone to switch from the status quo. And I think people always think of that as the current product is good enough and that's why they're losing, but I think this adds an additional wrinkle of it's also the person buying it is just like, "I don't want to add the stress to even decide and make the choice and put my butt on the line to switch." And I never thought of it that way.

April Dunford (00:25:22):
I think that hurdle is a lot more than you think. So we obviously have to compete with status quo, we can't ignore status quo, because sometimes status quo just is good enough and so we can't ignore that. We still lose deals to status quo, but we lose an awful lot of deals to just plain customer indecision, customers being more afraid of screwing up than missing out.

Lenny (00:25:46):
So to try to overcome that, to drill into the things you find most powerful, one is help the customer understand the bigger picture and why essentially they're falling behind, why maybe competition is going to have an advantage because they're thinking in a different way.

April Dunford (00:26:04):
Well, I'll throw something out about that.

Lenny (00:26:06):
Please.

April Dunford (00:26:10):
And I've heard people talk about this a lot that one of the things we could do in this situation when a customer is feeling this indecision is to lean into this FOMO and say, "Look, you're missing out. The competitors are all doing it and you're not doing it." And so this is an interesting question. And so I was super excited, Matt Dixon wrote this book called The JOLT Effect, and in that they studied two and a half million sales calls, they recorded on Gong and they studied it with AI, and then they looked at what happened after the sales call, so were these successful or not successful, did a deal happen or whatever. It's pretty rare that we get a chance to dig into some data like this.

(00:26:49):
And so what his data showed is if a customer is indecisive, throwing FOMO into the mix makes it worse. So they're less likely to close the deal if you throw that in. And the idea is that they're already stressed out and you're just putting more stress on them by pressuring them, by saying, "Oh, this is happening, bad things are going to..." You're like, "Bad things will happen if I do something, bad things happen if I don't do something, what do I do?"

Lenny (00:27:22):
They just put their head in the sand, right? They're just like, "Ah, forget it."?

April Dunford (00:27:24):
So they're just like, "Forget it, I'm doing nothing. Now I'm totally paralyzed." And so there's an assumption that companies are very motivated by this FOMO thing, but I think that that is not always true, and if the customer is actually indecisive, throwing in this FOMO thing isn't going to do it. So what does work in that situation is, one, giving them the tools to make the decision. So that includes paint the picture of the market, teaching them how to buy essentially. So teaching them, look, for customers like you, you just have to worry about these three, four things, and all this other stuff, it doesn't apply to you. That applies to bigger companies, that applies to whatever, so this idea of teaching a customer how to buy is one way to take that stress down.

(00:28:08):
And then there's a whole bunch of other techniques you can use. So one is if it's a really big deal, we can split it into smaller pieces, we can do things like offer you a money back guarantee, we can do things like sometimes we have services and support that are going to help you if things go bad and this is how we're going to make sure. So this idea of being able to take risk off the table is a really serious one if we've got a customer that is actually paralyzed because of this indecision thing.

Lenny (00:28:36):
That makes a lot of sense, basically it's like how do we help the buyer cover their ass if they made a mistake, because what you're saying is that's the main reason they're not buying your product.

April Dunford (00:28:43):
And this FOMO thing is just not going to do it.

Lenny (00:28:43):
That's so interesting. So I really like this framework. I wrote this down, teaching them how to buy, that is a really simple way of just thinking about this whole process.

April Dunford (00:28:53):
Well, it's funny, I was having this conversation with Bob Moesta, he did Jobs To Be Done.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Yeah, I watched that episode.

April Dunford (00:29:00):
So he's just the best. And so one of the things I think of is normally when we come at this we're like, "Well, how can we convince the customer that we do the job that they need to have done?" And obviously we need to do that, but there is this secondary job that the champion of the deal is, and that's how do I make a decision without getting fired? And so we got to help them accomplish that job, otherwise we don't get what we want, which is the money.

Lenny (00:29:28):
It's so interesting. And it's not even necessarily get fired, it's even the performance sufferers or they don't get the promotion, it's did they do a good job. This makes me think of a process at Airbnb we went through to buy community forum software and I just remember these massive teams of salespeople come to the office and pitching everyone on the software and they just keep pushing you to make what's the next step here, who do we need to roll in, who needs to buy into it? And it's just like, "Oh my God, it's so stressful. I have to keep this thing moving." And then there's IT coming in like, "Oh, we got to make sure it integrates with Salesforce." And you start with I just wanted the best community forum software because we were trying to build something really different and unique and you end up with like, "Okay, it's fine, just go with the thing that works with Salesforce. It's all good. I'm just going to move on to another process."

April Dunford (00:30:15):
Well, this is the thing, it's so easy to default to the market leader in that situation. The market leader has this big advantage that you can say, "You know what? Who's going to get me in trouble for picking Salesforce? Nobody." It's so easy to just flip back on that. And so if you're the challenger in this situation, the brand that's number two or number three, you've got to get over all of this inertia and tilting towards the status quo, because it's just so easy, it's the lowest risk decision, besides do nothing is to just pick the leader in the market and we'll just run with that.

Lenny (00:30:49):
I think the classic phrase was no one gets fired for buying Microsoft. I wonder is it Salesforce now that's the default version of that now?

April Dunford (00:30:55):
Yeah, the original one was IBM. [inaudible 00:30:57]

Lenny (00:30:56):
I think you're right. Oh, man.

April Dunford (00:30:59):
Now you totally get fired for buying IBM. I don't know what happens. The other thing you bring up is I think an interesting thing to think about too that really messes people up in these situations is that in B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen and so there's this complexity we don't have a consumer, but a lot of people I think overcomplicate that. In a typical B2B purchase process, we've got someone in that buying team is what we would call the champion. So that person is the person who's been tasked with, hey, pick us the accounting software or pick us the CRM, you figure it out. And so that person is the person that does the initial research, makes the short list, probably sits on the first calls, and then there's all these other people.

(00:31:49):
Now, the other people can't make a deal happen, but they can kill it a thousand ways. So the way this works is your positioning and your pitch needs to really work for the champion, because if it doesn't, you don't even get to talk to anybody else, you don't even get to go near anybody else if you don't make it out of the shortlist and you don't get the deal cooking. But once the deal is cooking it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups. So if you're the line of business buyer, let's say you're in the sales department and you're buying a CRM, IT is going to have to get involved at some point, and IT doesn't really care about the value of your CRM, but they do care does it meet the security requirements and does it integrate with the stuff we already have and how much of a pain is this thing going to be to manage, and so we're not actually pitching value to those people, we're just handling objections.

(00:32:46):
And so once we realize that, then we can get really tight on our positioning in our sales pitch. What we're really trying to do is just cook the champion, get the champion, and then once the deal's going we got to arm the champion for how to handle all these objections of all these other groups so that you can get a consensus to get a deal moving forward.

Lenny (00:33:05):
How do you actually do that? Is it ask them what are all the concerns you're hearing? Is it ask the individual stakeholders what your biggest concern is?

April Dunford (00:33:11):
Well, if we're really smart, we already know because we've done lots of deals. So if we're being a good partner in this, sometimes even in the very first meeting in that spot where we're talking about objectives, we're going to say, "Hey, look, IT is going to come in and they're going to be worried about this, this, and this, and don't worry, we got you."

(00:33:32):
So we're SOC 2 compliant, we do this, we do that, we know because we've done 15 deals and we know what these deals are like and we know what the stuff is going to be. You might have the champion come in and say, "Well, I don't know, end users might not like it." And it's like, "Okay, well, here's how we're going to get your end users on board, this is the training we have, this is the stuff we're going to do." The neat thing, if you have a product like [inaudible 00:33:54] on the front end of that, it takes that objection off the table. And you might have other things like you're going to take this to your boss and they're going to want to know ROI numbers, blah, blah, blah, and we've already done that, look, here's our calculator, if you give us this information, we can put this in, here's how you sell your boss.

(00:34:12):
So that's what we're doing. We're trying to arm them because we've done a million deals, they've never bought software like this before. So half the time you'll be doing deals and they don't even know what the purchase process is. And so if we're being good partners, we're like, "Okay, does this need to go to purchasing?" And they'll say, "Yeah, it probably does." Oh, well, here's what typically happens at purchasing. They're going to do this, this, this, and we're going to give you this stuff and that's going to help you get it through purchasing.

Lenny (00:34:40):
The way you're describing it now makes it feel like you need to be a big company for this to be useful because smaller companies don't have all these reps and they may not have the resources to do all these things you're describing. Who is this framework useful for? Can you use this approach if you're just, say, an early stage B2B?

April Dunford (00:34:53):
Well, so it's B2B products. If you don't have a sales team, I still think you can use this structure to build a story that marketing can use and you can use in different ways, and we can talk about that. But in the companies that I work with, they're B2B, they've got a sales team, and so the immediate thing we're doing is we're making a shift in positioning, we're building a sales pitch that reflects that positioning, we can immediately implement that in sales even though it's going to take a while for us to forklift the messaging and do other stuff and change our campaigns and everything else to match this new positioning, but we can tighten up the sales pitch and have an immediate impact over in sales on that. Second thing is that I've worked with tons of companies where the founder is the only sales rep and this works pretty good for that.

(00:35:39):
I don't think we need a ton of resources to do it, but I do think we need to have enough traction in the market that we understand how a deal typically goes. So if we haven't sold anything yet then we don't know yet, it's hard for us to help you buy something if we don't even know how to sell it. But if I've done 10 deals, I know what happens, I got a pretty good guess of what IT is going to say when you try to implement this stuff, I have a good guess of what's going to happen when we go to roll it out, I have a pretty good guess of what your boss might object to or might get excited by. And so I don't necessarily need a research team to go figure this out. This is just me trying to be helpful and help the champion do their job of getting this deal to the finish line.

Lenny (00:36:23):
So maybe the MVP of this approach is a deck that you continue iterating and adjust and restructure, and also bullet points of things you want to bring up like, "Okay, cool, IT is going to ask for these things," a few bullet points that you keep track of.

April Dunford (00:36:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I'm also thinking from the perspective of a product team building a product, they don't really sell it themselves. They work with sales, they work with marketing. Is there anything that you would recommend or that you think product teams could learn from this approach of selling that would help them build products in a different way or work with sales in a different way?

April Dunford (00:36:59):
Yeah. So here's what I think, the core of a good sales pitch is really deeply understanding your differentiated value, which is what is the value I can deliver that no other solution can. Often what I see at companies is you got a smart product team and they know a lot about the stuff they're building and why it's important and what the value is to the customer, and they did all this work on that when they were building it, but that information never made the jump to sales, because sales isn't even trying to pitch value. They're just pitching features like here's the dropdown menus, here's what they do. And so the first step in fixing this I think is to have a cross-functional team work on positioning.

(00:37:43):
So if I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product, deeply understand what's differentiated about it, deeply understands value, and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are, what the champion really wants to get done and doesn't want to get done, what the situation is in a typical account, and then all of this cool information sharing happens, which actually you end up with way better definition of your differentiated value in the first place.

(00:38:22):
And so once we've done that work, it is very natural then for us to work together on the sales pitch that reflects that. What typically happens is not that at all. What typically happens is product's working on some stuff, sales is working on some stuff, marketing's working on some stuff. Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, "I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see," and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.

Lenny (00:38:57):
That's a long time. So first podcast episode was all around positioning, and so folks want to get deep into that, they should listen to that, so we're not going to spend tons of time there, but differentiated value is a big part of this process also so I think it's worth spending a bit of time here. Could you maybe share a couple examples of what this is to give people a sense of what does it mean to share differentiated value?

April Dunford (00:39:20):
Yeah. So differentiated value is the answer to the question why pick us over the other alternatives? And so the way we get at that in positioning is we start with putting a stake in the ground of who do we actually compete with? And so if we didn't exist in the market, what would a customer do? And so typically there's some status quo thing, it might not even look like you, it might just be a spreadsheet, or do it with the intern or manual labor, and then there's whatever else ends up on a short list against us. And it's basically the definition of I got to beat all this plus indecision in order to win a deal, so I can stick my stake in the ground. Sales knows the answer to this question. If you have a sales team, they know the answer to this question, what would a customer do if we didn't exist, they know.

(00:40:06):
And then we get to the next step is, well, so what do we have that's different? And that's capability wise, feature function of the product or capability of the company, so it could be features, it could be your pricing model, it could be we have support in a way that the other folks don't. So there's all kinds of things it could be. It could be be the breadth of the portfolio that you have beyond that one product, we can fill whiteboards with this stuff. And then what we do is we go down that list of features and we say, "So what? You got advanced AI, whatever the heck the thing is, so what? Why does anybody care?" And the answer to that so what is your value. And because it came from this differentiated feature, it's generally value that the other guys can't deliver because they don't have the capabilities that underpin it.

(00:40:53):
So if I give you an example, a company I worked with a few years back, they've recently been acquired by Salesforce called LevelJump, and so they're in the sales enablement space, which is terrible. There's a million companies in the sales enablement space and they all look the same. And so LevelJump, so if you look at, well, what's the competitive alternatives, if I look at all the companies in the sales enablement space, you can put them into two buckets in terms of approaches, they're either a CMS like a jazzy content repository where you could make sure that people are using the right content and whatever, or they're an LMS, a learning management system, which I can build the course and certify you on the course, and that's how we're going to train the sales reps.

(00:41:39):
If you look at LevelJump, they're differentiated capability is they're the only one that's built on top of Salesforce. That's the feature, we're built on Salesforce, the other folks aren't. And then who cares? So what? And so when we first had a conversation about it, there was five or six different answers to that so what question, but the big answer was, well, because we're built on top of Salesforce, my sales enablement data is integrated with my sales data. And then you say, "Well, so what about that?" Well, because then that means I can actually tell did the sales enablement improve time to first deal or improve time to make quota? Well, so what about that? Well, if I improve that ramp time, then we get way more revenue faster. So that's the differentiated value.

(00:42:29):
When I go to do that in a sales pitch, I can translate that into my insight. My insight is every day your rep's not making [inaudible 00:42:36] it costs you money. So if we really want to solve sales enablement, don't we really want to have something where we can measure whether or not the sales enablement is working with sales metrics? Yeah, we do.

Lenny (00:42:47):
Interesting. So the differentiated value often informs the insight that you start with?

April Dunford (00:42:52):
It does. It absolutely is. The insight is basically the context that makes your differentiated value important, what is the thing you need to know to understand the importance of my differentiated value? In the case of Help Scout, the insight is, look, digital businesses like customer service is a growth driver, where does that come from? If you look at their differentiated value, it's there. And so we can just reverse it, flip it around. Even if the product wasn't necessarily constructed with that insight, maybe we got there sideways or the roundabout way or whatever, we iterated our way into that. We can look at the differentiated value and then basically reverse it out to the insight.

Lenny (00:43:33):
What's a sign that the differentiated value or insight that you've come up with just isn't clicking?

April Dunford (00:43:37):
If the differentiated value doesn't work in a sales pitch, what you'll get is the company going, "Why would I pay for that? This is not value for me, buddy." The companies I work with, the way I look at it is if you're in market and you're selling and you have happy, engaged customers, there's differentiated value there. That's why they picked you. That's why they love you. That's why they don't turn out on you. It's there. You might not know what it is, we might have to do a little process to get at it, but it's there and it exists.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Awesome. Another question that's been in the back of my mind since we started talking about differentiated values is just how honest should you be about the competition? Obviously there's a spectrum of extremely honest to super biased, what's your guidance on just how honest to be there?

April Dunford (00:44:34):
The posture I think you should assume in a sales situation, I had an old boss used to talk about this, is the posture we should have is calm confidence. So where that calm confidence comes from is we really understand why people should pick us. So this is differentiated value, we really understand it and we really understand who that's a really good fit for, and we don't even bother trying to chase anybody else.

(00:45:03):
So we should be able to come in and say, "Look, we're sales enablement that delivers results. If you don't care about those results, you shouldn't pick us. You should pick someone else." And so generally what we're trying to be is extremely honest. We're trying to come in and actually give credit where credit is due with the other approaches, because typically the other approaches work just fine for other kinds of companies. If you're really small and you're not growing e-commerce business, use a shared inbox. It's free, it's easy to use, there's no problems there, just use it. If you're really worried about bringing the cost down in a customer service center, maybe you should use Zendesk. And so I think the more we can act as a guide in this situation and come in and say, "Look, these guys are good for this, these folks are good for this, and we're good for this. And you might not care about that, and if you don't care about that, we're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us." But I think that...

April Dunford (00:46:00):
We're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us. But I think that this calm confidence idea is that where we know the client should pick us, we should be unafraid to fight for that business. But we should totally walk away from business where we're not the best fit. We shouldn't be chasing that business at all.

Lenny (00:46:20):
And this comes back to teaching them how to buy again and again. For these cases where you're like, "This is not a fit." Ideally you know that before you fly to their office and pitch them.

April Dunford (00:46:29):
Yeah, generally you've had some kind of qualification happen upstream, and so that qualification could be done in lots of different ways. If you've got some kind of product like growth motion in the beginning, you're looking for signals in that. And if the signals aren't there, then you're not talking to them. And so if you've designed your signals right, then you already know there's intent there. You already know you're a fit. You already know stuff. The way a lot of companies do this is they'll have inside sales do a qualification call before they set up a first call with a sales rep. In that qualification call, you're trying to make sure is this the right person? Do they have a need that we can actually meet? Is this actually a good fit for what we do? And if they're not, they don't even make it to the call.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Mm-hmm. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B1B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q3, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.

(00:48:09):
Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:48:32):
Another question around this idea of differentiated value and just alternative approaches is there's a certain previous guest who was very big on creating a category being extremely important, and that potentially being the only way to build a legendary business. I know you have a different perspective on that because in theory if you go that direction, there's no alternative. It's like "We're the one." What's your take on that?

April Dunford (00:48:55):
Well, so here's a few things. So one, obviously creating a category is not the only way to create a legendary business because the vast majority of legendary businesses did not create the categories that they're in. So Google did not create search, Facebook did not create social network. There's so many of them. It's actually more of an exception to the rule that the company is creating a category than the other way around. So I think it's a bit disingenuous to say the only way. It is a way to build a big business, no question about that. But it's absolutely not the only way. In fact, it is not the most common way, but it is a way and it does work. So that's one thing. The second thing is that category creation is interesting. Like most companies, if you look at their arc, even the category creators that are successful, they did not start out as category creators.

(00:49:53):
So they started out as a niche play in an existing category, and that's because that's generally the easiest way to get traction for a company early because what is the job of the market category? The job of a market category is to help answer the question, what is this thing all about? If I'm positioning an existing category, I can say, "Well, I'm CRM for very small businesses." That was Salesforce's initial positioning. I didn't have to explain to you what a CRM was, that already existed. There was already billion dollar company in that space. We know what a CRM is, and I could say "We're CRM for very small businesses. The reason you can use in this very small businesses is we don't have any software. So you don't have to have an IT department to babysit it. It's fantastic."

(00:50:34):
So most companies start there. Now what happens is that if you become the dominant player in that space, which again, category creation folks talk about this like no category creator has ever lost the market. In fact, most category creators wins their market. Like what happened to MySpace? What happened to Ask Jeeves? It didn't work out so good for them. Most category creators actually get overtaken by fast followers. So if we look at the CRM market, Siebel was the big dominant player there and now they're not. So now we've got Salesforce. Once you're the dominant player in that market, a cool move to do is to actually extend the boundaries of the category so that you can continue to grow. And most of the category creation examples we see are companies that when they were 200, 300, 400 million revenue dominating their space, then decided to move the goalposts and say, "Well actually now we're expanding into all these other areas and we're going to call this category something. And that's what it is."

(00:51:38):
And there's loads of examples of that. Like Qualtrics for example, is a company that a lot of people talk about very successful category creation. Well, they were survey software up until there were 300 million revenue just like everybody else in an existing category. So that got them there and that worked just fine. Oh, well, once we're dominating it, now we can say it's whatever, it is, customer experience software, whatever it is. Snowflake. Another good example like data warehousing in the cloud, they were that data warehousing, an existing market, were data warehousing for the cloud. That is not category creation. And that took them all the way up to the point where they were about to go public and now they're cloud data, which is their attempt to expand and say, "Well, it's not just data warehousing, it's actually data lakes and all other data stuff."

(00:52:22):
And so that's a smart move for them because they're now very well known in that space. I'm not saying category creation is a bad thing. There are examples of company that came right out of the gate and successfully created a category and then survived to own the category longer term. But a more common thing that happens is that the company does the hard work of creating the category and in exactly the moment where the category starts to take hold, fast follower can come in with fresh funding and a lot of it and learn from all your mistakes and come in and knock you off the peak right when you think you've made it.

(00:53:01):
So I think category creation is, again, it's good, it works, but I think we have to be very careful when we're thinking about doing that at an early stage business or a business that isn't already dominating the category that they're in. It's much more common to see companies come in, shave off a piece of the market, dominate that, and then successfully branch out. It's what Jeffrey Moore called bowling pin strategy. Almost all successful companies follow bowling pin strategy.

Lenny (00:53:29):
Wait, what is that? Let's touch on that real quick.

April Dunford (00:53:31):
Oh yeah, you remember that thing. It's funny how many times I've talked about bowling pin strategy in the last two months. So this comes from a bunch of work that was done around the way innovation gets adopted, blah, blah. So there's a bunch of research done on this stuff, and I'm going to misquote it because Jeffrey Moore stuff, I've been reading it for decades. But bowling pin strategy goes like this. The easiest way to take over a great big market is to define a segment of the market that is underserved by the market leader.

(00:53:59):
And so if you think about a bunch of bowling pins, we're going to circle around the lead pin, which is this little piece of the market that's easy for us to go get, and the market leader probably doesn't care about it. And so we knock over that pin and knocking over that pin enables us to get to the three pins right beside it. And so now I'm established here as a beachhead and I can go get the next three pins, I'm going to knock those over, and eventually I get big enough to challenge the market leader and then I overtake them.

(00:54:28):
So the example for my early career was I worked at this company, we thought we were enterprise software. We narrowed it down to CRM for investment banks, and so we literally drew bowling pins for our investors and said, "Lead pin is CRM for investment banks. Once we knock that over, then we're going to go to retail banking, then we're going to be CRM for banking. And then once we knock that over, we're going to go to insurance, then we're going to be CRM for financial services. Once we knock that over, then we're going to be a great big company and we're going to challenge Siebel to be CRM for enterprise software." Instead we got acquired by Siebel for like $1 billion, but whatever. So most companies, if you look at the history of them, they actually start that way. And so yeah, if we just fast forwarded to when they were 300 million, we can say "Category creation's the only thing to do," but it's like, well, what happened before then? That was something different.

Lenny (00:55:21):
Awesome. Let's come back to your framework. I'm looking at the list of bullet points. So we've covered a lot of this already actually. So there's the insight where you helped them understand what's happening in the world and what's changing and why this is important. Then you talk about what the alternative approaches might be, pros and cons. Then there's this third step, which we haven't talked about yet, which is sharing the perfect world characteristics of a perfect solution. Can you talk a bit about that and why that's important?

April Dunford (00:55:47):
So this is the conclusion of the setup phase. So if I'm Help Scout for example, the conclusion is we say, "Look, you really want customer success software that's as easy to use as an inbox. You're never going to outgrow it, but it was built from the ground up to be deliver an amazing service." And so it's this part of the pitch where we actually get agreement with the customer that we are aligned in terms of our point of view on the universe. So it's where I say, "Okay, we've had our little discussion about the pros and cons of the other alternatives," and we say, "So look, so are you with me, man? Can we all agree that a really good solution for you would have A, B and C?" And the customer is either like, "Yeah, right," or they're not. And so if they're right with you on this definition of the perfect world, then I've got you. I've already won the deal and I haven't even talked about us yet because the way I've set it up, I'm the only one that can deliver that.

(00:56:49):
So if you say, "Right," all I got to do is prove that I can do that and get you over the hurdle that it's possible for you to adopt it.

Lenny (00:56:59):
Sounds too easy.

April Dunford (00:57:01):
Yeah, I mean...

Lenny (00:57:02):
It's like you lure them in.

April Dunford (00:57:04):
If all of this was easy, Lenny we would be on a beach drinking out of a coconut.

Lenny (00:57:09):
Oh man, let's make it happen. Okay, so that's the setup. What do you call the second part again?

April Dunford (00:57:14):
It's the follow through-

Lenny (00:57:14):
The follow through.

April Dunford (00:57:15):
... which is really focused on differentiated value. So in the second part, the first step is usually we introduce our stuff, which is where the market category is important. So we come in and we say, "Okay, can we agree that a really good solution should tick these boxes? Yes. Okay, good. Now let's talk about us. Okay, so we believe that. That's why we build what we build."

(00:57:36):
So here I am, I'm Help Scout, we're customer service software for digital businesses or whatever our market category is. So we introduce it just to get people straight in their mind about what it is, and then we move to here's the value, here's how we do it. If we think about a typical sales call, like let's say a sales call is half an hour, 45 minutes, I would expect to spend more than half of the time in the sales call in this differentiated value phase. So if we're doing a demo, that's the demo, and we're saying, "Okay, step one, let me show you how we do this. So easy to use as an inbox. Here's the features. Never have to outgrow it, here's the features. Delivers amazing customer experience, here's the features." And so that's where we're getting to the meat of what you thought you were getting when you clicked on the button that said, "Give me a demo."

(00:58:25):
So that's what we're doing there. And then we end with these three little pieces. One is generally I got to show you some proof that I can do what I say I can do. So if I'm claiming this thing delivers an amazing customer experience, how do I prove that? Well, I can prove it by other customers saying it was amazing. That's one way to prove it. If I had some independent third party data that proved whatever I was claiming, I could show that there too. But a lot of times what we're doing is we're like, "Let me show you how this worked in a company that used our stuff. So this is what the before looked like. They did this thing, here's the after." And so customer case study is usually good way to do that, but there's usually a step called proof, which is, I showed you the value, now here's the proof that I can actually deliver on that value and it's not just me blowing smoke.

(00:59:16):
And then the step after that then is this optional objection step where they say, "Oh yeah, sounds good, but IT is never going to go for it," or "Sounds good, but maybe it's going to be too expensive," or something. And so you're going to handle that objection as best as you can. And then you finish with the ask, which is whatever the next step in your sales process is. So it's, "Hey, so what we have to do to get a deal cooking here, do we have to get IT involved? Does IT need to see it? Would you like us to come in and present with you with IT or do you want me to just help you work on some stuff for IT?" It's whatever your next step in the sales process is.

Lenny (00:59:56):
Awesome. So let me read through this just to have it also succinctly here in case people are taking notes or trying to remember the stuff. So there's the setup, there's the follow through. Within the setup, you have the insight, the alternative approaches, pros and cons, in the perfect world. And then you introduce your product, talk about the differentiated value, share the proof of why it works, potentially handle objections, silent objections, and then the ask of what comes next.

April Dunford (01:00:21):
That's right. That's it.

Lenny (01:00:22):
In terms of knowing if this is working and if your differentiated value works or if your insight works, do you have kind of a heuristic of a success rate that feels right? How often should this work for you to feel like "I think we have it?"

April Dunford (01:00:34):
Well, so generally if the sales pitch isn't working, it's because the positioning was weak.

(01:00:41):
And so companies that jumped straight to building the new sales pitch without going back and really making sure that they really nailed the differentiated value, who knows? Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. And a lot of times it doesn't, I think. And so in the work I do with my clients, we go all the way back to the beginning. So we go right back to let's work on the positioning first. Now, if I've got the smartest people from the company in the room and we've done enough deals that we are pretty knowledgeable about how customers buy and what they like and what they don't know. If I've got the senior executive team in the room and they've got a reasonable amount of customer experience, we can pretty much feel good that the positioning we come up with if we're following a process will be good.

(01:01:25):
Then it's just a matter of taking that positioning, mapping it to the sales pitch and then going to test it. So I think there's a bunch of things in testing that are really important. So one is we absolutely need sales involved in building the pitch. If we don't have sales involved in building the pitch, the pitch is never going to stick. The rule with sales reps is even if they don't like their current pitch, they're comfortable with the current pitch and they know it and they've memorized it and they have a little joke they tell on slide three. So they're not going to give up the current pitch without a fight. So you got to get sales management involved in building a new pitch, and then I would never just build the new pitch and then heave it over the wall and say, "Good luck, Chuck." Because what'll happen is they'll come up with all kinds of excuses why they can't use this pitch.

(01:02:07):
Instead, what you do is you take your best sales rep, your best one, and you bring your best sales rep over and you train them on the new pitch. They got to learn it, they got to pitch it to you, pitch it to the head of sales. We do a bunch of repetition on that, and then we have that rep test the pitch with qualified prospects. So we don't go to existing customers. They've already been polluted with the old positioning and the old pitch, and this needs to work with a qualified prospect, so let's do it in the way it was intended. We're going to take qualified prospects and work that new pitch with them. Usually what we'll do is a test period where after every pitch we'll huddle and say, "What worked? What didn't work? Maybe that word is tripping people up. Maybe we need to move this slide from here to here," and so we'll tune it.

(01:02:53):
And then after we've done a bunch of pitches, one of two things happens. And so in this test structure, I am very much relying on the expertise of my best rep to know what's good. So after the best rep is comfortable with the pitch, done a bunch of pitches, re-twizzled it, at some point the rep will say, "Okay, I think we're done optimizing this pitch, and I'm not going back to the old pitch. I'm sticking with this pitch because I think this one works better." An experienced sales rep will know that, whether the pitch is better than the old pitch, if you give them the opportunity to feel comfortable with it, work with it a bit and pitch a bunch of new prospects with it.

(01:03:38):
So if your best sales rep says, "Oh, this is way better than the old pitch. I can just feel it from the way people react to it and the number of times we've been able to convert people over into actual opportunities from a first call." Then what you do is at that point I call that pass. So then we take that rep, we can film them doing the pitch for training, and then we can take that rep, go back to the rest of the sales team and have that rep sell everybody else on it. So that rep goes back and says, "Listen up people, you're stupid if you're using that old pitch, which sucks. This new pitch is way better. Trust me, I'm the best rep on this whole team. By the way here's the list of deals I have cooking in the pipeline that I got using this deck. You should go do it and I'm going to teach you how to do it."

(01:04:24):
Now I got sales, teaching sales, teach and sales instead of marketing, sort of throwing something over the wall and crossing their fingers and saying, "Hey, I hope this works." What we should see is an immediate uplift in what happens after first call. So most of the time what that is we get a higher percentage of deals converting into opportunities after that first substantive calls. Sometimes depending on the quality of the pipeline we had coming in, we're actually disqualifying more. But sometimes that's a good thing.

(01:04:54):
But what we should see is an immediate uptick. It's stuff coming into the pipeline. It's a neat trick to pull, especially right now when everybody's budgets are really tight and you're just trying to squeeze more juice out of the lemon. It's a really easy way to get some more juice out of the pipeline. Just go in, tighten up your positioning, tighten up that sales pitch. And we can have instant impact with that because we can roll that out in a couple of weeks and start getting better deals flowing through the pipeline because these customers are understanding your value better, understanding why to pick you better. It's just easy, low hanging fruit to do when the economy's bad.

Lenny (01:05:32):
To give people a sense of maybe how easy that might be, how long would you suggest people spend on maybe tweaking their positioning and then also on this pilot, how much total time could it take to potentially significantly increase sales?

April Dunford (01:05:45):
So in the customers that I work with, when we do the positioning stuff, the positioning stuff takes a week. We're beginning and we're done in a week. We're all about speed on this thing. We're trying to get the thing happening fast. So we're in and out on the positioning in a week. It might take you, it depends on the company, the bigger the company, the slower this is, but some big companies are actually quite fast, and if you're motivated, it shouldn't take long for us to take that pitch and make it real.

(01:06:11):
Then we got to find a rep, train the rep, and then how long it takes us to test it really depends on how much deal flow you've got. So if you're working on monster deals and you don't actually get that many qualified prospects to pitch, that might take a few weeks. But if you've got a lot of prospects coming through the door, and you can get through this fairly quickly. So I've had companies do it start to finish. We got new pitch out the door and people using it in two weeks. That's about as fast as you can get it done. Most folks, I would say take about a month.

Lenny (01:06:39):
Cool. That is a very short-

April Dunford (01:06:40):
Sometimes you're like IBM and who knows when you get to it, right? But most folks could get through it if everybody's motivated, we can get it out and have it running a month.

Lenny (01:06:50):
You mentioned marketing and earlier you said that marketing is involved in this process in some way. What's your advice to just how to involve marketing, where they fit in?

April Dunford (01:06:58):
Yeah, so usually marketing is going to end up being the stewards of the positioning once the positioning is done. So they're going to end up being positioning police after this because a lot of the positioning stuff is going to take the form of marketing things. So they're invested in this. So when I was the VP marketing, I was the person that would instigate the positioning thing, let's get everybody together and work on the positioning. And then I would usually be the person that is driving, getting the sales pitch figured out, but it's me and sales and product working together. And then once the sales pitch is done, depending on the size of the organization and whether or not you have sales enablement or somebody inside sales that can babysit the pitch. Usually me and the head of sales would work on, "Okay, this is the pitch and this is locked down and we're not actually going to change this pitch until something happens that requires us to change the positioning. And then that's when we'll re-look at the pitch."

(01:07:55):
So we would look at recertifying the reps every quarter on the pitch and all that kind of stuff. And that would be generally, me in partnership with the head of sales. But it depends on how you do it. I don't think it really matters who owns it. If you have a good product marketing organization, good product marketing organization generally is very concerned with the positioning and the pitch, and those two things sit in their purview, but depends on how you define it. I can't wait till you get Airbnb. Tell us how this stuff works. They're different because they're a consumer, but companies are arranged in all different ways. So if you have product marketing, it looks one way. If you don't, it looks another way. Somebody's got to kind of be the owner of this thing though. And so we have to decide who that's going to be.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Just a couple more questions. One is to motivate people to do this. What kind of impact have you seen at companies that invest this time and rethink the way they pitch?

April Dunford (01:08:49):
Well, so people don't like me to talk about revenue stuff. Hugely what we've seen though is again, the immediate impact is felted sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that.

April Dunford (01:09:00):
Impact is felt in sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that. Because sometimes what the worry is, is we've got this old positioning and they came in through the pipeline that way. So they were exposed to our marketing somewhere with this old positioning, and then we hit them with the new positioning with this sales pitch. And aren't they going to be all like, "Oh, you moved my cheese." And usually it ends up not being a problem at all. So usually what we see immediately is an uptick in what's happening in sales. And so I've had a couple of companies tell me they've doubled the number of deals that they're bringing from first sales call to opportunity just by tightening up the pitch and getting that going. I think that's not unusual. I worked at a company where we did it in-house where I was the VP marketing, and we, within two quarters, had doubled the revenue just by tightening up the pitch. Just tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:53):
Holy shit. All right.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:54):
No big deal.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Yep.

Lenny (01:09:54):
Okay. So-

April Dunford (01:09:56):
It was a big shift in positioning, I'll tell you that. Not small. Most of the time, we're not doing that. Most of the time, it's a tightening. We're not saying, "Oh, we used to be this and now we're this." Most of the time, it's a tightening, but usually the pitches are so bad. I'm telling you they're so bad that there's this low hanging fruit there that if we could improve it even a little bit, it actually has this big impact on how much stuff survives down the pipe.

Lenny (01:10:25):
And again, if folks want to go deep into the positioning step, your first book Obviously Awesome, is a great guide, and our first podcast episode goes through this. Plus you have a guest post in my newsletter where you give them a quick start guide. So there's so many tools to help you through this process.

April Dunford (01:10:38):
So many tools.

Lenny (01:10:39):
The other thought I've had in the back of my mind as we've been chatting is a previous guest, Andy Raskin, has a different framework, feels similar, but I know they're different. His framework starts with a shift that's happened in the world, and then here's who's going to win in the shift, here's who's going to lose. And then he goes into why this product is the best. What's your perspective on that approach versus this approach and the big differences?

April Dunford (01:11:01):
So the thing with that framework is I do think it works in certain conditions, but again, I think the conditions might be kind of edgy. So there's a couple of things that I think are lacking in that structure for a sales pitch. So the first one is there's actually no concept of differentiated value in that pitch, which for me is a giant miss. So in that pitch, it assumes that new is inherently valuable and old is inherently bad, and sometimes that's true. So sometimes there's just you versus the status quo and the status quo is some terrible old thing, some legacy thing or it's manual processes or something, and you're the only thing out there, then you can get away with that. But most of the time, we don't have that. Most of the time, there's multiple new ways of doing something and you just can't say, "Well, I'm the only new and the rest of you are old and bad."

(01:11:55):
So usually I've got to thread the needle. And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that for most companies, if we really understood customer and decision, old is good, it's safe, it's not risky. And does anybody ever say, "No, I'm not going to buy Salesforce. That's the old stuff,"? I just don't think that happens. So in a lot of cases, I don't think you can rely, it's lazy to say, "Buy this because it's new and new is better." Most of the time, the customers are going to want to know, well, what's better about it? Tell me what the value is that I can't get anywhere else. And you're going to have to get more specific than just saying, "Trust me, it's new and new is good." So that's the first thing. The second thing is this idea of starting with a trend. On the surface it looks kind of good, but the problem is often the trend is not unique to you. So everybody else sees the trend too. And so you are starting in a way that any of your competitors could start the same way.

(01:12:59):
I did this for years where I was taught to do problem solution. We would define the problem like a trend. We'd say, "Well, the change in the world." I was selling databases and I'd say, "Change in the world, data is exponentially growing." It's like, no shit. We all know that. All of my competitors could say that, and all of my competitors deal with the trend in the same way. So unless you have a particularly unique take on the trend, well, then it's not the trend at all really, is it? It's your insight into the trend. So I don't think trend is that great because it's not always unique to you. And ideally what we want is something that we can say that none of our competitors can. And typically a trend is something outside of our control. It's out in the world and everybody else can see it too.

(01:13:47):
So I don't think it's great. I think that structure looks a lot like the structure we use in a VC pitch or an investor pitch because we're talking about much longer timelines and we can say, "Look, the world is really changing and 10 years from now there's going to be chaos and destruction and the only one standing is us and therefore there is no competition." And because the timeframes are longer and we're talking about disruption of an entire market, which is pretty theoretical, we can get away with a lot of that stuff in investor pitch. In fact, we want to go there in investor pitch. Sales pitch is all about right now. Sales pitch is like, okay, I'm going to exchange my money for right now. You can't get too far into the future. Otherwise, all I'm doing is giving everybody a reason to delay, which they're likely to do anyway because they're indecisive about what they should do.

Lenny (01:14:39):
I feel like I need a debate version of this podcast where people come on and-

April Dunford (01:14:43):
I know, but here's the thing that I think people should think about when they're looking at all this stuff because it's terribly confusing if you're trying to figure this out. The one thing I really dislike about the category creation folks is they say that's the only way that you can be successful. And in general, that's just not true about anything. There's lots of ways to do everything. And so I think people should mess around with stuff. And for any of these frameworks, I think they should look at it and see if it works for them and their situation. And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

(01:15:16):
And I think they should steal things from wherever they can steal it and figure out what works in their own situation. My stuff, I like to think is a starting point, folks should use it as a starting point, but people shouldn't be slaves to it. There are lots of things that work at a market, and I think the only thing that we know for certain is that we can't say, "Well, this is the rule and it always works like this." If it was that easy, again, this wouldn't be so hard. We wouldn't have podcasts and newsletters and all kinds of things trying to figure this stuff out.

Lenny (01:15:49):
Extremely true. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

April Dunford (01:15:54):
Oh yeah. Lightning round. Oh gosh. It gives me stress. Okay.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Okay, question number one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

April Dunford (01:16:04):
Well, that's an easy question. So right now I'm really into Matt Dixon's work right now, which we've mentioned him a couple of times on the podcast, but Matt Dixon's new book called The JOLT Effect is really great just because there's all this data and the things that he discovered with that data, a lot of it go against what we would consider accepted sales wisdom. And so I think that book is full of juicy nuggets and everybody should look at it. His previous book, The Challenger Sale, and there was a companion book to that called The Challenger Customer. Those were also excellent and based on a deep set of research. And those books are older now, but what we see in The JOLT Effect is all the stuff holds true. All the stuff from The Challenger Sale has not changed in 10 years. So I think those books together are really cool.

(01:16:54):
The other one that I always recommend is the original book on positioning, which is the book by Ries and Trout Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. I have my copy of it, is dogeared. I probably read that book 100 times and I still see stuff in that book that I didn't see before. So I think if you really want to go deep on this positioning stuff, my book is the how to book. Their book is what is it in the first place book. And I think everybody that's interested in positioning should go read that.

Lenny (01:17:19):
Amazing. By the way, I have your first book somewhere behind me there. I don't know where it is, but it's there.

April Dunford (01:17:23):
I got mine right here so I can do this gag. There it is.

Lenny (01:17:23):
Nailed it.

April Dunford (01:17:27):
There's the new one, there's the old one.

Lenny (01:17:27):
The YouTube audience can see that trick that you've learned. Second question, what is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

April Dunford (01:17:36):
Oh man, I'm going to get in trouble for this. So you know Bong Joon-ho is the guy that did the movie Parasite?

Lenny (01:17:47):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:47):
So [inaudible 01:17:48] before Parasite, there was this book called, this movie called Snow Piercer. It's really old. I think it came out in-

Lenny (01:17:54):
I've seen that. Is that with the train?

April Dunford (01:17:54):
2013. Have you seen it?

Lenny (01:17:54):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:57):
So I love this movie so much. So recently I went on a train trip with my dad and before I went to the train trip, we got talking about trains. And then we all had to go watch Snow Piercer again. Like me and my daughter watching Snow Piercer. We're really into this movie. And it's funny, when it came out, I was working at a startup and the CEO came and said, "Seen any good movies lately?" And I was like, "Oh man, you got to see this movie Snow Piercer." And he went on a first date with a woman and he came back the next day and he was so mad. He was not just kind of mad. He was really mad at me. He was like, "That was the worst movie I've ever seen." I was like, "Dude, you should have told me you were going on a date. I didn't know."

Lenny (01:18:40):
Yeah, that is my experience with that movie. I did not enjoy it, but I think you have to go into it [inaudible 01:18:46]

April Dunford (01:18:46):
It's polarizing. You either think it's amazing or you're like, that was terrible. What did I just watch?

Lenny (01:18:52):
This explains your taste in movies. We learned a lot about you, April. That movie is something else.

April Dunford (01:19:00):
Did you see Parasite? That was amazing.

Lenny (01:19:02):
That was amazing. Very different. Not what I imagined. I didn't realize it was the same person.

April Dunford (01:19:06):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (01:19:08):
All right. Okay, cool. That's two movies for people to watch. I'm curious how people think of Snow Piercer.

April Dunford (01:19:13):
Be warned don't go on a date with this.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Oh man, I still think about that movie sometimes. Next question, what is a favorite interview question you like to ask people that you're interviewing? Usually this is for when you're hiring, so whatever this comes up for you.

April Dunford (01:19:28):
So back when I was running teams internally back in my VP marketing days, I felt like a lot of marketing folks came with a certain amount of bad habits, particularly startup marketing folks. It's a bit of the wild west in marketing. And so sometimes they'd come in and you get into somebody new and they'd be really smart, but they learned something at the previous company that you're like, please never do that here. It's not going to work here. And so I developed a thing where I was just looking for attitude. Were you enthusiastic? Are you super into what we're doing here? And I can teach you pretty much anything. The only thing I can't teach you is persuasive writing. And I think that's a learnable skill. I think people can learn how to do persuasive writing.

(01:20:12):
I just don't have time to teach it to you myself. And so I used to give people a writing test, so I'd say, "Look, think of something you bought recently and write me two paragraphs and just sell me on it." And I used to love that test because people could either do it or they can't. And there's just so much stuff we end up doing in product marketing and marketing that involves a little bit of writing that it's kind of a foundational skill. And if you don't have that, that was the one thing I couldn't teach you.

Lenny (01:20:42):
Wow, that is fascinating. I've never heard of that as an interview question. And I love it. I feel like product managers-

April Dunford (01:20:47):
I stole it from a company that made me do it before I got hired, and I was like, this is a really smart thing. I'm [inaudible 01:20:53] stealing it. My thing was I got anxiety and I couldn't decide what product to write about, and I had literally just bought a new pair of running shoes. So I wrote two paragraphs about my new Brooks distance running shoes. But it was good. I got the job.

Lenny (01:21:09):
It is an excellent segue to our next question, which is, is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

April Dunford (01:21:15):
Right now I'm kind of into, I don't even know how to describe this category of things, but things that are kind of low tech but are awesome. And so one of the category of things that I really love right now is I'm really into fountain pens. I don't know if you've ever written with a fountain pen. [inaudible 01:21:35]

Lenny (01:21:35):
I haven't, but I know what they are.

April Dunford (01:21:36):
And so there's this company, Lamy, they're based in Germany, and they make the world's greatest fountain pens. They're beautiful, they're amazing. Some of them are really expensive. If you want to spend a lot of money on a pen, you can. But they have this one called the AL-Star, which is not an expensive pen. It's 20, $30. It may be expensive for a pen, but it's not so much money that you wouldn't feel bad if you lost it. So Lamy AL-Star. That's my great product lately. I don't have one right here. I should, it'd be a great prop to pick it up, but I actually don't have my bag here and it's in my bag. But Lamy AL-Star. You Google it. These are beautiful pens. And then if you haven't written with a fountain pen, it takes a minute to get used to it, but then it's like, gosh, it just feels great. You'll never write with a ballpoint pen again.

Lenny (01:22:22):
I was going to ask, is it the feel of the writing that you really enjoy about it?

April Dunford (01:22:25):
Feel. Totally different. Yeah. Amazing.

Lenny (01:22:29):
I use Muji pens. I don't know if you know these pens.

April Dunford (01:22:31):
Oh yeah, these are actually really good. They're like roller ball pens, roller ball pen, very good, but not as good as the fountain pen.

Lenny (01:22:31):
It's no fountain pen.

April Dunford (01:22:38):
The Muji pen is pretty good.

Lenny (01:22:39):
Then do you have to dip it in ink and stuff? How does that work?

April Dunford (01:22:41):
No. You actually, they either come with a little cartridge that you stick in or if you feel bad about the environment, you don't want to be throwing out cartridges all the time, there's a refillable cartridge, so you basically just stick another thing and it sucks it up and yeah, you don't dip it in ink. That would be crazy. I can't take that on the airplane, man.

Lenny (01:22:58):
Confiscate your ink. All right, questions get a little more challenging potentially or really easy. Do you have a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, you like to share with people, that you find useful to come back to?

April Dunford (01:23:11):
My thing lately is, and maybe this is just an old person thing, but my thing lately is nothing's a big deal. Nothing's a big deal, nothing's a big deal. And so you'll have stuff that you think is a really big deal, positive or negative, and you'll be like, wow, if this thing happened, it'd be so great, and then it happens and you're like, yeah, it's pretty great, but things are good otherwise, or it'll be the opposite. Like, oh, if this thing happened, it'd be so bad. Then it happens and you're like, that wasn't that bad. And so I don't know if this is good or bad, but lately I'm in this zone of I'm in this kind of chill zone where I'm like, nothing's a big deal, man. Everything's cool.

Lenny (01:23:56):
That super resonates. And as much as you say that to yourself, it's still hard to convince yourself of that sometimes. But that is a really good motto. I'm going to steal that myself. I kind of say that to myself often in different way.

April Dunford (01:24:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:24:10):
What is the most valuable lesson your mom or your dad taught you?

April Dunford (01:24:15):
Yeah, it is funny because it's a little bit related to that. So my dad ran a business, so I grew up in a really small town and my dad and it's cottage country in Canada. And so my dad ran the local toys for tourists, like boats and motorcycles and ATVs and that sort of thing. And he ran that business for years and years and he sold it a few years back when he retired. But it's a neat thing to grow up in entrepreneurial family because you kind of see this highs and lows. The business is really good. Then the business was really bad and then we were all broke and then the business was good and we were not broke. So there was this thing, and my dad used to always kind of have this attitude of you just got to grind it out.

(01:25:01):
You're just going to grind it out. There's going to be good stuff, there's going to be bad stuff, but the key is to just keep going, just keep going. And so he ran that business for whatever, 30, 40 years. I don't know. His motto is the home of fun since '71. So he started it in '71. I think he sold it three, four years ago. So a long time.

Lenny (01:25:21):
Wow.

April Dunford (01:25:22):
It all worked out good in the end. And so I don't know, I think there's something cool about growing up in a family where you can see the highs and lows and then again be like everything's we're just grinding it out over here. Nothing's a big deal.

Lenny (01:25:34):
It's clear where all that comes from now.

April Dunford (01:25:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:25:37):
Final question. You do a lot of traveling, you do a lot of speaking, you go to a bunch of cities. I'm curious just what is your favorite either city that you go to that maybe people may not know about or venue that you speak at?

April Dunford (01:25:49):
It's such a cliche, but I love Paris. I just love it. But for me, Paris is like a particular vibe. So when I was in university, I did an exchange when I was in engineering and I did third year engineering at a school just outside of Paris. And so I spent the whole year there, learned a bit of French. My French was pretty good at the end. My French is really bad now. So I kind of get Paris. I like Paris. And so when I go to Paris, I just have the best time. I have my set of restaurants I want to go to. I have my handful of places I want to go shopping. I put my butt down in a cafe, look at the beautiful people, drink my nice coffee. I just really dig the whole vibe of Paris and people are starting to know that now. So French companies will call me and they'll say, "Do we get a Paris discount? We hear you like coming here." And I go, "Okay."

Lenny (01:26:50):
Now this is going to [inaudible 01:26:51]

April Dunford (01:26:51):
There's a great product management conference there called La Product Conference run by these folks at Tega, shout out to Tega. So I've been there a number of times for their conferences and they do an amazing job and the venue is really great. It changes around. But last year, the last time I went there, which was two years ago, it was at an old theater in [inaudible 01:27:13]. Absolutely beautiful. And that was a pretty great venue in a great city with a great conference. So yeah, shout out to French people.

Lenny (01:27:22):
Oh man. That sounds dreamy. Paris. I see how that could be a favorite. April, I think we accomplished everything we were hoping to accomplish. I think everyone that has listened to this podcast is going to be better at pitching and selling. It feels like even if they take one element of this framework, say starting with an insight or focusing on different value will make them better. And so I'm proud of us. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

April Dunford (01:27:50):
So where can people find me? I'm aprildunford.com. The only social media I'm doing these days is LinkedIn. I'm a bit social media-ed out. I'm experimenting a little on threads and Instagram, but LinkedIn is a good place to find me if you just want low lift way to follow my stuff. But I'm doing all the things now, Lenny, I got a podcast, it's called Positioning with April Dunford. I got a newsletter that's also called Positioning. You can find that if you go to, it's on Substacks, you can find it there, otherwise aprildunford.com/books and you can sign up there. But those are the big things. And then there's the books, obviously, if you want to learn more about this stuff. Everything I know is in the book. There isn't stuff that I know that isn't in the book to be honest.

Lenny (01:28:34):
Amazing. And then how can listeners be useful to you? Just check out those things.

April Dunford (01:28:37):
I guess so. You know what? I'm in this phase. I think, again, I think it's an old age thing. I am in this kind of philosophical phase where I'm not going to be doing this forever. And what I'm trying to do right now is get everything that's useful out of my head and out in the world before I'm done. And so right now I'm very focused on delivering useful things for other people. I didn't think I needed to write a book about sales pitches, but then I got the idea in my head, everybody's sales pitch is so bad and there isn't a book on how to build a sales pitch. And I'm not saying mine's the world's greatest thing, but it's better than nothing. So this is what I'm trying to do right now. I'm trying to be useful to other people because pretty soon I'm not going to be doing anything, I think is the idea.

Lenny (01:29:29):
Arnold Schwarzenegger's new book is called Be Useful. And I feel like that's the perfect description of how to be successful and especially in the work that we do, just helping people. But I keep coming back to that. It's just be useful.

April Dunford (01:29:41):
I think this is a really important thing. When I wrote the first book, people started writing back to me and saying, "Oh, your book was so great." And my reflex action was to say, "Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it." But then I stumped myself and I was like, you know what? I don't actually care if you enjoyed it. This isn't entertainment. I'm actually trying to create something that's useful. So what I really want is for people to read this stuff and come back and say, "That was useful. We were struggling with this thing, and that unlocked something for me and that was useful." And that's what I'm trying to do right now.

Lenny (01:30:11):
April, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing.

April Dunford (01:30:14):
Thanks so much. It's always good to be here.

Lenny (01:30:17):
Always good to have you here. And we might do a V3 when you do a third book if you ever-

April Dunford (01:30:21):
No, not happening.

Lenny (01:30:25):
Okay. All right. Well, bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

# How to nail your product positioning | April Dunford (Obviously Awesome)

## Transcript

April Dunford (00:00:00):
40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it." Because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:00:39):
Today. My guest is April Dunford. April is the world's foremost authority on product positioning. She's the author of the bestselling book, Obviously Awesome, which is my favorite book on positioning. And this is her second time on the podcast because she just published a new book called Sales Pitch, which builds on her 25-year career as VP of marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games and many others. The book guides you through a better way to pitch and sell your product. And in our conversation, April shares the framework that she has seen work most often in getting potential customers to get excited about your product and to decide to buy your product.

(00:01:16):
Like I say, at the top of this episode, you'll become better at pitching and selling your product by the end of this episode. And if that's useful to you, which it should be, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you April Dunford after a short word from our sponsors.

Speaker 1 (00:01:32):

Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, click up, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:03:04):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:03:47):
April, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast.

April Dunford (00:03:52):
So great to be back. We were talking about this earlier, but it feels like it was so long ago when I did the last one. I was one of the first guests and I feel like, man, you've been running this thing forever. And that was like a year ago.

Lenny (00:04:05):
It feels like a lifetime, but it was about a year ago.

April Dunford (00:04:08):
But what you've done with it is amazing, right? The growth in it, everything else, it's super inspirational.

Lenny (00:04:13):
Thanks April. I appreciate that.

April Dunford (00:04:15):
You're welcome. It's true though. I think everybody looks at your stuff and goes, "What the heck? How does he do it?"

Lenny (00:04:22):
The secret is a lot of work.

April Dunford (00:04:24):
Yes.

Lenny (00:04:24):
That's the get rich quick scheme there.

April Dunford (00:04:28):
Nobody wants to hear that.

Lenny (00:04:30):
Yeah. But it's work that's extremely fulfilling and we get to chat again and you are a very rare return guest, which makes me very happy. And the reason you're back is you've written an incredible new book, which I have right here if you're on YouTube called Sales Pitch.

April Dunford (00:04:44):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:04:45):
There it is. And it's in your background, too. It's like a inception. The book is called Sales Pitch, How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win. And we're going to be spending our time today digging into all of the lessons and frameworks in the book as much as we can in the hour that we have. And my goal for this conversation is for listeners to leave this podcast with better skills at pitching and selling their product. Which I think every product leader and founder will want to do and get better at. How does that sound?

April Dunford (00:05:13):
That sounds great.

Lenny (00:05:14):
Okay, sweet. I was thinking as a way to get into the conversation, we start with maybe a story or an example of a company that you worked with where you applied the frameworks and lessons they teach in the book. And then use that as kind of a jumping off point for digging in further.

April Dunford (00:05:30):
Yeah, sure. So my background is, I do positioning work. And so in the work that I do with clients, generally what we're working on is a shift in the positioning, which is a little bit of a shift in our thinking around, how do we win in the market? So in order to test that positioning, what we want to do is take the positioning and translate it into a sales pitch and then test it live with prospects.

(00:05:53):
And one of the things I noticed right at the beginning of doing this work is that everybody's sales pitch kind of looked the same and they weren't all that great. And for the most part what was happening in the sales pitch is there was no positioning going on in the sales pitch at all. The sales pitch was essentially a product exposition, so essentially a glorified product box room. If there was five dropdown menus, we're going to click on all five dropdown menus and show everybody everything just feature, feature, feature, feature, feature.

(00:06:24):
And so, most of the teams weren't used to doing any kind of pitching in the pitch really. It was just the facts Jack, were just going to show you that. Some would do this really lightweight thing. Here's the problem, we're the solution. Now let me walk you through all the dropdown menus, but it is basically the same thing like that.

(00:06:43):
And so what I wanted to do was build a pitch structure that would reflect the positioning. And so in order to do that, we have to get a little bit into storytelling mode. Not a lot, but at least a little. And when we're talking about features, we shouldn't be talking about features. We should be talking about the value that the features deliver.

(00:07:01):
So let me give you an example and I'll do before and after what this would look like. So I work with these folks, Help Scout, and so they're in the customer service space, so think Zendesk or whatever. They're in that space. And what's interesting about them is they were built from the ground up to serve digital businesses. So businesses that don't have a physical store, they don't have sales reps. And so their approach to customer service was different from the outset. Help Scout said, "Well, you know what? Customer service for that kind of business is really important. It's the only time you ever get to interact with actual customers." And so the data shows that if you give them a really great interaction in service, it improves loyalty, it improves repeat purchases, and it's actually a growth driver. Now, most folks in other industries see customer service as a cost center.

(00:07:49):
So your telephone company for example, wants to get you off the phone as fast as possible. And they want to push you to the self-serve FAQ channels, and they don't care about giving you a good service at all. They don't care about any of that. And so they're all about driving the cost down. So if we look at Help Scout in their positioning, the alternatives to Help Scout are a handful of things. Most folks start using a shared inbox and it's really easy to use and the reps love it. It's easy to use. The problem is, is you start growing and then you want customer service features. You want to be able to do assignments and prioritization and things like that. So then these customers end up upgrading to help desk software and now they're in this whole different world.

(00:08:31):
So the first thing is really hard to use. So we're not in shared inbox territory anymore. And the second thing is that there's this attitude of we're trying to push folks to low cost channels. We don't really care about them. We're going to assign you a ticket number. You're not a person anymore. All this stuff. So that's the situation. So Help Scout, if they did a typical pitch the way I see most SaaS companies pitch, they would just expose the features. Right? So the pitch would look like this. Digital business comes in and they say, "Hi, Help Scout, let me show you how to log in, let me show you all the features. Look, there's a shared inbox thing there that's really great. Oh, look, we can do assignments and prioritization and we can do this other thing and we can do this other thing and la, la la." And I keep going until the time runs out and I don't have any more features to talk about.

(00:09:20):
The problem with that pitch is the customer's sitting there going, "I don't know, man, that sounds a little bit like my shared inbox, but it also sounds like help desk software. Is it different than help desk software? I'm not so sure. And there's overlap in the features there." And so it doesn't really answer the question, why pick us over the other guys?

(00:09:42):
And so a different style of pitch would be one, we would do a little bit of setup to give everybody an idea about how we fit amongst all the other solutions and what our point of view is in the market. And then when we get to exploring the features, we would do that within the context of the differentiated value. So here's how that pitch would look like. Customer comes in and Help Scout says, "Hey, digital business, we work with a lot of companies like you, and I'm going to show you the product. But before we get there, one of the things we think is interesting is that digital businesses look at customer service differently. They look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center. And so most of the folks we work with see delivering a really amazing experience as a key part of customer service. Would you agree with that?"

(00:10:26):
Yeah, we would. They have a little conversation and then they say, "Great. We you have choices here. So most of the folks we work with start with a shared inbox, and that's great because it's really easy, really easy to use all that stuff. The problem is if you're growing and you probably are, then you're going to outgrow that because you're going to need prioritizations assignments, help desk stuff.

(00:10:45):
And so then your option is to go to help desk software. And so help desk software is great, does all the things. The problem is that it was not designed for businesses like you. It was designed for businesses that want to take the cost out of customer service. So it's going to do some things that are weird. It's going assign your customers a ticket number and it's going to try to drive them to low cost channels. So can we agree that in a perfect world for digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk, but had all the bells and whistles so we wouldn't have to migrate to something else. And on top of that was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service. Do we agree we want that?"

(00:11:26):
Now, at that point, the customer is either with you or you're not. But if they are, then we switch to the actual demo part. If we do a demo and then we say, "Great, we've got those three things. Let me show you how that works. So one as easy to use an inbox. Look, here's the inbox. It's easy to use. Looks just like an inbox. It's amazing. Two, features, so you never have to outgrow it. Look, here's how we do prioritizations assignments, whatever. We can do all the stuff you need as you grow, and you're never going to have to switch platforms. And then last one, deliver an amazing experience. Look, the customer gets to choose which channel that they interact with you with. And look, they get to stay Dave and not ticket number 1479."

(00:12:02):
That sort of thing. So that's how the pitch looks in the after. But that's a really different pitch. That pitch is designed to answer the question, "Why pick us over the other folks?" And so as you might imagine, it is a lot more effective at actually getting clients to get their head around, what is this thing? Why is it different? Why should I pick you? And it just works way better in a sales situation.

Lenny (00:12:22):
Awesome. So just to maybe summarize the framework 'cause you went through each of these pieces, and I think it might be helpful to give people the kind of steps. And I have them here, but maybe it might be better for you to kind work through.

April Dunford (00:12:33):
So you can think of it is... So first of all, the pitch structure has two big pieces. So the first is the setup. The setup piece is not about us, it's about the market, our point of view on the market. The second bit is all about our differentiated value. So why pick us over the other guys? So those pieces aren't equal. In a normal sales pitch situation, we don't want to spend all day in the setup part. We want to get to the meat, which is our differentiated value, but we can't skip that bit. So if I've got a half hour call or a 45-minute call, maybe I spend a few minutes on this upfront, this upfront stuff is really important though.

(00:13:12):
And we could break the upfront into three pieces. So it starts with our insight into the market. So you can think of this as our point of view on the market or kind of like the problem inside the problem, in some ways. So in Help Scout's case, the insight is, " Hey, customer service is just different for digital businesses, and this is really a growth driver, not a cost center. So we need to think about customer service in a different way." That's their insight. So we start with that.

(00:13:41):
The second piece is pluses and minuses of alternative solutions. What we want to do is paint a picture of the entire market and talk about what's good and bad of the other ways of approaching the job. And then out of that conversation, we have a conclusion, which is what I call perfect world. But just kind of like can we agree that if we really wanted to solve this problem and knowing what works and doesn't work in the alternate solutions, can we agree really good solutions should tick these boxes? This is getting the customer aligned with your worldview.

(00:14:14):
If they're aligned, then we switch to the follow through. The follow through has a handful of steps, but the main step is this differentiated value step. So usually what we'd start with is an introduction. "Hey, we're Help Scout. We do customer service stuff specifically for digital businesses." And then we would move on to, "Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it."

(00:14:37):
We generally end the sales pitch with a couple of little steps. So one is after we talk about the value, generally there's a step for proof, which is how can we prove that we do what we say we could do. Which is often a customer case study or it might be independent third party verification on stuff. But usually there's a proof step. There's an optional step after that, which is handling objections that haven't come up during the call. So sometimes we'll have a silent objection, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it sounds really hard to adopt." Or, "Yeah, that sounds really good, but it's probably pretty expensive." Or, "Yeah, that's okay, but it probably doesn't meet our needs for security or whatever."

(00:15:15):
And so we handle that at the end in this special objection step. And then we end the pitch with what I call the ask, which is whatever we want the customer to do next. So it could be just asking for the sale or it could be, "Hey, we want to do a proof of concept. Who do we need to talk to about that?" Or, "Hey, we're going to do a project. Who needs to be involved in defining the project?" Whatever the next step is in your sales process. That's how we end is with dask.

Lenny (00:15:44):
Cool. I wanted to actually talk about objections. 'Cause I imagine going through this, companies often don't agree with what you're saying, and I wonder how you handle that. So you're going in this, do you agree? And yeah, the silent objection is really interesting. I don't even think about that, where they're just like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, we agree." But they don't really agree. How would you suggest people handle them being like, "No, I don't actually see the world that way." Or the silent objection, which I guess is something you save for the end.

April Dunford (00:16:09):
Typically when we're starting with insight, our insight into the market, if we're doing this well, the insight is generally not all that controversial. So you could think of it this way. So it's kind of the reason you built what you built. So most founders, when you talk to them, they didn't just come up with the idea out of nowhere. They woke up in the morning and said, "You know what sucks about email, this thing sucks about email. And so I'm going to build this different kind of email that solves that problem." Or in the case of Help Scout, it's like, do you know what sucks about customer service? It just wasn't built for these kinds of businesses.

(00:16:44):
And so if you've got a point of view on the world and you're talking to a customer that just fundamentally doesn't agree with that... In the case of a Help Scout, they come in and they say, "No, actually it's a cost center for us. We're just trying to get the cost down." They should disqualify that deal because they can't serve that customer better than Zendesk does. Zendesk is going to win that deal. But if you've done this properly, your insight should resonate for the target account that you're trying to go after. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be other objections, and usually there's all kinds of other objections. But the objections are more on a level of, if I can get you hooked at the beginning in this setup, then we go to the value, which is just proving I can do what we already agreed we wanted to get done. Then the objections tend to be more like operational stuff. "Yeah, this sounds good, but I don't know if we can forward it." Or "This sounds good, but boy, we're going to have to migrate off the old thing or whatever."

(00:17:40):
So mentally they're kind of sold already, but they're worried about, "Well, what's IT going to say? And can I actually get budget about this?" And in B2B, we've got this network of people that we've got to go get agreement from to move forward on this thing. And so often there's objections around that. The beginning of the sales pitch thing... One more thing on that is that part of what we're doing in that setup is what salespeople would call discovery. And so that setup part should not be me talking at you. It should be a conversation between me and the client saying, "Do you agree with this? Is this what you're seeing? Did you start with a shared inbox? What are you doing right now? Did you ever consider using help desk software? Why yes, why no? Do you have any constraints on what you're looking at? What have you tried before? What are you looking at trying right now?"

(00:18:31):
This is part of the discovery that we do in a first substantive sales call that your sales reps would know how to do this. Typically, one of the things we don't have in the pitch decks that I see in SaaS companies is there's no good place to do this discovery. So it kind of happens outside of the structure of the pitch. In this pitch structure, there's a definite spot for discovery. So by the time we get to the end of the setup, we should either be aligned like, "Yep, this looks like a good prospect for us. Yep, we can do something. Yep, they got a problem we can solve. This all looks good." Or we kind of jointly come to the conclusion, "Hey, this just... Our stuff just ain't for you, man." And that's it.

Lenny (00:19:13):
I mentioned a lot of this comes from doing this enough times. You get to understand where people generally agree, this is a problem. We all know this is our problem. And it's unlikely that you're going to have to throw everything out because someone just decides, "No, this isn't for us."

(00:19:29):
I think one of the biggest shift maybe from this framework is that you go into a teaching mindset. It's not just like, "Here's our product, it's going to solve your problem." It's more, "Here's what's happening broadly. Maybe you don't have the time to do the research we've done. Here's what we found." And then that builds trust, I think in you as a company and as a leader, a salesperson. And then they're like, "Okay, see, they see the world the way we do." Or, "I've just realized something new. I never thought of it that way." And then, "Okay, cool. How do they think about the solution to this?"

April Dunford (00:19:57):
Right. One of the key things to think about in all of this stuff that I think we don't think about enough as software vendors is that customers will come to us and they've done their homework. They've Googled around and they've looked at stuff, but that doesn't mean they have perfect understanding of the market. In fact, it's usually far from it. If we think about it, most of the folks in B2B software, most of the time, your buyer has never purchased software like yours before. This is the first time they've done it. And their bosses come to them and said, "Hey, figure this out. Go find us a CRM and look at all the CRMs and figure it out."

(00:20:33):
And the buyers looking at it going, "Geez, I don't know, man. There's a lot of CRMs out there, and I'm looking at all the things. I'm on G2 Crowd and there's 24 CRMs in the top right corner. And I'm looking at Gardner Group and I'm looking at this thing and I'm actually doing my research, but I'm overwhelmed. What I don't have is a clear picture of the market. What are the different approaches to this problem? Forget about products. What are the approaches to the problem? Where do the products fit in those approaches? What's a good solution for me look like? What should be my purchase criteria?" That's really hard for buyers to figure out.

(00:21:10):
And in general, in a sales process, we're not doing anything to help the buyer figure that out, even though we know it. We eat, sleep and breathe this market. We spend all day looking at competitors and thinking about this stuff and whatever. But we've got this idea, "Well, we shouldn't do this because first of all, we can't talk about the other guys that we'd be seen as bashing our competition, and that's bad." The other thing is, even if we did give our opinion, nobody would trust us because we're biased. But if you look at the research on this stuff, the research doesn't support that. The research actually says what B2B software buyers want in a sales interaction is perspectives on the market and help weighing their options. And we don't do that. We're just like, "Here's our stuff. You figure it out, it's up to you. You figure it out."

(00:22:03):
And so as a result, what we get are these buyers come in, they're overwhelmed with all this information. They come in and they sit in our sales process, and we overwhelm them even more with more features and more information. And what they're really worried about is, "What if I make a bad choice here? I've never done this before and I'm going to have to recommend to my boss. And if I make the wrong suggestion to my boss, maybe my boss thinks I'm stupid. Or maybe I buy something and the whole department hates me because awful to use. Or maybe I pick something and it's just bad software and then bad things happen for the business, maybe I get fired."

(00:22:40):
And so the data on this shows that for B2B, 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. And then when you look at, if you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, "Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better." That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of the...

April Dunford (00:23:00):
The old thing we were doing is better, that's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, "You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it," because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.

Lenny (00:23:23):
I think this is one of the most interesting insights that you share in your book and you also share this in the newsletter post about how buying software you could argue is harder than selling it because people will have learned there's skills and training for selling, but buying is, as you described, extremely stressful. Basically your job's on the line if you make a mistake. Is there anything more you can share along those lines just to help reinforce that buying software is extremely hard and stressful and people don't understand that?

April Dunford (00:23:50):
Once you get into that mindset, I think then you look at the situation a lot different. I think we've seen the statistics on this that says the buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying, "Nope, I'm not buying nothing." And in fact that's true 60% of the time. And so how do we combat that? The way we combat that is not just talking about ourselves, it's actually about trying to be helpful to that person in this very stressful situation that is trying to figure out how do I make a really good decision.

(00:24:27):
So what we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, "Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us. And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets." And so you can just think of it that way. So you don't need to know every single feature, every single thing. I'm giving you a bigger picture of the whole market and helping you feel good. Well, if you choose this or you choose that, now you know why.

Lenny (00:24:57):
I think what's interesting about this is a lot of startups fail because they can't convince anyone to switch from the status quo. And I think people always think of that as the current product is good enough and that's why they're losing, but I think this adds an additional wrinkle of it's also the person buying it is just like, "I don't want to add the stress to even decide and make the choice and put my butt on the line to switch." And I never thought of it that way.

April Dunford (00:25:22):
I think that hurdle is a lot more than you think. So we obviously have to compete with status quo, we can't ignore status quo, because sometimes status quo just is good enough and so we can't ignore that. We still lose deals to status quo, but we lose an awful lot of deals to just plain customer indecision, customers being more afraid of screwing up than missing out.

Lenny (00:25:46):
So to try to overcome that, to drill into the things you find most powerful, one is help the customer understand the bigger picture and why essentially they're falling behind, why maybe competition is going to have an advantage because they're thinking in a different way.

April Dunford (00:26:04):
Well, I'll throw something out about that.

Lenny (00:26:06):
Please.

April Dunford (00:26:10):
And I've heard people talk about this a lot that one of the things we could do in this situation when a customer is feeling this indecision is to lean into this FOMO and say, "Look, you're missing out. The competitors are all doing it and you're not doing it." And so this is an interesting question. And so I was super excited, Matt Dixon wrote this book called The JOLT Effect, and in that they studied two and a half million sales calls, they recorded on Gong and they studied it with AI, and then they looked at what happened after the sales call, so were these successful or not successful, did a deal happen or whatever. It's pretty rare that we get a chance to dig into some data like this.

(00:26:49):
And so what his data showed is if a customer is indecisive, throwing FOMO into the mix makes it worse. So they're less likely to close the deal if you throw that in. And the idea is that they're already stressed out and you're just putting more stress on them by pressuring them, by saying, "Oh, this is happening, bad things are going to..." You're like, "Bad things will happen if I do something, bad things happen if I don't do something, what do I do?"

Lenny (00:27:22):
They just put their head in the sand, right? They're just like, "Ah, forget it."?

April Dunford (00:27:24):
So they're just like, "Forget it, I'm doing nothing. Now I'm totally paralyzed." And so there's an assumption that companies are very motivated by this FOMO thing, but I think that that is not always true, and if the customer is actually indecisive, throwing in this FOMO thing isn't going to do it. So what does work in that situation is, one, giving them the tools to make the decision. So that includes paint the picture of the market, teaching them how to buy essentially. So teaching them, look, for customers like you, you just have to worry about these three, four things, and all this other stuff, it doesn't apply to you. That applies to bigger companies, that applies to whatever, so this idea of teaching a customer how to buy is one way to take that stress down.

(00:28:08):
And then there's a whole bunch of other techniques you can use. So one is if it's a really big deal, we can split it into smaller pieces, we can do things like offer you a money back guarantee, we can do things like sometimes we have services and support that are going to help you if things go bad and this is how we're going to make sure. So this idea of being able to take risk off the table is a really serious one if we've got a customer that is actually paralyzed because of this indecision thing.

Lenny (00:28:36):
That makes a lot of sense, basically it's like how do we help the buyer cover their ass if they made a mistake, because what you're saying is that's the main reason they're not buying your product.

April Dunford (00:28:43):
And this FOMO thing is just not going to do it.

Lenny (00:28:43):
That's so interesting. So I really like this framework. I wrote this down, teaching them how to buy, that is a really simple way of just thinking about this whole process.

April Dunford (00:28:53):
Well, it's funny, I was having this conversation with Bob Moesta, he did Jobs To Be Done.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Yeah, I watched that episode.

April Dunford (00:29:00):
So he's just the best. And so one of the things I think of is normally when we come at this we're like, "Well, how can we convince the customer that we do the job that they need to have done?" And obviously we need to do that, but there is this secondary job that the champion of the deal is, and that's how do I make a decision without getting fired? And so we got to help them accomplish that job, otherwise we don't get what we want, which is the money.

Lenny (00:29:28):
It's so interesting. And it's not even necessarily get fired, it's even the performance sufferers or they don't get the promotion, it's did they do a good job. This makes me think of a process at Airbnb we went through to buy community forum software and I just remember these massive teams of salespeople come to the office and pitching everyone on the software and they just keep pushing you to make what's the next step here, who do we need to roll in, who needs to buy into it? And it's just like, "Oh my God, it's so stressful. I have to keep this thing moving." And then there's IT coming in like, "Oh, we got to make sure it integrates with Salesforce." And you start with I just wanted the best community forum software because we were trying to build something really different and unique and you end up with like, "Okay, it's fine, just go with the thing that works with Salesforce. It's all good. I'm just going to move on to another process."

April Dunford (00:30:15):
Well, this is the thing, it's so easy to default to the market leader in that situation. The market leader has this big advantage that you can say, "You know what? Who's going to get me in trouble for picking Salesforce? Nobody." It's so easy to just flip back on that. And so if you're the challenger in this situation, the brand that's number two or number three, you've got to get over all of this inertia and tilting towards the status quo, because it's just so easy, it's the lowest risk decision, besides do nothing is to just pick the leader in the market and we'll just run with that.

Lenny (00:30:49):
I think the classic phrase was no one gets fired for buying Microsoft. I wonder is it Salesforce now that's the default version of that now?

April Dunford (00:30:55):
Yeah, the original one was IBM. [inaudible 00:30:57]

Lenny (00:30:56):
I think you're right. Oh, man.

April Dunford (00:30:59):
Now you totally get fired for buying IBM. I don't know what happens. The other thing you bring up is I think an interesting thing to think about too that really messes people up in these situations is that in B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen and so there's this complexity we don't have a consumer, but a lot of people I think overcomplicate that. In a typical B2B purchase process, we've got someone in that buying team is what we would call the champion. So that person is the person who's been tasked with, hey, pick us the accounting software or pick us the CRM, you figure it out. And so that person is the person that does the initial research, makes the short list, probably sits on the first calls, and then there's all these other people.

(00:31:49):
Now, the other people can't make a deal happen, but they can kill it a thousand ways. So the way this works is your positioning and your pitch needs to really work for the champion, because if it doesn't, you don't even get to talk to anybody else, you don't even get to go near anybody else if you don't make it out of the shortlist and you don't get the deal cooking. But once the deal is cooking it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups. So if you're the line of business buyer, let's say you're in the sales department and you're buying a CRM, IT is going to have to get involved at some point, and IT doesn't really care about the value of your CRM, but they do care does it meet the security requirements and does it integrate with the stuff we already have and how much of a pain is this thing going to be to manage, and so we're not actually pitching value to those people, we're just handling objections.

(00:32:46):
And so once we realize that, then we can get really tight on our positioning in our sales pitch. What we're really trying to do is just cook the champion, get the champion, and then once the deal's going we got to arm the champion for how to handle all these objections of all these other groups so that you can get a consensus to get a deal moving forward.

Lenny (00:33:05):
How do you actually do that? Is it ask them what are all the concerns you're hearing? Is it ask the individual stakeholders what your biggest concern is?

April Dunford (00:33:11):
Well, if we're really smart, we already know because we've done lots of deals. So if we're being a good partner in this, sometimes even in the very first meeting in that spot where we're talking about objectives, we're going to say, "Hey, look, IT is going to come in and they're going to be worried about this, this, and this, and don't worry, we got you."

(00:33:32):
So we're SOC 2 compliant, we do this, we do that, we know because we've done 15 deals and we know what these deals are like and we know what the stuff is going to be. You might have the champion come in and say, "Well, I don't know, end users might not like it." And it's like, "Okay, well, here's how we're going to get your end users on board, this is the training we have, this is the stuff we're going to do." The neat thing, if you have a product like [inaudible 00:33:54] on the front end of that, it takes that objection off the table. And you might have other things like you're going to take this to your boss and they're going to want to know ROI numbers, blah, blah, blah, and we've already done that, look, here's our calculator, if you give us this information, we can put this in, here's how you sell your boss.

(00:34:12):
So that's what we're doing. We're trying to arm them because we've done a million deals, they've never bought software like this before. So half the time you'll be doing deals and they don't even know what the purchase process is. And so if we're being good partners, we're like, "Okay, does this need to go to purchasing?" And they'll say, "Yeah, it probably does." Oh, well, here's what typically happens at purchasing. They're going to do this, this, this, and we're going to give you this stuff and that's going to help you get it through purchasing.

Lenny (00:34:40):
The way you're describing it now makes it feel like you need to be a big company for this to be useful because smaller companies don't have all these reps and they may not have the resources to do all these things you're describing. Who is this framework useful for? Can you use this approach if you're just, say, an early stage B2B?

April Dunford (00:34:53):
Well, so it's B2B products. If you don't have a sales team, I still think you can use this structure to build a story that marketing can use and you can use in different ways, and we can talk about that. But in the companies that I work with, they're B2B, they've got a sales team, and so the immediate thing we're doing is we're making a shift in positioning, we're building a sales pitch that reflects that positioning, we can immediately implement that in sales even though it's going to take a while for us to forklift the messaging and do other stuff and change our campaigns and everything else to match this new positioning, but we can tighten up the sales pitch and have an immediate impact over in sales on that. Second thing is that I've worked with tons of companies where the founder is the only sales rep and this works pretty good for that.

(00:35:39):
I don't think we need a ton of resources to do it, but I do think we need to have enough traction in the market that we understand how a deal typically goes. So if we haven't sold anything yet then we don't know yet, it's hard for us to help you buy something if we don't even know how to sell it. But if I've done 10 deals, I know what happens, I got a pretty good guess of what IT is going to say when you try to implement this stuff, I have a good guess of what's going to happen when we go to roll it out, I have a pretty good guess of what your boss might object to or might get excited by. And so I don't necessarily need a research team to go figure this out. This is just me trying to be helpful and help the champion do their job of getting this deal to the finish line.

Lenny (00:36:23):
So maybe the MVP of this approach is a deck that you continue iterating and adjust and restructure, and also bullet points of things you want to bring up like, "Okay, cool, IT is going to ask for these things," a few bullet points that you keep track of.

April Dunford (00:36:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I'm also thinking from the perspective of a product team building a product, they don't really sell it themselves. They work with sales, they work with marketing. Is there anything that you would recommend or that you think product teams could learn from this approach of selling that would help them build products in a different way or work with sales in a different way?

April Dunford (00:36:59):
Yeah. So here's what I think, the core of a good sales pitch is really deeply understanding your differentiated value, which is what is the value I can deliver that no other solution can. Often what I see at companies is you got a smart product team and they know a lot about the stuff they're building and why it's important and what the value is to the customer, and they did all this work on that when they were building it, but that information never made the jump to sales, because sales isn't even trying to pitch value. They're just pitching features like here's the dropdown menus, here's what they do. And so the first step in fixing this I think is to have a cross-functional team work on positioning.

(00:37:43):
So if I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product, deeply understand what's differentiated about it, deeply understands value, and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are, what the champion really wants to get done and doesn't want to get done, what the situation is in a typical account, and then all of this cool information sharing happens, which actually you end up with way better definition of your differentiated value in the first place.

(00:38:22):
And so once we've done that work, it is very natural then for us to work together on the sales pitch that reflects that. What typically happens is not that at all. What typically happens is product's working on some stuff, sales is working on some stuff, marketing's working on some stuff. Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, "I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see," and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.

Lenny (00:38:57):
That's a long time. So first podcast episode was all around positioning, and so folks want to get deep into that, they should listen to that, so we're not going to spend tons of time there, but differentiated value is a big part of this process also so I think it's worth spending a bit of time here. Could you maybe share a couple examples of what this is to give people a sense of what does it mean to share differentiated value?

April Dunford (00:39:20):
Yeah. So differentiated value is the answer to the question why pick us over the other alternatives? And so the way we get at that in positioning is we start with putting a stake in the ground of who do we actually compete with? And so if we didn't exist in the market, what would a customer do? And so typically there's some status quo thing, it might not even look like you, it might just be a spreadsheet, or do it with the intern or manual labor, and then there's whatever else ends up on a short list against us. And it's basically the definition of I got to beat all this plus indecision in order to win a deal, so I can stick my stake in the ground. Sales knows the answer to this question. If you have a sales team, they know the answer to this question, what would a customer do if we didn't exist, they know.

(00:40:06):
And then we get to the next step is, well, so what do we have that's different? And that's capability wise, feature function of the product or capability of the company, so it could be features, it could be your pricing model, it could be we have support in a way that the other folks don't. So there's all kinds of things it could be. It could be be the breadth of the portfolio that you have beyond that one product, we can fill whiteboards with this stuff. And then what we do is we go down that list of features and we say, "So what? You got advanced AI, whatever the heck the thing is, so what? Why does anybody care?" And the answer to that so what is your value. And because it came from this differentiated feature, it's generally value that the other guys can't deliver because they don't have the capabilities that underpin it.

(00:40:53):
So if I give you an example, a company I worked with a few years back, they've recently been acquired by Salesforce called LevelJump, and so they're in the sales enablement space, which is terrible. There's a million companies in the sales enablement space and they all look the same. And so LevelJump, so if you look at, well, what's the competitive alternatives, if I look at all the companies in the sales enablement space, you can put them into two buckets in terms of approaches, they're either a CMS like a jazzy content repository where you could make sure that people are using the right content and whatever, or they're an LMS, a learning management system, which I can build the course and certify you on the course, and that's how we're going to train the sales reps.

(00:41:39):
If you look at LevelJump, they're differentiated capability is they're the only one that's built on top of Salesforce. That's the feature, we're built on Salesforce, the other folks aren't. And then who cares? So what? And so when we first had a conversation about it, there was five or six different answers to that so what question, but the big answer was, well, because we're built on top of Salesforce, my sales enablement data is integrated with my sales data. And then you say, "Well, so what about that?" Well, because then that means I can actually tell did the sales enablement improve time to first deal or improve time to make quota? Well, so what about that? Well, if I improve that ramp time, then we get way more revenue faster. So that's the differentiated value.

(00:42:29):
When I go to do that in a sales pitch, I can translate that into my insight. My insight is every day your rep's not making [inaudible 00:42:36] it costs you money. So if we really want to solve sales enablement, don't we really want to have something where we can measure whether or not the sales enablement is working with sales metrics? Yeah, we do.

Lenny (00:42:47):
Interesting. So the differentiated value often informs the insight that you start with?

April Dunford (00:42:52):
It does. It absolutely is. The insight is basically the context that makes your differentiated value important, what is the thing you need to know to understand the importance of my differentiated value? In the case of Help Scout, the insight is, look, digital businesses like customer service is a growth driver, where does that come from? If you look at their differentiated value, it's there. And so we can just reverse it, flip it around. Even if the product wasn't necessarily constructed with that insight, maybe we got there sideways or the roundabout way or whatever, we iterated our way into that. We can look at the differentiated value and then basically reverse it out to the insight.

Lenny (00:43:33):
What's a sign that the differentiated value or insight that you've come up with just isn't clicking?

April Dunford (00:43:37):
If the differentiated value doesn't work in a sales pitch, what you'll get is the company going, "Why would I pay for that? This is not value for me, buddy." The companies I work with, the way I look at it is if you're in market and you're selling and you have happy, engaged customers, there's differentiated value there. That's why they picked you. That's why they love you. That's why they don't turn out on you. It's there. You might not know what it is, we might have to do a little process to get at it, but it's there and it exists.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Awesome. Another question that's been in the back of my mind since we started talking about differentiated values is just how honest should you be about the competition? Obviously there's a spectrum of extremely honest to super biased, what's your guidance on just how honest to be there?

April Dunford (00:44:34):
The posture I think you should assume in a sales situation, I had an old boss used to talk about this, is the posture we should have is calm confidence. So where that calm confidence comes from is we really understand why people should pick us. So this is differentiated value, we really understand it and we really understand who that's a really good fit for, and we don't even bother trying to chase anybody else.

(00:45:03):
So we should be able to come in and say, "Look, we're sales enablement that delivers results. If you don't care about those results, you shouldn't pick us. You should pick someone else." And so generally what we're trying to be is extremely honest. We're trying to come in and actually give credit where credit is due with the other approaches, because typically the other approaches work just fine for other kinds of companies. If you're really small and you're not growing e-commerce business, use a shared inbox. It's free, it's easy to use, there's no problems there, just use it. If you're really worried about bringing the cost down in a customer service center, maybe you should use Zendesk. And so I think the more we can act as a guide in this situation and come in and say, "Look, these guys are good for this, these folks are good for this, and we're good for this. And you might not care about that, and if you don't care about that, we're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us." But I think that...

April Dunford (00:46:00):
We're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us. But I think that this calm confidence idea is that where we know the client should pick us, we should be unafraid to fight for that business. But we should totally walk away from business where we're not the best fit. We shouldn't be chasing that business at all.

Lenny (00:46:20):
And this comes back to teaching them how to buy again and again. For these cases where you're like, "This is not a fit." Ideally you know that before you fly to their office and pitch them.

April Dunford (00:46:29):
Yeah, generally you've had some kind of qualification happen upstream, and so that qualification could be done in lots of different ways. If you've got some kind of product like growth motion in the beginning, you're looking for signals in that. And if the signals aren't there, then you're not talking to them. And so if you've designed your signals right, then you already know there's intent there. You already know you're a fit. You already know stuff. The way a lot of companies do this is they'll have inside sales do a qualification call before they set up a first call with a sales rep. In that qualification call, you're trying to make sure is this the right person? Do they have a need that we can actually meet? Is this actually a good fit for what we do? And if they're not, they don't even make it to the call.

Lenny (00:47:10):
Mm-hmm. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B1B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q3, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.

(00:48:09):
Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(00:48:32):
Another question around this idea of differentiated value and just alternative approaches is there's a certain previous guest who was very big on creating a category being extremely important, and that potentially being the only way to build a legendary business. I know you have a different perspective on that because in theory if you go that direction, there's no alternative. It's like "We're the one." What's your take on that?

April Dunford (00:48:55):
Well, so here's a few things. So one, obviously creating a category is not the only way to create a legendary business because the vast majority of legendary businesses did not create the categories that they're in. So Google did not create search, Facebook did not create social network. There's so many of them. It's actually more of an exception to the rule that the company is creating a category than the other way around. So I think it's a bit disingenuous to say the only way. It is a way to build a big business, no question about that. But it's absolutely not the only way. In fact, it is not the most common way, but it is a way and it does work. So that's one thing. The second thing is that category creation is interesting. Like most companies, if you look at their arc, even the category creators that are successful, they did not start out as category creators.

(00:49:53):
So they started out as a niche play in an existing category, and that's because that's generally the easiest way to get traction for a company early because what is the job of the market category? The job of a market category is to help answer the question, what is this thing all about? If I'm positioning an existing category, I can say, "Well, I'm CRM for very small businesses." That was Salesforce's initial positioning. I didn't have to explain to you what a CRM was, that already existed. There was already billion dollar company in that space. We know what a CRM is, and I could say "We're CRM for very small businesses. The reason you can use in this very small businesses is we don't have any software. So you don't have to have an IT department to babysit it. It's fantastic."

(00:50:34):
So most companies start there. Now what happens is that if you become the dominant player in that space, which again, category creation folks talk about this like no category creator has ever lost the market. In fact, most category creators wins their market. Like what happened to MySpace? What happened to Ask Jeeves? It didn't work out so good for them. Most category creators actually get overtaken by fast followers. So if we look at the CRM market, Siebel was the big dominant player there and now they're not. So now we've got Salesforce. Once you're the dominant player in that market, a cool move to do is to actually extend the boundaries of the category so that you can continue to grow. And most of the category creation examples we see are companies that when they were 200, 300, 400 million revenue dominating their space, then decided to move the goalposts and say, "Well actually now we're expanding into all these other areas and we're going to call this category something. And that's what it is."

(00:51:38):
And there's loads of examples of that. Like Qualtrics for example, is a company that a lot of people talk about very successful category creation. Well, they were survey software up until there were 300 million revenue just like everybody else in an existing category. So that got them there and that worked just fine. Oh, well, once we're dominating it, now we can say it's whatever, it is, customer experience software, whatever it is. Snowflake. Another good example like data warehousing in the cloud, they were that data warehousing, an existing market, were data warehousing for the cloud. That is not category creation. And that took them all the way up to the point where they were about to go public and now they're cloud data, which is their attempt to expand and say, "Well, it's not just data warehousing, it's actually data lakes and all other data stuff."

(00:52:22):
And so that's a smart move for them because they're now very well known in that space. I'm not saying category creation is a bad thing. There are examples of company that came right out of the gate and successfully created a category and then survived to own the category longer term. But a more common thing that happens is that the company does the hard work of creating the category and in exactly the moment where the category starts to take hold, fast follower can come in with fresh funding and a lot of it and learn from all your mistakes and come in and knock you off the peak right when you think you've made it.

(00:53:01):
So I think category creation is, again, it's good, it works, but I think we have to be very careful when we're thinking about doing that at an early stage business or a business that isn't already dominating the category that they're in. It's much more common to see companies come in, shave off a piece of the market, dominate that, and then successfully branch out. It's what Jeffrey Moore called bowling pin strategy. Almost all successful companies follow bowling pin strategy.

Lenny (00:53:29):
Wait, what is that? Let's touch on that real quick.

April Dunford (00:53:31):
Oh yeah, you remember that thing. It's funny how many times I've talked about bowling pin strategy in the last two months. So this comes from a bunch of work that was done around the way innovation gets adopted, blah, blah. So there's a bunch of research done on this stuff, and I'm going to misquote it because Jeffrey Moore stuff, I've been reading it for decades. But bowling pin strategy goes like this. The easiest way to take over a great big market is to define a segment of the market that is underserved by the market leader.

(00:53:59):
And so if you think about a bunch of bowling pins, we're going to circle around the lead pin, which is this little piece of the market that's easy for us to go get, and the market leader probably doesn't care about it. And so we knock over that pin and knocking over that pin enables us to get to the three pins right beside it. And so now I'm established here as a beachhead and I can go get the next three pins, I'm going to knock those over, and eventually I get big enough to challenge the market leader and then I overtake them.

(00:54:28):
So the example for my early career was I worked at this company, we thought we were enterprise software. We narrowed it down to CRM for investment banks, and so we literally drew bowling pins for our investors and said, "Lead pin is CRM for investment banks. Once we knock that over, then we're going to go to retail banking, then we're going to be CRM for banking. And then once we knock that over, we're going to go to insurance, then we're going to be CRM for financial services. Once we knock that over, then we're going to be a great big company and we're going to challenge Siebel to be CRM for enterprise software." Instead we got acquired by Siebel for like $1 billion, but whatever. So most companies, if you look at the history of them, they actually start that way. And so yeah, if we just fast forwarded to when they were 300 million, we can say "Category creation's the only thing to do," but it's like, well, what happened before then? That was something different.

Lenny (00:55:21):
Awesome. Let's come back to your framework. I'm looking at the list of bullet points. So we've covered a lot of this already actually. So there's the insight where you helped them understand what's happening in the world and what's changing and why this is important. Then you talk about what the alternative approaches might be, pros and cons. Then there's this third step, which we haven't talked about yet, which is sharing the perfect world characteristics of a perfect solution. Can you talk a bit about that and why that's important?

April Dunford (00:55:47):
So this is the conclusion of the setup phase. So if I'm Help Scout for example, the conclusion is we say, "Look, you really want customer success software that's as easy to use as an inbox. You're never going to outgrow it, but it was built from the ground up to be deliver an amazing service." And so it's this part of the pitch where we actually get agreement with the customer that we are aligned in terms of our point of view on the universe. So it's where I say, "Okay, we've had our little discussion about the pros and cons of the other alternatives," and we say, "So look, so are you with me, man? Can we all agree that a really good solution for you would have A, B and C?" And the customer is either like, "Yeah, right," or they're not. And so if they're right with you on this definition of the perfect world, then I've got you. I've already won the deal and I haven't even talked about us yet because the way I've set it up, I'm the only one that can deliver that.

(00:56:49):
So if you say, "Right," all I got to do is prove that I can do that and get you over the hurdle that it's possible for you to adopt it.

Lenny (00:56:59):
Sounds too easy.

April Dunford (00:57:01):
Yeah, I mean...

Lenny (00:57:02):
It's like you lure them in.

April Dunford (00:57:04):
If all of this was easy, Lenny we would be on a beach drinking out of a coconut.

Lenny (00:57:09):
Oh man, let's make it happen. Okay, so that's the setup. What do you call the second part again?

April Dunford (00:57:14):
It's the follow through-

Lenny (00:57:14):
The follow through.

April Dunford (00:57:15):
... which is really focused on differentiated value. So in the second part, the first step is usually we introduce our stuff, which is where the market category is important. So we come in and we say, "Okay, can we agree that a really good solution should tick these boxes? Yes. Okay, good. Now let's talk about us. Okay, so we believe that. That's why we build what we build."

(00:57:36):
So here I am, I'm Help Scout, we're customer service software for digital businesses or whatever our market category is. So we introduce it just to get people straight in their mind about what it is, and then we move to here's the value, here's how we do it. If we think about a typical sales call, like let's say a sales call is half an hour, 45 minutes, I would expect to spend more than half of the time in the sales call in this differentiated value phase. So if we're doing a demo, that's the demo, and we're saying, "Okay, step one, let me show you how we do this. So easy to use as an inbox. Here's the features. Never have to outgrow it, here's the features. Delivers amazing customer experience, here's the features." And so that's where we're getting to the meat of what you thought you were getting when you clicked on the button that said, "Give me a demo."

(00:58:25):
So that's what we're doing there. And then we end with these three little pieces. One is generally I got to show you some proof that I can do what I say I can do. So if I'm claiming this thing delivers an amazing customer experience, how do I prove that? Well, I can prove it by other customers saying it was amazing. That's one way to prove it. If I had some independent third party data that proved whatever I was claiming, I could show that there too. But a lot of times what we're doing is we're like, "Let me show you how this worked in a company that used our stuff. So this is what the before looked like. They did this thing, here's the after." And so customer case study is usually good way to do that, but there's usually a step called proof, which is, I showed you the value, now here's the proof that I can actually deliver on that value and it's not just me blowing smoke.

(00:59:16):
And then the step after that then is this optional objection step where they say, "Oh yeah, sounds good, but IT is never going to go for it," or "Sounds good, but maybe it's going to be too expensive," or something. And so you're going to handle that objection as best as you can. And then you finish with the ask, which is whatever the next step in your sales process is. So it's, "Hey, so what we have to do to get a deal cooking here, do we have to get IT involved? Does IT need to see it? Would you like us to come in and present with you with IT or do you want me to just help you work on some stuff for IT?" It's whatever your next step in the sales process is.

Lenny (00:59:56):
Awesome. So let me read through this just to have it also succinctly here in case people are taking notes or trying to remember the stuff. So there's the setup, there's the follow through. Within the setup, you have the insight, the alternative approaches, pros and cons, in the perfect world. And then you introduce your product, talk about the differentiated value, share the proof of why it works, potentially handle objections, silent objections, and then the ask of what comes next.

April Dunford (01:00:21):
That's right. That's it.

Lenny (01:00:22):
In terms of knowing if this is working and if your differentiated value works or if your insight works, do you have kind of a heuristic of a success rate that feels right? How often should this work for you to feel like "I think we have it?"

April Dunford (01:00:34):
Well, so generally if the sales pitch isn't working, it's because the positioning was weak.

(01:00:41):
And so companies that jumped straight to building the new sales pitch without going back and really making sure that they really nailed the differentiated value, who knows? Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. And a lot of times it doesn't, I think. And so in the work I do with my clients, we go all the way back to the beginning. So we go right back to let's work on the positioning first. Now, if I've got the smartest people from the company in the room and we've done enough deals that we are pretty knowledgeable about how customers buy and what they like and what they don't know. If I've got the senior executive team in the room and they've got a reasonable amount of customer experience, we can pretty much feel good that the positioning we come up with if we're following a process will be good.

(01:01:25):
Then it's just a matter of taking that positioning, mapping it to the sales pitch and then going to test it. So I think there's a bunch of things in testing that are really important. So one is we absolutely need sales involved in building the pitch. If we don't have sales involved in building the pitch, the pitch is never going to stick. The rule with sales reps is even if they don't like their current pitch, they're comfortable with the current pitch and they know it and they've memorized it and they have a little joke they tell on slide three. So they're not going to give up the current pitch without a fight. So you got to get sales management involved in building a new pitch, and then I would never just build the new pitch and then heave it over the wall and say, "Good luck, Chuck." Because what'll happen is they'll come up with all kinds of excuses why they can't use this pitch.

(01:02:07):
Instead, what you do is you take your best sales rep, your best one, and you bring your best sales rep over and you train them on the new pitch. They got to learn it, they got to pitch it to you, pitch it to the head of sales. We do a bunch of repetition on that, and then we have that rep test the pitch with qualified prospects. So we don't go to existing customers. They've already been polluted with the old positioning and the old pitch, and this needs to work with a qualified prospect, so let's do it in the way it was intended. We're going to take qualified prospects and work that new pitch with them. Usually what we'll do is a test period where after every pitch we'll huddle and say, "What worked? What didn't work? Maybe that word is tripping people up. Maybe we need to move this slide from here to here," and so we'll tune it.

(01:02:53):
And then after we've done a bunch of pitches, one of two things happens. And so in this test structure, I am very much relying on the expertise of my best rep to know what's good. So after the best rep is comfortable with the pitch, done a bunch of pitches, re-twizzled it, at some point the rep will say, "Okay, I think we're done optimizing this pitch, and I'm not going back to the old pitch. I'm sticking with this pitch because I think this one works better." An experienced sales rep will know that, whether the pitch is better than the old pitch, if you give them the opportunity to feel comfortable with it, work with it a bit and pitch a bunch of new prospects with it.

(01:03:38):
So if your best sales rep says, "Oh, this is way better than the old pitch. I can just feel it from the way people react to it and the number of times we've been able to convert people over into actual opportunities from a first call." Then what you do is at that point I call that pass. So then we take that rep, we can film them doing the pitch for training, and then we can take that rep, go back to the rest of the sales team and have that rep sell everybody else on it. So that rep goes back and says, "Listen up people, you're stupid if you're using that old pitch, which sucks. This new pitch is way better. Trust me, I'm the best rep on this whole team. By the way here's the list of deals I have cooking in the pipeline that I got using this deck. You should go do it and I'm going to teach you how to do it."

(01:04:24):
Now I got sales, teaching sales, teach and sales instead of marketing, sort of throwing something over the wall and crossing their fingers and saying, "Hey, I hope this works." What we should see is an immediate uplift in what happens after first call. So most of the time what that is we get a higher percentage of deals converting into opportunities after that first substantive calls. Sometimes depending on the quality of the pipeline we had coming in, we're actually disqualifying more. But sometimes that's a good thing.

(01:04:54):
But what we should see is an immediate uptick. It's stuff coming into the pipeline. It's a neat trick to pull, especially right now when everybody's budgets are really tight and you're just trying to squeeze more juice out of the lemon. It's a really easy way to get some more juice out of the pipeline. Just go in, tighten up your positioning, tighten up that sales pitch. And we can have instant impact with that because we can roll that out in a couple of weeks and start getting better deals flowing through the pipeline because these customers are understanding your value better, understanding why to pick you better. It's just easy, low hanging fruit to do when the economy's bad.

Lenny (01:05:32):
To give people a sense of maybe how easy that might be, how long would you suggest people spend on maybe tweaking their positioning and then also on this pilot, how much total time could it take to potentially significantly increase sales?

April Dunford (01:05:45):
So in the customers that I work with, when we do the positioning stuff, the positioning stuff takes a week. We're beginning and we're done in a week. We're all about speed on this thing. We're trying to get the thing happening fast. So we're in and out on the positioning in a week. It might take you, it depends on the company, the bigger the company, the slower this is, but some big companies are actually quite fast, and if you're motivated, it shouldn't take long for us to take that pitch and make it real.

(01:06:11):
Then we got to find a rep, train the rep, and then how long it takes us to test it really depends on how much deal flow you've got. So if you're working on monster deals and you don't actually get that many qualified prospects to pitch, that might take a few weeks. But if you've got a lot of prospects coming through the door, and you can get through this fairly quickly. So I've had companies do it start to finish. We got new pitch out the door and people using it in two weeks. That's about as fast as you can get it done. Most folks, I would say take about a month.

Lenny (01:06:39):
Cool. That is a very short-

April Dunford (01:06:40):
Sometimes you're like IBM and who knows when you get to it, right? But most folks could get through it if everybody's motivated, we can get it out and have it running a month.

Lenny (01:06:50):
You mentioned marketing and earlier you said that marketing is involved in this process in some way. What's your advice to just how to involve marketing, where they fit in?

April Dunford (01:06:58):
Yeah, so usually marketing is going to end up being the stewards of the positioning once the positioning is done. So they're going to end up being positioning police after this because a lot of the positioning stuff is going to take the form of marketing things. So they're invested in this. So when I was the VP marketing, I was the person that would instigate the positioning thing, let's get everybody together and work on the positioning. And then I would usually be the person that is driving, getting the sales pitch figured out, but it's me and sales and product working together. And then once the sales pitch is done, depending on the size of the organization and whether or not you have sales enablement or somebody inside sales that can babysit the pitch. Usually me and the head of sales would work on, "Okay, this is the pitch and this is locked down and we're not actually going to change this pitch until something happens that requires us to change the positioning. And then that's when we'll re-look at the pitch."

(01:07:55):
So we would look at recertifying the reps every quarter on the pitch and all that kind of stuff. And that would be generally, me in partnership with the head of sales. But it depends on how you do it. I don't think it really matters who owns it. If you have a good product marketing organization, good product marketing organization generally is very concerned with the positioning and the pitch, and those two things sit in their purview, but depends on how you define it. I can't wait till you get Airbnb. Tell us how this stuff works. They're different because they're a consumer, but companies are arranged in all different ways. So if you have product marketing, it looks one way. If you don't, it looks another way. Somebody's got to kind of be the owner of this thing though. And so we have to decide who that's going to be.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Just a couple more questions. One is to motivate people to do this. What kind of impact have you seen at companies that invest this time and rethink the way they pitch?

April Dunford (01:08:49):
Well, so people don't like me to talk about revenue stuff. Hugely what we've seen though is again, the immediate impact is felted sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that.

April Dunford (01:09:00):
Impact is felt in sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that. Because sometimes what the worry is, is we've got this old positioning and they came in through the pipeline that way. So they were exposed to our marketing somewhere with this old positioning, and then we hit them with the new positioning with this sales pitch. And aren't they going to be all like, "Oh, you moved my cheese." And usually it ends up not being a problem at all. So usually what we see immediately is an uptick in what's happening in sales. And so I've had a couple of companies tell me they've doubled the number of deals that they're bringing from first sales call to opportunity just by tightening up the pitch and getting that going. I think that's not unusual. I worked at a company where we did it in-house where I was the VP marketing, and we, within two quarters, had doubled the revenue just by tightening up the pitch. Just tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:53):
Holy shit. All right.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Tighten it up.

Lenny (01:09:54):
No big deal.

April Dunford (01:09:54):
Yep.

Lenny (01:09:54):
Okay. So-

April Dunford (01:09:56):
It was a big shift in positioning, I'll tell you that. Not small. Most of the time, we're not doing that. Most of the time, it's a tightening. We're not saying, "Oh, we used to be this and now we're this." Most of the time, it's a tightening, but usually the pitches are so bad. I'm telling you they're so bad that there's this low hanging fruit there that if we could improve it even a little bit, it actually has this big impact on how much stuff survives down the pipe.

Lenny (01:10:25):
And again, if folks want to go deep into the positioning step, your first book Obviously Awesome, is a great guide, and our first podcast episode goes through this. Plus you have a guest post in my newsletter where you give them a quick start guide. So there's so many tools to help you through this process.

April Dunford (01:10:38):
So many tools.

Lenny (01:10:39):
The other thought I've had in the back of my mind as we've been chatting is a previous guest, Andy Raskin, has a different framework, feels similar, but I know they're different. His framework starts with a shift that's happened in the world, and then here's who's going to win in the shift, here's who's going to lose. And then he goes into why this product is the best. What's your perspective on that approach versus this approach and the big differences?

April Dunford (01:11:01):
So the thing with that framework is I do think it works in certain conditions, but again, I think the conditions might be kind of edgy. So there's a couple of things that I think are lacking in that structure for a sales pitch. So the first one is there's actually no concept of differentiated value in that pitch, which for me is a giant miss. So in that pitch, it assumes that new is inherently valuable and old is inherently bad, and sometimes that's true. So sometimes there's just you versus the status quo and the status quo is some terrible old thing, some legacy thing or it's manual processes or something, and you're the only thing out there, then you can get away with that. But most of the time, we don't have that. Most of the time, there's multiple new ways of doing something and you just can't say, "Well, I'm the only new and the rest of you are old and bad."

(01:11:55):
So usually I've got to thread the needle. And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that for most companies, if we really understood customer and decision, old is good, it's safe, it's not risky. And does anybody ever say, "No, I'm not going to buy Salesforce. That's the old stuff,"? I just don't think that happens. So in a lot of cases, I don't think you can rely, it's lazy to say, "Buy this because it's new and new is better." Most of the time, the customers are going to want to know, well, what's better about it? Tell me what the value is that I can't get anywhere else. And you're going to have to get more specific than just saying, "Trust me, it's new and new is good." So that's the first thing. The second thing is this idea of starting with a trend. On the surface it looks kind of good, but the problem is often the trend is not unique to you. So everybody else sees the trend too. And so you are starting in a way that any of your competitors could start the same way.

(01:12:59):
I did this for years where I was taught to do problem solution. We would define the problem like a trend. We'd say, "Well, the change in the world." I was selling databases and I'd say, "Change in the world, data is exponentially growing." It's like, no shit. We all know that. All of my competitors could say that, and all of my competitors deal with the trend in the same way. So unless you have a particularly unique take on the trend, well, then it's not the trend at all really, is it? It's your insight into the trend. So I don't think trend is that great because it's not always unique to you. And ideally what we want is something that we can say that none of our competitors can. And typically a trend is something outside of our control. It's out in the world and everybody else can see it too.

(01:13:47):
So I don't think it's great. I think that structure looks a lot like the structure we use in a VC pitch or an investor pitch because we're talking about much longer timelines and we can say, "Look, the world is really changing and 10 years from now there's going to be chaos and destruction and the only one standing is us and therefore there is no competition." And because the timeframes are longer and we're talking about disruption of an entire market, which is pretty theoretical, we can get away with a lot of that stuff in investor pitch. In fact, we want to go there in investor pitch. Sales pitch is all about right now. Sales pitch is like, okay, I'm going to exchange my money for right now. You can't get too far into the future. Otherwise, all I'm doing is giving everybody a reason to delay, which they're likely to do anyway because they're indecisive about what they should do.

Lenny (01:14:39):
I feel like I need a debate version of this podcast where people come on and-

April Dunford (01:14:43):
I know, but here's the thing that I think people should think about when they're looking at all this stuff because it's terribly confusing if you're trying to figure this out. The one thing I really dislike about the category creation folks is they say that's the only way that you can be successful. And in general, that's just not true about anything. There's lots of ways to do everything. And so I think people should mess around with stuff. And for any of these frameworks, I think they should look at it and see if it works for them and their situation. And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

(01:15:16):
And I think they should steal things from wherever they can steal it and figure out what works in their own situation. My stuff, I like to think is a starting point, folks should use it as a starting point, but people shouldn't be slaves to it. There are lots of things that work at a market, and I think the only thing that we know for certain is that we can't say, "Well, this is the rule and it always works like this." If it was that easy, again, this wouldn't be so hard. We wouldn't have podcasts and newsletters and all kinds of things trying to figure this stuff out.

Lenny (01:15:49):
Extremely true. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

April Dunford (01:15:54):
Oh yeah. Lightning round. Oh gosh. It gives me stress. Okay.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Okay, question number one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

April Dunford (01:16:04):
Well, that's an easy question. So right now I'm really into Matt Dixon's work right now, which we've mentioned him a couple of times on the podcast, but Matt Dixon's new book called The JOLT Effect is really great just because there's all this data and the things that he discovered with that data, a lot of it go against what we would consider accepted sales wisdom. And so I think that book is full of juicy nuggets and everybody should look at it. His previous book, The Challenger Sale, and there was a companion book to that called The Challenger Customer. Those were also excellent and based on a deep set of research. And those books are older now, but what we see in The JOLT Effect is all the stuff holds true. All the stuff from The Challenger Sale has not changed in 10 years. So I think those books together are really cool.

(01:16:54):
The other one that I always recommend is the original book on positioning, which is the book by Ries and Trout Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. I have my copy of it, is dogeared. I probably read that book 100 times and I still see stuff in that book that I didn't see before. So I think if you really want to go deep on this positioning stuff, my book is the how to book. Their book is what is it in the first place book. And I think everybody that's interested in positioning should go read that.

Lenny (01:17:19):
Amazing. By the way, I have your first book somewhere behind me there. I don't know where it is, but it's there.

April Dunford (01:17:23):
I got mine right here so I can do this gag. There it is.

Lenny (01:17:23):
Nailed it.

April Dunford (01:17:27):
There's the new one, there's the old one.

Lenny (01:17:27):
The YouTube audience can see that trick that you've learned. Second question, what is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

April Dunford (01:17:36):
Oh man, I'm going to get in trouble for this. So you know Bong Joon-ho is the guy that did the movie Parasite?

Lenny (01:17:47):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:47):
So [inaudible 01:17:48] before Parasite, there was this book called, this movie called Snow Piercer. It's really old. I think it came out in-

Lenny (01:17:54):
I've seen that. Is that with the train?

April Dunford (01:17:54):
2013. Have you seen it?

Lenny (01:17:54):
Yeah.

April Dunford (01:17:57):
So I love this movie so much. So recently I went on a train trip with my dad and before I went to the train trip, we got talking about trains. And then we all had to go watch Snow Piercer again. Like me and my daughter watching Snow Piercer. We're really into this movie. And it's funny, when it came out, I was working at a startup and the CEO came and said, "Seen any good movies lately?" And I was like, "Oh man, you got to see this movie Snow Piercer." And he went on a first date with a woman and he came back the next day and he was so mad. He was not just kind of mad. He was really mad at me. He was like, "That was the worst movie I've ever seen." I was like, "Dude, you should have told me you were going on a date. I didn't know."

Lenny (01:18:40):
Yeah, that is my experience with that movie. I did not enjoy it, but I think you have to go into it [inaudible 01:18:46]

April Dunford (01:18:46):
It's polarizing. You either think it's amazing or you're like, that was terrible. What did I just watch?

Lenny (01:18:52):
This explains your taste in movies. We learned a lot about you, April. That movie is something else.

April Dunford (01:19:00):
Did you see Parasite? That was amazing.

Lenny (01:19:02):
That was amazing. Very different. Not what I imagined. I didn't realize it was the same person.

April Dunford (01:19:06):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (01:19:08):
All right. Okay, cool. That's two movies for people to watch. I'm curious how people think of Snow Piercer.

April Dunford (01:19:13):
Be warned don't go on a date with this.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Oh man, I still think about that movie sometimes. Next question, what is a favorite interview question you like to ask people that you're interviewing? Usually this is for when you're hiring, so whatever this comes up for you.

April Dunford (01:19:28):
So back when I was running teams internally back in my VP marketing days, I felt like a lot of marketing folks came with a certain amount of bad habits, particularly startup marketing folks. It's a bit of the wild west in marketing. And so sometimes they'd come in and you get into somebody new and they'd be really smart, but they learned something at the previous company that you're like, please never do that here. It's not going to work here. And so I developed a thing where I was just looking for attitude. Were you enthusiastic? Are you super into what we're doing here? And I can teach you pretty much anything. The only thing I can't teach you is persuasive writing. And I think that's a learnable skill. I think people can learn how to do persuasive writing.

(01:20:12):
I just don't have time to teach it to you myself. And so I used to give people a writing test, so I'd say, "Look, think of something you bought recently and write me two paragraphs and just sell me on it." And I used to love that test because people could either do it or they can't. And there's just so much stuff we end up doing in product marketing and marketing that involves a little bit of writing that it's kind of a foundational skill. And if you don't have that, that was the one thing I couldn't teach you.

Lenny (01:20:42):
Wow, that is fascinating. I've never heard of that as an interview question. And I love it. I feel like product managers-

April Dunford (01:20:47):
I stole it from a company that made me do it before I got hired, and I was like, this is a really smart thing. I'm [inaudible 01:20:53] stealing it. My thing was I got anxiety and I couldn't decide what product to write about, and I had literally just bought a new pair of running shoes. So I wrote two paragraphs about my new Brooks distance running shoes. But it was good. I got the job.

Lenny (01:21:09):
It is an excellent segue to our next question, which is, is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

April Dunford (01:21:15):
Right now I'm kind of into, I don't even know how to describe this category of things, but things that are kind of low tech but are awesome. And so one of the category of things that I really love right now is I'm really into fountain pens. I don't know if you've ever written with a fountain pen. [inaudible 01:21:35]

Lenny (01:21:35):
I haven't, but I know what they are.

April Dunford (01:21:36):
And so there's this company, Lamy, they're based in Germany, and they make the world's greatest fountain pens. They're beautiful, they're amazing. Some of them are really expensive. If you want to spend a lot of money on a pen, you can. But they have this one called the AL-Star, which is not an expensive pen. It's 20, $30. It may be expensive for a pen, but it's not so much money that you wouldn't feel bad if you lost it. So Lamy AL-Star. That's my great product lately. I don't have one right here. I should, it'd be a great prop to pick it up, but I actually don't have my bag here and it's in my bag. But Lamy AL-Star. You Google it. These are beautiful pens. And then if you haven't written with a fountain pen, it takes a minute to get used to it, but then it's like, gosh, it just feels great. You'll never write with a ballpoint pen again.

Lenny (01:22:22):
I was going to ask, is it the feel of the writing that you really enjoy about it?

April Dunford (01:22:25):
Feel. Totally different. Yeah. Amazing.

Lenny (01:22:29):
I use Muji pens. I don't know if you know these pens.

April Dunford (01:22:31):
Oh yeah, these are actually really good. They're like roller ball pens, roller ball pen, very good, but not as good as the fountain pen.

Lenny (01:22:31):
It's no fountain pen.

April Dunford (01:22:38):
The Muji pen is pretty good.

Lenny (01:22:39):
Then do you have to dip it in ink and stuff? How does that work?

April Dunford (01:22:41):
No. You actually, they either come with a little cartridge that you stick in or if you feel bad about the environment, you don't want to be throwing out cartridges all the time, there's a refillable cartridge, so you basically just stick another thing and it sucks it up and yeah, you don't dip it in ink. That would be crazy. I can't take that on the airplane, man.

Lenny (01:22:58):
Confiscate your ink. All right, questions get a little more challenging potentially or really easy. Do you have a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, you like to share with people, that you find useful to come back to?

April Dunford (01:23:11):
My thing lately is, and maybe this is just an old person thing, but my thing lately is nothing's a big deal. Nothing's a big deal, nothing's a big deal. And so you'll have stuff that you think is a really big deal, positive or negative, and you'll be like, wow, if this thing happened, it'd be so great, and then it happens and you're like, yeah, it's pretty great, but things are good otherwise, or it'll be the opposite. Like, oh, if this thing happened, it'd be so bad. Then it happens and you're like, that wasn't that bad. And so I don't know if this is good or bad, but lately I'm in this zone of I'm in this kind of chill zone where I'm like, nothing's a big deal, man. Everything's cool.

Lenny (01:23:56):
That super resonates. And as much as you say that to yourself, it's still hard to convince yourself of that sometimes. But that is a really good motto. I'm going to steal that myself. I kind of say that to myself often in different way.

April Dunford (01:24:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:24:10):
What is the most valuable lesson your mom or your dad taught you?

April Dunford (01:24:15):
Yeah, it is funny because it's a little bit related to that. So my dad ran a business, so I grew up in a really small town and my dad and it's cottage country in Canada. And so my dad ran the local toys for tourists, like boats and motorcycles and ATVs and that sort of thing. And he ran that business for years and years and he sold it a few years back when he retired. But it's a neat thing to grow up in entrepreneurial family because you kind of see this highs and lows. The business is really good. Then the business was really bad and then we were all broke and then the business was good and we were not broke. So there was this thing, and my dad used to always kind of have this attitude of you just got to grind it out.

(01:25:01):
You're just going to grind it out. There's going to be good stuff, there's going to be bad stuff, but the key is to just keep going, just keep going. And so he ran that business for whatever, 30, 40 years. I don't know. His motto is the home of fun since '71. So he started it in '71. I think he sold it three, four years ago. So a long time.

Lenny (01:25:21):
Wow.

April Dunford (01:25:22):
It all worked out good in the end. And so I don't know, I think there's something cool about growing up in a family where you can see the highs and lows and then again be like everything's we're just grinding it out over here. Nothing's a big deal.

Lenny (01:25:34):
It's clear where all that comes from now.

April Dunford (01:25:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:25:37):
Final question. You do a lot of traveling, you do a lot of speaking, you go to a bunch of cities. I'm curious just what is your favorite either city that you go to that maybe people may not know about or venue that you speak at?

April Dunford (01:25:49):
It's such a cliche, but I love Paris. I just love it. But for me, Paris is like a particular vibe. So when I was in university, I did an exchange when I was in engineering and I did third year engineering at a school just outside of Paris. And so I spent the whole year there, learned a bit of French. My French was pretty good at the end. My French is really bad now. So I kind of get Paris. I like Paris. And so when I go to Paris, I just have the best time. I have my set of restaurants I want to go to. I have my handful of places I want to go shopping. I put my butt down in a cafe, look at the beautiful people, drink my nice coffee. I just really dig the whole vibe of Paris and people are starting to know that now. So French companies will call me and they'll say, "Do we get a Paris discount? We hear you like coming here." And I go, "Okay."

Lenny (01:26:50):
Now this is going to [inaudible 01:26:51]

April Dunford (01:26:51):
There's a great product management conference there called La Product Conference run by these folks at Tega, shout out to Tega. So I've been there a number of times for their conferences and they do an amazing job and the venue is really great. It changes around. But last year, the last time I went there, which was two years ago, it was at an old theater in [inaudible 01:27:13]. Absolutely beautiful. And that was a pretty great venue in a great city with a great conference. So yeah, shout out to French people.

Lenny (01:27:22):
Oh man. That sounds dreamy. Paris. I see how that could be a favorite. April, I think we accomplished everything we were hoping to accomplish. I think everyone that has listened to this podcast is going to be better at pitching and selling. It feels like even if they take one element of this framework, say starting with an insight or focusing on different value will make them better. And so I'm proud of us. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

April Dunford (01:27:50):
So where can people find me? I'm aprildunford.com. The only social media I'm doing these days is LinkedIn. I'm a bit social media-ed out. I'm experimenting a little on threads and Instagram, but LinkedIn is a good place to find me if you just want low lift way to follow my stuff. But I'm doing all the things now, Lenny, I got a podcast, it's called Positioning with April Dunford. I got a newsletter that's also called Positioning. You can find that if you go to, it's on Substacks, you can find it there, otherwise aprildunford.com/books and you can sign up there. But those are the big things. And then there's the books, obviously, if you want to learn more about this stuff. Everything I know is in the book. There isn't stuff that I know that isn't in the book to be honest.

Lenny (01:28:34):
Amazing. And then how can listeners be useful to you? Just check out those things.

April Dunford (01:28:37):
I guess so. You know what? I'm in this phase. I think, again, I think it's an old age thing. I am in this kind of philosophical phase where I'm not going to be doing this forever. And what I'm trying to do right now is get everything that's useful out of my head and out in the world before I'm done. And so right now I'm very focused on delivering useful things for other people. I didn't think I needed to write a book about sales pitches, but then I got the idea in my head, everybody's sales pitch is so bad and there isn't a book on how to build a sales pitch. And I'm not saying mine's the world's greatest thing, but it's better than nothing. So this is what I'm trying to do right now. I'm trying to be useful to other people because pretty soon I'm not going to be doing anything, I think is the idea.

Lenny (01:29:29):
Arnold Schwarzenegger's new book is called Be Useful. And I feel like that's the perfect description of how to be successful and especially in the work that we do, just helping people. But I keep coming back to that. It's just be useful.

April Dunford (01:29:41):
I think this is a really important thing. When I wrote the first book, people started writing back to me and saying, "Oh, your book was so great." And my reflex action was to say, "Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it." But then I stumped myself and I was like, you know what? I don't actually care if you enjoyed it. This isn't entertainment. I'm actually trying to create something that's useful. So what I really want is for people to read this stuff and come back and say, "That was useful. We were struggling with this thing, and that unlocked something for me and that was useful." And that's what I'm trying to do right now.

Lenny (01:30:11):
April, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing.

April Dunford (01:30:14):
Thanks so much. It's always good to be here.

Lenny (01:30:17):
Always good to have you here. And we might do a V3 when you do a third book if you ever-

April Dunford (01:30:21):
No, not happening.

Lenny (01:30:25):

## Transcript

Arielle Jackson (00:00:00):
So over time, a word can come to mean something that is beyond what that actual word means. Like Disney means magic today. Volvo means safety. Those names are not good. If I just put it in a spreadsheet or one of those lists, no one would pick it. So that's kind of what I mean, that the name is just part of the overall marketing or the overall brand and a bad name with a really great company with great company strategy, great marketing is going to be great over time. And a good name is just going to help you, but I don't think a bad name is going to kill a good company.

Lenny (00:00:42):
Arielle Jackson spent nine years at Google, where she helped grow Gmail in its early days, taking it from just a side project to a product that is now used by hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Then she went on to Square, where she was one of the first marketers and helped launch and scale the growth of Square reader. She's also worked with over 100 early stage companies, helping them nail their brand and marketing efforts, including Patreon, Loom, Front, Eero, Maven, Sprig, just to name a few.

Lenny (00:01:12):
These days, she teaches a super popular course on startup brand strategy and she's a marketer in residence at First Round capital. In our chat, we cover primarily three things, naming strategies for your startup or your product, a framework for developing your brand, that includes your purpose, your positioning, and your personality, and also getting PR for your startup. I can't wait for you to listen to this conversation with Arielle. And so with that, I bring you Arielle Jackson.

Lenny (00:01:41):
Hey, Ashley, head of marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:01:49):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:01:51):
And how many of them screw that up? And what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:01:54):
Well? Based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:02:13):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I'm consistently seeing that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:02:28):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because [inaudible 00:02:38] data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

This episode is brought to you by unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList head of product, banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack.

Lenny (00:03:15):
Embedding banking into your product, not only adds differentiation, but also helps you acquire, retain and monetize your customers. Unit is the market leader in banking as a service combining multiple bank partners with a developer friendly API to empower companies of all sizes to launch accounts, cards, payments, and lending in just a few weeks. Unit is trusted by leading brands, such as AngelList, [inaudible 00:03:39] Invoice2go And Roofstock.

Lenny (00:03:58):
Welcome to the podcast, Arielle.

Arielle Jackson (00:04:01):
Thanks so much for having me. It's great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:03):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've read so much of your writing online. You've done a lot of writing, which I found really helpful. And so I'm really jazzed to be digging into all kinds of really good stuff. Before we get into some of the meat, just a couple questions that I had in my mind. You've worked with so many amazing companies, Google, Square, Loom, Patreon, Front. So many others. I don't want to keep going. What's been either your favorite or most unusual project that you've worked on?

Arielle Jackson (00:04:35):
Gosh, it's like asking me to choose my favorite son. I'm like, gosh, I can't really like pick one.

Lenny (00:04:40):
That'll be the next question.

Arielle Jackson (00:04:41):
I would probably say that my favorite project, and this is because they get reminded of it on a daily basis was working at on the Square stand at Square. It was the first time I ever worked on hardware and our joint Square was 140 people. We had no marketing function. We had a couple marketing people. We had no product managers and the hardware team was running the show on launching this new product that was supposed to get us up market into brick and mortar.

Arielle Jackson (00:05:05):
And anyway, I was running event marketing at the time and giving away a bunch of those readers that you stick into a phone for free and having a lot of small merchants use. I volunteered to run the launch of this product as a product marketer for the first time. And it was just so fun, doing everything from positioning it, figuring out how we were going to talk about this beautiful new piece of hardware that would turn your iPad into a real point of sale.

Arielle Jackson (00:05:31):
We had people fly around the country and get cool coffee shops and brick and mortar businesses seeding it so that they would all use it. We had I think 15 Metro areas covered with the coolest coffee shops and donut shops and everything at launch. And you know, there was a lot of fake it till you make it. I was negotiating a deal with Best Buy in the Apple store. Never done anything like that before.

Arielle Jackson (00:05:53):
Designing packaging was really awesome. There was just so much to it launching a physical product. And at the time it was at a pretty high price point for a company that had always had one free product and helping that company go up market. And I remember I was 30 something weeks pregnant when we launched. We got all the blue bottle stores to use it. And we had this launch event where Jack, our head of hardware, Jesse unveiled this product at the blue bottle in Mint Plaza. And I was super pregnant and super proud. And I still get kind of excited every time I pay on one of those, which is all the time.

Lenny (00:06:30):
Super pregnant and super proud. I love it. And that product that was the POS stand, the iPad thing that you kind of swivel and sign.

Arielle Jackson (00:06:39):
Yeah. And there's been new versions of it since, there's a contactless version of it, and there's one with an integrated screen that I think is Android based, which you don't have to have an iPad, but that product's still around. I still pay on that original Square stand all the time. I drink a lot of coffee. Those independent coffee shops around LA. So they're all still using it.

Lenny (00:07:01):
We're going to talk about positioning a bunch, but while we're on the topic, what was the positioning of that product while we're talking about it?

Arielle Jackson (00:07:07):
Yeah, so at the time Square was mostly used by farmer's market vendors and event vendors. I made jewelry in a past life and that's how I got to Square was being one of those vendors. And the positioning was really that it was for brick and mortar businesses, particularly quick serve coffee, donuts, sandwich shops that kind of quick serve brick and mortars. And it was up against your ugly old point of sale. Your cash register effectively. That was our foil. And the benefit was turn your iPad into a point of sale. And the differentiator was about one unified experience that you can do everything you can on your cash register and more, and you'd be proud to have it out on your counter.

Lenny (00:08:01):
So you said that you were creating jewelry and that's how you got into Square to work on this product. I need to hear more about that.

Arielle Jackson (00:08:08):
Yeah, sure. So I was working at Google before Square and I'd always had this hobby of making jewelry and I used to sell my jewelry in a few different like boutiques around San Francisco and LA. It was a very small side hustle, but it was my creative outlet. And I sold at craft fairs around Hanukah/Christmas time. So I used to sell and just take cash. And then I got a Square reader and I sold at a craft fair that year. And it was awesome. That Square reader, it helped people buy more, it helped me sort of look cool. It was just really great to accept credit cards. I'd never done it before.

Arielle Jackson (00:08:49):
I used to take PayPal invoices and be on my computer and send someone an invoice and they'd get it. It was painful. All the reasons that people use Square, I experienced it. And two people I knew from Google, Megan Quinn and Kyle Dink had gone to Square from Google. And so after I had that experience, I think I sent them both an email just being like, this thing's fucking awesome. I make jewelry. It was great. I sold I think it was 50% more than I did last year because I accepted credit cards and I can't remember which of them wrote back first, but they were like, come interview. And so that was basically how I ended up at Square.

Lenny (00:09:27):
Wow. I bet that helped you a lot through the interview, actual have personal experience.

Arielle Jackson (00:09:32):
Having been a merchant, I think it helped me understand the small merchant that initially we were marketing to.

Lenny (00:09:38):
And so today you are marketing expert in residence at [inaudible 00:09:45] capital. I was going to ask what does that mean and what is it that you do day to day these days?

Arielle Jackson (00:09:51):
Sure. So after I left Square, I went to a tiny startup that was seven people. They were funded by First Round and I helped them with everything that a tiny startup that's trying to grow needs.

Lenny (00:10:06):
What startup was that?

Arielle Jackson (00:10:06):
It was called Cover. They were acquired by Twitter. It was an Android app that could get you the right apps at the right time based on where you were by changing the lock screen on your phone. And so that company and that experience of working at this tiny startup that was seven people, I really liked it. And then they got acquired by Twitter, but I had just left Square. So I decided not to join Twitter with the rest of the team. And instead I just decided I was going to help a bunch of other small startups. And I emailed a few friends from past lives who had small startups, which was like, Hey, I'm not going to Twitter with the rest of the team. You do need marketing help. And every single person wrote back and said, yes. And that's basically how I started consulting.

Arielle Jackson (00:10:49):
I guess it was about eight or nine years ago. At the same time, First Round had reached out and said, hey, who did you use for marketing comps for cover? And I got connected with Brett from First Round and he's like, would you help our companies? And we did a three month project for one day a week, nine years ago. And I'm still there. I work halftime at First Round. So I do everything I do for other companies, but for First Round companies on First Rounds time.

Arielle Jackson (00:11:17):
So the way it works is if you're funded by First Round and as part of your onboarding, we offer a lot of value add services and I'm one of them. And those services can be everything from, we have someone who's really good at compensation and HR stuff and we have someone who will help you with pricing and I'll help you with marketing. And what that means when you're a seed stage startup is everything from naming to positioning, to developing a brand identity, a website and your initial launch, and eventually hiring a marketer. So that's sort of the bread and butter. That's what I like working on anyway. So it's a good fit because we invest in a lot of seed stage companies at First Round, I get to help almost all of them.

Lenny (00:11:58):
That's an excellent segue to what I wanted to get to next. What I want to do in our chat is cover three broad topics. Things that I know are very near and dear to your heart, naming for products and startups, your brand development framework and how to hire marketers. Does that sound good?

Arielle Jackson (00:12:15):
Awesome. That's what I like to talk about. So yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (00:12:19):
Let's do it. Surprise, surprise. Okay. So with naming, I've actually heard from a few founders that you were really helpful to them in naming their startups. Folks that have maybe been on this podcast that will go unnamed. So for founders trying to come up with a name for their company or their product, two questions. What makes a good name for a product or a startup, and then just how do you come up with a great name?

Arielle Jackson (00:12:44):
I love naming. I think I've named just over 30 companies at this point. And actually when I mention how I got into consulting when I emailed some friends and asked them if they needed marketing help, I think I'm allowed to talk about this one. So one of those companies was some friends from Google, Adrian and Carl. They had left Google, gone to Facebook and then started a company it's now called Seesaw. It's an ed tech company. That was the first company I named post Google Square, all of that.

Lenny (00:13:09):
It's an awesome name.

Arielle Jackson (00:13:10):
It is an awesome name and I'll use it as an example. So seesaw is a ed tech company. They had a really bad name before that and we did this whole naming process and ended with that name and why I think that's a good name is when I say Seesaw, you don't really know what it is, but when I tell you, oh, it's this ed tech company and it's an iPad app and it helps the work that elementary school students do go between the teacher, the parents and the student. And you're like, oh, well, Seesaw makes sense for elementary school, it's something that goes back and forth. It has that sort of nostalgic feel. And it makes sense that it's an ed tech company.

Arielle Jackson (00:13:48):
And I personally tend to like those kinds of names that are suggestive or evocative, where when I tell you what the company does, you're like, oh, that makes sense. But it's not that what the name is tells you exactly what the company does. So that's an example, I think of a good name. I don't know, during COVID and when my older son's school was closed and they all used Seesaw and I got to tell my son, oh, that's my friend's company and we named it back in the day. And he was like, oh, that's cool. That name makes sense.

Arielle Jackson (00:14:21):
That's the reaction you want. It also has a little bit of emotion to it. It has some nostalgia. It's fun to say it's short, it's memorable. I think all of those things make a good name. Another company that has a good name that you and I have both worked with is Maven. So they're a First Round company. Gogan has talked about this publicly. We named that company together. Maven is a Yiddish word that means one who understands and it means specifically one who understands because they've done something, they've acquired the skills or knowledge over time.

Arielle Jackson (00:14:58):
And I just think that's such a cool name for a platform that allows X operators or current operators to teach their skills to other people through cohort based classes. You want to be a Maven, instructors are Maven's, it's short, it's easy to say, when I tell you what that company does, that name makes perfect sense. So I tend to like those [inaudible 00:15:17] of names myself, but I also, I don't know, I like other kinds of names for other kinds of products too. I think it really comes down to what is your product? What is your company? What is the name trying to achieve and really getting clearer with those criteria. So we can talk about the criteria that always apply, the criteria you might add and a process to get there.

Lenny (00:15:38):
That sounds great. Yeah. I'm really curious about a process. If one exists, that'd be really cool. So another question in my mind is just some names are just nonsense words like Yahoo and I don't know Google, I guess. What's your take on that as a name, that approach?

Arielle Jackson (00:15:51):
Yeah. So words like that are empty vessels, they really don't mean anything. If you think about the name Yahoo, it's actually like really silly. It's like Yahoo. I always hear it like that. Google has a meaning for people in the know with the one followed by as many zeros. It's like a big number and it's a misspelling of that. So that one's a little less silly to me than Yahoo. My take on empty vessel names is they can be really memorable and they can be evocative of the emotion, but you have to do a lot more marketing work over time to make it mean something.

Arielle Jackson (00:16:25):
So if I say Yahoo today, we know it's that search engine we use before we all switch to Google and we have the purple color in our head, and we think about what it meant at the time that we might have used it, but it took a lot of marketing dollars and a lot of time for that word to be in that. So they're doable. I worked on a company Eero. That has kind of what is almost an empty vessel name. Eero is for Eero Saarinen who was a designer. He did like these really beautiful buildings, architectural buildings. And then also some tables. You can get a Saarinen and table at Design Within Reach, but that name, nobody knows that unless you're in the design community. And so that name is effectively an empty vessel and they have to spend a lot and be consistent about making that [inaudible 00:17:16] mean a wifi system.

Lenny (00:17:17):
I want to get to the process, but another question is why is it important for the name to kind of connect to the company and what they do? Is that just it feels nice to people or is there some kind of a bigger reason?

Arielle Jackson (00:17:30):
Yeah. So it doesn't have to, and examples like Eero and Yahoo, it doesn't. Even if you think about Apple, it doesn't. Apple has nothing to do with Apple computers. It's a word we all know. There's a lot of words where there's no meaning behind it. If there is a meaning behind your name, your name is doing a little bit more of your marketing work for you. So if your name is Internet Explorer, RIP, I know exactly what you do.

Arielle Jackson (00:17:56):
If your name is Chrome and you're a designer on the web, you kind of might be like, oh, that makes sense. That's the area around the browsing window. If your name is Firefox, I have no idea what you did. You just took two words and put them together and made something up. And now you have to spend, and you have to be consistent over time in making that word mean something for people. But all three of those browsers were successful at a time. And I don't think the name had anything to do with Internet Explorer's demise.

Lenny (00:18:25):
Got it. So it's kind of ideally you can find an easy mode. If that doesn't work, then you go hard mode. You come up with your empty vessel name and then you just have to do a lot of work.

Arielle Jackson (00:18:33):
That's my personal preference.

Lenny (00:18:35):
Okay, cool. That makes sense.

Arielle Jackson (00:18:37):
My personal preference is if you think about there's descriptive names, the Internet Explorer, there's suggestive names like Chrome, then there's evocative names, which I would say Seesaw and Maven fit into there where they're like in between suggestive and evocative, and then there's empty vessel names or fanciful names. There's a spectrum. And when you do your brainstorm, we can talk about this in the process, you want to think across all of them, but you might have in your naming brief, we want a suggestive name, or we want a descriptive name. You might go into it with that. And so there's times and places for all of those names across the spectrum. My personal bias is I tend to like suggestive names.

Lenny (00:19:16):
Makes sense. Okay, let's get into it. What should teams do when they're trying to name something?

Arielle Jackson (00:19:22):
Yeah. So the first thing is to do your product positioning. I really believe that positioning dictates so much of your marketing and should always be the first thing you do. I had a student in my last class that I taught through Maven. I teach a class on brand strategy and he was I think a second or third time founder, who had never taken a class on brand strategy. He worked really hard. He was awesome. Anyway, at the end of the class and you kind of do this closing thing. And he goes, I'll never write a line of code without doing positioning first. And that was music to my ears. I think positioning comes first, but in any case, you do that first, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. And then you write a naming brief and it's really simple.

Arielle Jackson (00:20:07):
What are you naming? Are you naming a company? Are you naming the product? Are you naming both? Usually if you're early stage company, you're naming both and they're going to have one name because you don't want people to have to remember two things. What do you want the name to communicate? So in that example of Seesaw, we wanted it to communicate young childhood. In the example of Eero, we wanted it to communicate design, being designed forward. It can be whatever you want it to communicate. What do you want to avoid? We don't want it to sound like this competitor, or we hate this word or whatever you want to avoid. What are the names of competitive and related products? And then are there other considerations? I worked with another First Round company that was operating in China.

Arielle Jackson (00:20:53):
And one of the considerations was this has to be pronounceable for a native Chinese speaker. That's a very valid, additional consideration. And then there are seven criteria for names that always apply in my opinion. And you could add additional ones, like that Chinese speaking one would be an additional one. The seven are trademark, which is kind of obvious, can you use this? Are you violating someone else's trademark? And the second step with trademark is, do you need to proactively protect the name? Domain availability, so everyone gets hung up on getting a.com like maven.com got maven.com. It was an arduous process that Gogan wrote about on Twitter. But these days, you don't necessarily need the.com. Square operated on SquareUp for very, very long time. Lots of companies are operating on variants of a .com. So domain availability, distinctiveness. Is it memorable?

Arielle Jackson (00:21:51):
Is it sound like someone else's name? That's I think one of the most important ones, just is it different and distinctive? Is it timeless? So there's a lot of naming trends. If you tell me Optimizely I could tell you what year was the company formed when it ends in LY. If you tell me a word like Flicker, I can tell you what year it was, because that was the naming trend to remove vowels. So I generally stay away from naming trends, because I want your company named not to sound dated in 10 or 20 years. The last one is it's kind of related to that. What we talked about in the brief, what do you want the name to communicate? Which is the name reflective of your key messaging or does it somehow suggest an emotion or feeling that you're trying to convey, and then sound and ease of pronunciation.

Arielle Jackson (00:22:44):
Is it fun to say, is it easy to say, how is it to spell? We almost named a First Round company a while ago Lattice which is now a different company that's doing quite well, but we didn't name it that because this was a company that was B2B sales was going to be their main channel. So they're going to be people on the phone being like, hey, I'm calling from Lattice and we went through this exercise and we're like lettuce? It's not so easy to say and spell. So we actually didn't name the company that and went with something else. But there's a company now doing quite well.

Lenny (00:23:16):
You think that was the right move?

Arielle Jackson (00:23:18):
I don't know. I always say a good name is only going to help you, but a bad name won't hurt a good company. So I don't really feel-

Lenny (00:23:25):
Interesting. Good to know. Yeah. Keep going.

Arielle Jackson (00:23:27):
And then the last two are appearance. So there are some names that just lend themselves really nicely to visual design and they have to do with how tall the letters are and is their symmetry and if you give this to designer, making a logo just so awesome and cool and fun and then length. So a lot of people, they want to name like Square and Stripe and these one syllable names, but a two syllable or even a three syllable name can often be more memorable.

Lenny (00:23:57):
lennysnewsletter.com. Shoot.

Arielle Jackson (00:24:00):
Yeah. Well, so you got the Lenny part with the two syllables is generally a nice sweet spot.

Lenny (00:24:07):
Sweet. Have you put out a template or anything that folks can find to do this? Or should they kind of listen here and take notes?

Arielle Jackson (00:24:15):
Yeah, there's an article on the First Round review called Positioning Your Startup is Vital, Here's How to Nail It and all those criteria and how to do naming is actually in that article.

Lenny (00:24:27):
Awesome. We'll put that in our little show notes. And then as you go through this, is this a binary thing or you kind of rate each of these categories one to five?

Arielle Jackson (00:24:36):
Yeah. So the way I do it is I apply the criteria after we do the brainstorm. And then we do red, yellow, green on each of those criteria just to weed out ones that are not doing well on any of those. Got it. And then you add your own criteria. So the next steps the brainstorm. I'm going to go fast through this.

Lenny (00:24:55):
Yeah. I was going to ask you about the brainstorm. I'm excited to hear this.

Arielle Jackson (00:24:57):
Yeah. So the way that I run a naming process is I like to first do positioning and then I set up an hour with the founders and me and ideally a couple other people who are interested, but disinterested. So I'll bring a writer from the First Round team or the founder has a friend who's a linguist or the founder has a friend who speaks four languages. We like those kind of people to be in it if possible. And it's generally five to seven people in a brainstorm. And the idea is we spend one hour, I set it up beforehand and we try to come up with hundreds and hundreds of bad ideas and a couple decent ones that are worth exploring more. And the brainstorm is two parts. The first part is based on words in your positioning statement.

Arielle Jackson (00:25:40):
So we take all the meaningful words out of your positioning statement is the warmup and we run synonyms, antonyms, free associations, other languages, whatever we can do off of those words. And so if your words in your positioning statement are related to what that you do, which they very well should be, that's a great way to just come up with hundreds of words really quickly. And then the second step is a thematic brainstorm. So I pick between seven and 10 themes, you can think of them like Jeopardy themes. So it's like, I don't know, okay, so there was an-

Lenny (00:26:11):
Source.

Arielle Jackson (00:26:11):
... AI. Yeah. It was like an AI tool for strawberry picking and the themes would be the history of strawberry farming or botany 101, things that are related. You could do like last names of famous farmers, think about how did Tesla get their name? They probably did last names of people related to electricity, and that's such a great name, so thematic brainstorm. And then that's usually a little more fruitful. And we do the same thing, free association, all that.

Arielle Jackson (00:26:40):
I spend some time afterwards on Wikipedia and the internet and actually finding words words. Also love the library, check out books sometimes and just read books on the topic and just write down the interesting words that come up. And anyway, so then I give them back a short list. The short list is around 10 to 25 concepts that are ideas that are worth looking at further. And from there narrow it down based on the criteria and the red, yellow, green, we come up with three to five, don't come up with one because you might not get it for trademark, and it's really sad when you get really attached to one and then you can't use it. So yeah, three to five top contenders. And then you go through trademark process domain and kind of go from there.

Lenny (00:27:23):
That was amazing. If you're doing a startup name versus a product, is the process any different or is it basically the same?

Arielle Jackson (00:27:29):
No, same. The only difference is if you have a lot of equity in your company name... Square is a good example. Square had a lot of equity. Google is a perfect example. A lot of equity in the company name, you often don't want to name your products something really creative and different because you actually want the equity in the master brand to come through. So if you think about Square's names, they have other ones, when they diverge from the Square brand like cash or when they want something new or Google, when they came out with Android and they wanted to diverge from the master brand. But think about all the products. Square Register, Square Stand, Square App, Google Maps, they're really boring and it's because the equity is in the company name and the product name can actually be boring and descriptive.

Lenny (00:28:20):
That makes sense. I want to come back to a point you made that a great name will help a startup and a bad name is not going to hurt you or I forget the word to use. I'd love to hear that because that's that's really interesting.

Arielle Jackson (00:28:33):
Yeah. So if your company has a great name and the name is remarkable, people will be like, oh, that's a great name, or it just makes sense. In the case of Seesaw like, that's a good name for that company. That good name is just going to help people talk about it. It's going to spread word of mouth. People are going to like to talk about the company. If you think about there's a lot of companies with bad names that we use all the time or even quite boring names that we now love. So if you think about Disney, Walt Disney's last name, it didn't mean anything, but over time that's such a good company and it got imbued with all this meaning and now it stands for magic and stands for so much, but it was just the dude's last name. So over time a word can come to mean something that is beyond what that actual word means.

Arielle Jackson (00:29:21):
Disney means magic today. Volvo means safety. Those names are not good. If I just put it in a spreadsheet or one of those lists, no one would pick it. So that's kind of what I mean that the name is just part of the overall marketing or the overall brand and a bad name with a really great company with great company strategy, great marketing is going to be great over time. And a good name is just going to help you, but I don't think a bad name is going to kill a good company.

Lenny (00:29:51):
So interesting. So basically your goal is to help find a name that will help. Worst case, you're going to be okay if your product is awesome.

Arielle Jackson (00:29:59):
I think so. Yeah. I mean it also takes a little of the pressure off to be honest. Everyone wants to find that perfect name. If you actually think about it, this happens a lot. You give someone a list of 10 names or 15 names and they're just cells in the spreadsheet these days, we're doing most of this virtually. You give people a name like that and it's like, you have to imagine what it could be. You think about Apple or Disney or Nike or Volvo, Lego, any of these brands, in a cell spreadsheet in plain Arial in 10 point, they're just okay, you have to grow them over time. You just hear about I think Phil Nate with Nike, when he was given that name as an option, he was like, that's okay. Yeah. I'll sleep on it. Such a great name.

Lenny (00:30:50):
This makes me think about my startup back in the day, it was called Local Mind, and we went through an exercise similar to this. Not nearly as in depth and well run, but I remember our designer was the person that helped us nail the name. He's just like, oh, I could do so much with this name. Let's just see where this one can go. Is that something you find?

Arielle Jackson (00:31:10):
Yeah. There's definitely been bad names. I helped a company rebrand recently that they had a bad name. It just looked dated. It didn't fit any of those. It wasn't distinctive. It wasn't timeless. It had one of those like naming trends. Those are not good. You want to avoid those, but if you come up with something that is pretty good and you can make up something beautiful out of it and it fits your company, it does some of the marketing work for you and people like to say it and ideally it's memorable and it has some emotion to it, go, go for it.

Lenny (00:31:39):
Awesome. One last question about naming. What's a common mistake that people make going through this process coming up with a name?

Arielle Jackson (00:31:47):
Yeah, a really funny one is if you have a code name for your product or at First Round, a lot of the companies we invest in, they raise their seed round with one name. They may or may not be attached to it, but then they work with me and I'm like, yeah, your name's not that good, and here's why, we should probably change it or they say, we can't use this name. We found out we have a trademark conflict. I really believe in using a code name that's so ridiculous that you won't ever launch a product like that if you're just trying to incorporate and go really quick.

Arielle Jackson (00:32:18):
So for example, a lot of people, they need their name for their corporation. And so they are filing all the steps to creating a business and they just like pick something, but then they end up getting attached to it and then they want to actually launch under that name. And it's like, well, that's not so great and here's why I think you should change it. If you pick something so ridiculous that you would never launch, it's actually helpful because then you can go through a process and find a name that will do more of your work for you and you won't be attached to something crappy.

Lenny (00:32:50):
Such a good point an idea. And by the way, so if you're a First Round company, you get this naming service for free and all these other things we're going to talk about just to be clear.

Arielle Jackson (00:32:59):
Yes, that's right.

Lenny (00:33:00):
Oh my God. I could do a whole episode about how much I love First Round, but I will say I'm a huge fan. I think I've participated in every program that First Round offers. The First Round review is actually one of the first pieces of writing that kind of helped spur my now career. And so I'm really-

Arielle Jackson (00:33:15):
I remember that article, was awesome.

Lenny (00:33:17):
Yeah. And I did two more after that. So much work, but yeah, that was a big deal. So I'm really appreciative to First Round. And we could talk about First Round a bit at the end, too.

Arielle Jackson (00:33:26):
Sure. Yeah. Everything we're talking about that you've asked me so far, I think that you're going to ask me about positioning and [inaudible 00:33:33] your marketing person, and all of that is stuff we offer to First Round company, we offer my services as part of the investment. There are times when we might get stuck and we have to bring in an outside person to help us with something, but for the most part, it's all included and you'd pay a lot of money... The naming firm I like the best when I get stuck, it's called A Hundred Monkeys. They're awesome. A long time ago, I used to be like, oh yeah, it's about $25,000. And I recently couldn't take on an outsider First Round project and referred it to them. It's $47,000 for a name.

Lenny (00:34:04):
Wow.

Arielle Jackson (00:34:05):
So yeah, it's gotten expensive, but if you have the means, it's nice to get some outside help.

Lenny (00:34:12):
#valueadd. Okay. I want to transition to your brand development framework, which I read a bunch about. And I know you teach a course about this, which we could also chat a bit about, but first I'm curious, just practically, why is a brand useful? Why is it even something people should spend time investing in? Why does it matter?

Arielle Jackson (00:34:33):
Okay. So a lot of founders may think that when we say your brand, we mean your logo and your font and your colors, and that is a visual expression of your brand, but it's not actually your brand, your brand is who people think you are. And so why is it important for people to think what you want them to think? That really comes down to people's understanding and particularly your target audience's understanding of what your company and your product is. And I don't really think there's anything else more important than that if I was building a company.

Arielle Jackson (00:35:08):
So your brand is who people think you are and developing a brand strategy is what do you want to be? What do you want people to think you are? And what are you going to do to help shape that perception? So when I work on a company, there's a lot of steps to this, but I kind of have this nice little process that's right sized for early stage startups. And I like to start with, why do you do what you do? Just having a really clear understanding of that. That's your purpose. The second part is your product positioning. So meaning how do you want people to understand your product and what role it plays in their lives? And then the last part is your personality, which is how do you show up in the world? What do you like? If your brand was a person, would I want to hang out with them? Would someone else want to hang out with them?

Lenny (00:36:02):
We're going to get into each of these three pieces, but before we get in there, as a founder, how do you know when you're done with your brand development? I know it's a never ending ongoing process, but at the end of a process, you figure out your purpose, positioning, and personality, and then there's logo and colors, when you think about just here's the brand package, what are all the little pieces of it? And then we'll dive into these three elements.

Arielle Jackson (00:36:30):
I think what you said is right. You get those three components, your purpose, your positioning, your personality, you use that as an informant to your visual design and also to your tone of voice. So the way your copy sounds, the way you show up in written copy. A lot of companies have what they call like a style guide or a brand style guide and it really only covers logo, fonts, colors, like don't put our logo and blue, don't tilt it on an angle, here's what it looks like in white, here's what it looks like in black, here's the favicon, but they don't have that for here's who we are, here's 10 lines that could be ad copy for us, here is why we do what we do.

Arielle Jackson (00:37:14):
This is the personality of our brand. Here are five attributes. We are playful, but not silly. We can talk about that a little bit more. But I think all of that belongs in the style guide, not just logo, font colors, which is really just a visual articulation that feeds into your brand. I'm a big Volvo fan. I'm on my fourth Volvo right now. So I'm super brand loyal. And I always use them as an example, because if you can picture the Volvo logo in your head right now, it kind of looks like the male symbol, it's like a circle with an arrow coming off the side.

Arielle Jackson (00:37:48):
There's nothing about that logo that means all the things I like about Volvo, all the things that the Volvo brand has come to mean to me and they're colors, they're like black and white and a little blue. There's nothing more boring than their color palette. And so it's not the logo and the font and the colors of Volvo that has made them mean... They literally own the word safety in cars right now. It's other stuff. And if you looked at their style guide actually, looked at their style guide recently and it's just like, here's our black and our white and our blue and here's our tertiary colors and here's our logo. It would not help you understand Volvo as a brand.

Lenny (00:38:29):
I'm guessing some of that happened because they've evolved over the years and it's probably a very different initial brand. So it kind of tells me that it's more important to have a logo and a brand that can kind of represent many things that isn't so stuck in a certain positioning, maybe. Does that resonate at all?

Arielle Jackson (00:38:44):
Yeah. Their logo has to do with a very early history. I researched this because I was a nerd out on this stuff. They had some early history as a ball bearings company. And so I guess that logo had some meaning then, but it wasn't so descriptive to being a ball bearing company that they were able to keep it as they evolved into a car company.

Arielle Jackson (00:39:05):
But if you look at their early writing, it's so cool. It's so cool. Long, long time ago they would talk about cars are driven by humans. And our job as a car manufacturer is to protect the humans who drive the cars. That was fundamental formation of the company. So they really knew why they existed. And then they did stuff in I think it was the 1950s when everyone just wore lap bands in the car and they came out with the three point safety harness and instead of patenting it and licensing it, they gave that away for free for everyone because that would make all the world's cars safer and those kinds of company decisions. That's what made Volvo stand for safety. It's not the logo.

Lenny (00:39:48):
Very interesting.

Lenny (00:39:50):
This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris, and Lex Fridman, and so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One with a small scoop that dissolves in water. You are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on latest science research studies and internal testing that they do.

Lenny (00:40:39):
And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day. And that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. Make it easy. Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:41:10):
Again, that's athletic greens.com/lenny to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

Lenny (00:41:18):
One question on my mind before we get into these three elements, last question kind of setting context is if I'm a non founder or a PM, I'm just like, oh my God, a branding exercise is going to take months going to suck up all these resources. I don't know what it's going to do for us. What kind of timeframe do you recommend for early stage companies to go through kind of a branding exercise and go through something like this and maybe even later stage, what's reasonable?

Arielle Jackson (00:41:45):
Yeah. It depends on the stage of your company and how much you have already that you have to kind of... It's hard for people to scrap up what they already have. There's a lot of sunk cost fallacy type stuff going on. If you're starting from nothing, I think you can do this in three weeks. The naming process itself because of trademark and domains can take a little longer. When I name companies, it usually takes about a month just for naming, but the whole brand strategy process you could do, if you're a really early stage company in a matter of weeks.

Arielle Jackson (00:42:15):
And I think whatever time it takes you actually is going to save you so much time down the road. It's going to help you save time on company decision making. It's going to help you save time, writing your website. Literally your web copy almost writes itself, if you get this all done right. So it's a small investment of time up front that actually saves you a lot of time down the road is how I would sell it to a skeptical PM.

Lenny (00:42:40):
You've sold it. That sounds very high ROI. Let's get into it.

Arielle Jackson (00:42:43):
High ROI.

Lenny (00:42:43):
So purpose is the first piece. What is that? And then what are some examples of really good executions of purpose that you've seen?

Arielle Jackson (00:42:50):
Sure. So your purpose is why you do what you do. It makes people want to root for you. And it has a big role in aligning people to come want to work for you and to have employees all feel like they're part of something. I like to think of it as we exist to blank. And whatever that blank is your purpose. Do you want to hear about examples or do you want to hear about what makes a good purpose?

Lenny (00:43:14):
Both would be most excellent.

Arielle Jackson (00:43:16):
So a good purpose, it explains the change you want to see in the world irrespective of financial gain. So people often get hung up on mission and vision and values and all this stuff. And values are fine. They're internal. I'm not going to talk about those today, but I don't care about mission and vision. I just want one thing because people can only remember one thing and it's your purpose and it's why you do what you do. And when you articulate this really well, it helps you make company decisions, it exists on a 10 year frame. So everything we talk about with product positioning, it's pretty malleable. It exists on an 18 month frame if you're a early stage company, so it can evolve, whereas your purpose is pretty much going to stay the same for 10 years. It's that north star.

Arielle Jackson (00:44:03):
And it helps align people in the company and it helps the public want you to win. I worked at Google right out of grad school and Google's purpose was to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And I thought every company had a purpose that everyone at the company knew. I just thought that was my first real job. It turns out that's not true. And Google's actually been amazing at this. I had a person in my last cohort who had recently left Google when they were like, I don't know, 80 or a hundred thousand people. He said everyone still can say that. That's amazing. But I joined, it was like 1400 people. And by the time of your first day, you already knew that. It was part of your hiring process.

Arielle Jackson (00:44:51):
It was part of your onboarding. It was in your offer letter. It was everywhere. And I just thought that was really cool and a good purpose. One that is kind of related to financial gain, but I still think is cool is Stripe's, which is to increase the GDP of the internet. I think that's really well said and cool and just gets you thinking about the internet as a country. I don't know. If you're an internet person, it makes you want to root for them.

Arielle Jackson (00:45:21):
Nike's is awesome. I wrote Nike's down because I don't remember it, to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And if you have a body, you are an athlete. It's not just about LeBron it's about me and how was my Peloton ride this morning too? So those are some famous companies. I could tell you a little bit about some that I've worked on that I think are pretty cool that are companies you may not have heard of yet, just because sometimes we get hung up in like thinking Stripe and Nike and Google are awesome names because of all the meaning we have behind them. And I want to talk about some companies you may not have heard of because you can have a good purpose and not be Stripe and Nike and Google.

Lenny (00:46:07):
Yeah. That'd be awesome. And by the way, the purpose, should it be a sentence? Is that the general-

Arielle Jackson (00:46:08):
Yes.

Lenny (00:46:08):
... guideline. Great.

Arielle Jackson (00:46:09):
So you can introduce yourself at a conference. You're the keynote speaker at a conference and I want you to introduce yourself and I want you to go, hi, I'm Lenny, I'm the founder of the company X, and we exist to blah and say it and have that feel natural.

Lenny (00:46:21):
Awesome.

Arielle Jackson (00:46:22):
And it should make people want to hear what else you have to say. And the other thing it should be able to do is be the header for your about page. So meaning we exist to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But you would just take out the we exist and say the verb and start there. That could be the header for your about page. So one company I worked on, First Round company, they're called LogicLoop and it's an operations automation company.

Arielle Jackson (00:46:48):
You can think of it almost stuff like a no code, low code platform to automate a lot of the operations data based work that people have to do. And we did this whole brainstorm and I really liked their purpose. You can look at their about page. It will be right there it's to make operations data work harder than operations people. And if you ever have worked in operations or have friends who have, they work really, really hard and it can be kind of thankless. So it gets anyone in that field to root for you. Your data should be working harder than your operations people.

Lenny (00:47:21):
Disclaimer, I'm an investor in LogicLoop, and I love that you worked with them.

Arielle Jackson (00:47:24):
Cool. Awesome. And then another one that I worked on of another First Round company, they're called Woolf. They're informed by the UC model where there's a bunch of individual schools that all exist by themselves, but they get something from being part of a larger organization. And what they do is they provide accreditation through being part of the larger Woolf University, but every individual college can still operate as their own independent college.

Arielle Jackson (00:47:52):
And so their purpose is to increase access to world class higher education and ensure that it is globally recognized and transferable. So this idea of you should be able to take a class from the best instructor online and then go travel to Australia and take a class there and then go to China and take a class there and get the best education that the world can offer.

Arielle Jackson (00:48:15):
Another one that I worked on a while ago is Alt. I think they've recently gone through a little bit of like a rebranding, but theirs was to increase the transparency and liquidity of alternative assets. And in their case, the product positioning was really about making sports cards as easy to invest in as stocks. So the idea of alternative assets in this case are not private equity and hedge funds in real estate, but alternatives to alternatives, like sports cards and Pokemon cards and art.

Lenny (00:48:45):
Awesome. Those are so many awesome examples. That's going to be useful for people to wrap their head around what a purpose might be. Execution wise, do you just kind of open up a Google doc and just start writing out ideas and brainstorm a little bit and just kind of keep refining with your team?

Arielle Jackson (00:48:58):
I actually stole this exercise or borrowed it from [inaudible 00:49:03] that I actually think adds some structure to that. If you do it that way and it works for you, that's awesome. But if you want to go in and go through a process to get there, what I like to do is list all of the cultural tensions that are happening in the world that are relevant to your business first. And so for Alt, that would be things like there's an increase in interest in alternatives. People who are now in their 30s are nostalgic for things that happened in the '90s There is at the time really low interest rates and people are not getting any sort of edge off of investing in the things that their parents used to invest in. So those would be examples of cultural tensions. Cultural tensions are zeitgeist, their things that your audience might be thinking of.

Arielle Jackson (00:49:51):
They're things that they may be even subconscious to them, their current events. So you make a long list of all of those. Then you make a long list of all the ways that you might describe your brand's best self. And this is related to your product positioning, but let's say you haven't done yet, so just think of it as your brand's best self. How would we want someone to describe us? When everything works perfectly, and our product really delivers, what does it deliver? And again, bullets, just ways that you would talk about that. And then you pick one from each side, that's really the best articulation of what's happening in the world, what your product delivers, and with that context, now you're primed.

Arielle Jackson (00:50:30):
With that context in mind, now you do the brainstorm of, we exist to let me finish this sentence, and even before you get there, sometimes it's helpful to do the world would be a better place if. So for my company, the world would be a better place if, and finish that sentence and then go into the we exist to.

Lenny (00:50:49):
Wow. I'm so happy I asked that question. By the way, is there also a place we can point people to that want to do this exercise? Is there another First Round interview post, or I know you have a course on this too.

Arielle Jackson (00:50:59):
Yeah. There's another First Round review article it's called Three Moves Every Startup Founder Should Make, something like that

Lenny (00:51:07):
Great. I will find it and I'll add it.

Arielle Jackson (00:51:09):
Yeah. Okay. Awesome.

Lenny (00:51:10):
Amazing. Okay. Let's move on to the next part, which is around positioning, which is a big deal. First, just what is positioning? And then I'd love to know just what tells you may have a positioning problem, that's something you should really focus on?

Arielle Jackson (00:51:23):
Okay. So positioning is the space that you occupy in your target customer's mind and everything you can do to influence how they describe your product. You have a positioning problem if I ask 10 of your customers or 10 of your employees what the company does or what the product does. And I get multiple answers. And unfortunately that's the case for most companies. It's okay if the answers are tiny slight variance on the same thing, but I have actually done this with some later stage companies [inaudible 00:52:01] my first step is often I go in and I interview 10 people, and the 10 people are everyone from execs to people who talk to customers to a few customers. And when you get 10 people saying 10 wildly different things, you have a positioning problem. Other ways you might know that if you have a positioning problem is if you can't explain what you do to me in a sentence that's, you have a positioning problem.

Lenny (00:52:25):
That's a high bar.

Arielle Jackson (00:52:26):
Yeah, it is. And when I first started consulting, I would spend the first meeting with a founder, just totally cold. Hey, tell me about your company. And they would take 30 minutes to tell me about their company. And at the end of 30 minutes, I would pretty much get it, but it always took the first 30 minutes. So now when I engage with a new company, I have them fill out this little worksheet beforehand. And one of the questions is what do you do? And they have to write in a box that's kind of paragraph length.

Lenny (00:52:55):
Clever.

Arielle Jackson (00:52:56):
And then I go in and I ask questions about that. And ultimately we get it to sentence length.

Lenny (00:53:00):
Amazing. Okay. How do you go about figuring out your positioning? Big question.

Arielle Jackson (00:53:05):
Yeah. So I start with your audience. Who's this for? And we really think about what's the broadest set of customers or users that you might have and narrow in from there to a target audience, which is who are you outwardly going to try to acquire for the next 18 months?

Arielle Jackson (00:53:25):
You can think of it like concentric circles. The biggest circle is your TAM. As you get smaller, there's five parts to it. So the biggest circle is circle one, circle two, circle three, circle four is your target audience. All of the circles have to be contained within the bigger circle. And then the dot in the middle is your model persona. So this is actually like a person with a name and an age and a location and a job and feelings and priorities and interests and all of that.

Arielle Jackson (00:53:54):
And so we talk about the model user and the target audience, the target audience again is who will you outwardly try to acquire for the next 18 months? If you're an early stage company, it's very possible that you're going to acquire people outside of that circle, in the next circle or even the bigger circle, but they're not who you're actively going out to try to acquire.

Lenny (00:54:15):
Can I ask you a couple questions on the person?

Arielle Jackson (00:54:17):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:18):
I'm doing some writing and research into this stuff. How specific do you suggest people get with this person right at the middle? I love that it's an actual person, I guess not a real person, but a very descriptive [crosstalk 00:54:29]

Arielle Jackson (00:54:29):
Can be a real person or an amalgamation of not real people. So with the target audience, I like to think of it as something you could name. So with Eero, it was tech savvy dads. It's a category of people. And then the model persona, or that individual user who represents a tech savvy dad for them was this guy who had teenage kids lived in suburban St. Louis, had a 2,800 Square foot house that was made of brick, worked at home on Fridays. His kids were into gaming. He was the VP of sales at a company that was tech adjacent, but not tech. He was more of like a tech enthusiast than an actual software engineer. We knew a lot about him. I could tell you a lot about him. It's kind of robust, but tech savvy dads was the way to represent him and other people like him, that would be their target audience.

Lenny (00:55:22):
A lot of founders have trouble recognizing that going very focused and niche is a good idea versus man, I'm just going to have these 10 people in the world that really want what I want. What have you found to be the reason it's very powerful and important to start really focused?

Arielle Jackson (00:55:37):
Yeah. So when you are an early stage company, the worst thing you can do is try to be everything to everyone because you don't have enough runway. You just don't have enough of anything to do that successfully. The best thing you can do is find an audience that is big enough, that if you got your significant market share among that audience, you'd be a giant business. And tech savvy dads is a pretty big audience. Also that's just who your outbound going to try to acquire for the next 18 months. I'm a tech savvy mom. I live with a tech savvy dad. I have an Eero system. It doesn't mean everyone you'll ever acquire must be in that audience, it means that is who we're focused on acquiring.

Lenny (00:56:24):
Awesome. I took us off course around the positioning process. I think we kind of went off course with concentric circles model. So I'll give it back to you to keep going.

Arielle Jackson (00:56:36):
Yeah. Okay. So the way that I like to run positioning exercise is to start with who is this for? And then what is the problem that they have? There's some problem usually that these people have, they may not even be aware it's a problem, or they may not be experiencing the problem as particularly troubling, but there's something going on for these people. And then how do they address that problem today? So they do something, they're buying something, they're have a workaround, they're doing something today. And that something might not be another startup or your direct competitor. It might be the old way of doing things, but they're doing something. So we go through who is it for? What's their problem? How do they address it? And then what do you make?

Arielle Jackson (00:57:20):
How does it work? And what would you want a user of your product or service to tell another? And that's kind of if you answer all of those questions, it ultimately leads into this classic four statement, which is not something I invented, it's something that's been around for 40 or 50 years. And I learned it when I was 22. And I think it's one of the most powerful tools in marketing. It can feel like mad libs if you just approach it cold. But if you've gone through that work of defining who is it and what's their problem, all it is a distillation of that. So that statement is for target audience who there's a statement of need or opportunity. And then you say our product name is a category that has a benefit, unlike the old thing they were doing, our product works this other way.

Lenny (00:58:10):
Awesome. And we'll link to the post that actually has that so people don't have to write this all down. That last piece you mentioned, I hadn't heard before, the idea of what will they tell other people or how will they describe it to other people? Is that right?

Arielle Jackson (00:58:22):
Yeah. So I believe that great benefits if you've defined your benefit really, really well will actually be the thing that will be the H1 on your homepage and will be the thing that you want someone to tell someone else. Think about Square Stand and turn your iPad into a point of sale. Turn your iPad into a point of sale. Yeah. If I went to a small business owner and they were having drinks with a friend, who's also a small business owner, what would I want them to say about the Square Stand? Oh yeah. I just got the Square Stand. It's this really cool new register that turns my iPad into a point of sale. That's pretty much exactly what I want them to say. And so if you can write that line, that is your ideal benefit, what you want people to say, and it's something that your target audience would actually say, that's great.

Lenny (00:59:12):
Interesting. I love that. That makes a lot of sense. For people trying to go through this exercise, you always have such a good answers to how actually the process of coming up with say you're positioning this case, is it again, you pull up a doc and start writing things or is there something even more structured?

Arielle Jackson (00:59:28):
Yeah. There's something more structured. I have kind of a worksheet that goes through all those things we just talked about. So it's like, who is it for? What are they doing today? All those questions we just talked about, it's more like a structured brainstorm. There's an exercise I really love that I've called the bar test that is helping you get everything you've written into human language because one of the really big pitfalls I see, especially for B2B companies, but really for everyone is they write in a way that people don't talk. So the document, when I get the first draft back from founders often has things like leverages and empowers and nobody talks like that. And so getting this into turns your iPad into a point of sale blankets your home in fast, reliable wifi, records your screen and cam at the same time, really basic stuff that it describes your product in a way that someone would actually say that's the type of language that I think people want to use.

Arielle Jackson (01:00:28):
First of all, you defined your target. Now you pretend to be someone in your target, having drinks with someone else in your target at a bar and you have to be able to say, hey, I just started using product name. It's this really great category, that benefit. And the other person goes, hm, tell me more or that's cool, what do you mean? Or some other similar prompts. And then you have to say your differentiator. You actually have to say it out loud. And if you run through that test and it's actually stuff people would say out loud, then you've done a pretty good job and you can start using that copy publicly.

Lenny (01:01:07):
That is very cool. I have not heard this bar test before and I like that it might happen at an actual bar. Is that also something people can find online or is that they write it down right now?

Arielle Jackson (01:01:18):
Ooh, I don't know if that's online.

Lenny (01:01:20):
Okay, cool. This is it. Exclusive.

Arielle Jackson (01:01:22):
Yeah, that's in my course, and we talk a lot about that and we go through the exercise like a real role play in the course, but yeah, take some notes.

Lenny (01:01:31):
I like that a lot.

Arielle Jackson (01:01:33):
Thanks.

Lenny (01:01:33):
Your point reminded me of an email I just pulled up that I got from ADP, your point about just you want to make sure you're branding is something that feels like something you would say to a person. So it's like ADP, which is a security service for fire, like alarms. I got this email, summer's on with fun or our free secure app and more. And then it's like make summer safer and more fun at home or away. ADP, you're not going to make it more fun. What are you talking about?

Arielle Jackson (01:02:01):
See, that's an example of trying too hard. They tried too hard to make it sound colloquial and fun. They're a security system, it should be more like secure your home while you're away. Feel safe when you're on your summer trip. Stuff like that.

Lenny (01:02:16):
They even included a gif of this TikTok'er being like ADP is my MVP.

Arielle Jackson (01:02:21):
Yeah. This kind of relates to brand personality where the brand personality for ADP, I don't know, it's pretty not fun. And so for them, when they put on fun hat, it seems awkward and forced.

Lenny (01:02:36):
That's exactly the feeling I got. And so, yeah, personality, that's our next topic. It's not something I you think about when you think about brand and marketing and plans and so I'm really curious to hear why I think that's important then how to figure out your own personality for your brand.

Arielle Jackson (01:02:51):
So I think personality is one of those inputs that will help define your visual design and it will definitely help define your written copy. And it really comes from this idea of brands are like people. And if you start thinking of your brand more like a person, it's quite obvious that it needs a personality, because all people have personalities. And these days, especially when brands show up in places where people show up, like TikTok and Instagram, your brand certainly needs a personality or else you end up like ADP trying to be fun for the summer, which just feels really off and weird. So personality is one of those things that it's actually the easiest part. I think it's the fastest part. It often ends up an hour and you can get it done. But I have some frameworks I like to use that really just get at are you Mountain Dew or are you Rolex or are you somewhere in between?

Arielle Jackson (01:03:46):
And when you think about brands that have a lot of equity, they really do have a personality. I often talk about Mountain Dew marketing as that marketing that's like trying really hard to be cool and rugged and edgy and fast and kind of teen and Rolex, it's very like Gray Poupon, oh, roll down your window and do you have any Gray Poupon, it's fancy and sophisticated and a little bit aspirational and maybe even a little British. And those two things are really, really, really different. And there's a lot in the middle and not everyone's going to be a Mountain Dew or Rolex, but where are you? And so you can just write it down. I think a lot of these answers come back to like, if you are good with just opening a blank Google doc and like writing down who you are by all means, go for it.

Arielle Jackson (01:04:35):
And if that feels daunting and hard for you, use a framework. And the framework that I like to use has two parts. The first part is based on some academic research by Jennifer Aker and it basically analyzed the top brands in the world and figured out that all brands can be segmented into five dimensions of brand personality. And that really strong brand spike in two of the five. So the five dimensions that she found were sincerity, so this is like, is it down to earth and honest, excitement, it's spirited, this is a Mountain Dew thing, competence, reliable and intelligent, sophisticated, sophistication, which is a charming and upper class and rugged outdoorsy and tough. So sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness. And going back to those two brands we just discussed Mountain Dew is rugged and exciting, Rolex is sophisticated and competent and you can do this with any brand who admire or just think about brands you like and kind of deduce them to their two of those five.

Arielle Jackson (01:05:39):
So that's the first step. Which two of those five are you going to spike in? And it turns out a lot of tech companies end up spiking in sincerity and competence just usually does happen that way. Amazon is sincere and competent. Google is sincere and competent. Apple is not, Apple has a little more of that sophistication to it. But in any case, if you just did that, we would end in a world where everyone's sincere and competent or maybe sophisticated and competent. It's like a really boring world. So the next step after you do that is to define five attributes, five brand personalities, thinking about those two dimensions. I like to think about this as a star, five point star and brands need tension to be interesting. So if you tell me we're helpful, we're nice, we're approachable, we're competent, and we're reliable.

Arielle Jackson (01:06:37):
You basically haven't told me anything because you just use three words to say one thing and two words to say another thing. Whereas if you tell me, oh, well we're really savvy, but we're also really approachable. That's kind of cool. Because people who are expert are always approachable. They have to have a little tension and then you want to write them as statements that say we are X, but not Y, where Y is taking X too far. So in the example Google is playful but not silly, so they would say we are playful, but not silly, or maybe Mountain Dew would say we are daring, but not stupid. So taking that attribute a little too far. And so yeah, then you end up with these five statements that are we are X, but not Y. And those are really useful in informing how you write and maybe even what your visual design would look like, and certainly what your illustration style photography style ad copy will be like.

Lenny (01:07:39):
Once you've gone through that exercise and in maybe the other two pieces, where do you put this? Is this just like in a doc that's like here's our brand overview, here's our personality, here's our positioning, here's our purpose. And then you refer back to that whenever you're designing and putting together strategies? Is that how it works?

Arielle Jackson (01:08:00):
Yeah, you could do it that way. That's definitely one way of doing it. That's a good start. I think that one other place where it shows up, like we talked about that visual style guide that everyone has, that they give to an agency or copywriter who's writing on their behalf. I think these should all be inputs into that doc that you end up sharing. I think it should go into any onboarding you do for new employees so that they understand who the company is. Any partners that you're marketing with, co-branding, all of that, it should really be think of it as your little brand Bible about who you are. And also it should be revisited when you're doing, let's say a new product or to make sure does this need to be updated or does this new product need to fit into who we are?

Lenny (01:08:40):
What do you call this document/place?

Arielle Jackson (01:08:44):
When I take all those three components and then add a bunch of other stuff, I call it a creative brief, which is the thing you would hand to an agency or a writer who's writing on your behalf. It would include some other things too, that we didn't talk about, like creative inspiration direction. So picking visual clips and written clips and all these things that you like and that you don't like, so you can show both positive examples and counter examples to the thing you're looking for.

Lenny (01:09:09):
Awesome. Thank you for all of that. There's so much juice there. I think people are going to have to listen to this a couple times to get all the learnings. Before I let you go, there's two other areas I wanted to dive into. But I'll keep them brief because I know we're going long. One is about getting PR and just a question I wanted to ask you while I had you, founders and even bigger companies, they're always like, how do I get PR? How do I get press for my product, even though it's sometimes a waste of time. Do you have just any tactical advice for startups hoping to get some PR?

Arielle Jackson (01:09:43):
You mean initial coverage around a launch or ongoing?

Lenny (01:09:47):
I'd say early on, yeah, before the launch.

Arielle Jackson (01:09:49):
Sure. So the first one is to get your story straight. So, so many times I have founders come to me and they're like, hey, we need help with this announcement. I'm like, cool. What's the announcement? And back to the 30 minutes until I understand what the company is, so if you can't describe it to me in a sentence, your reporter is certainly not going to understand in a sentence and they won't be able to describe it to their audience in a sentence. And so really getting your story straight, all the stuff we talked about specifically around product positioning is so key. Almost always when someone comes to me and says, I'm ready to announce, we go back to positioning first. Also make sure that your website is ready for the traffic you're going to drive to it, that you're not driving traffic to a name that you're going to later scrap.

Arielle Jackson (01:10:32):
Are you really ready for this? So go back to all the other things we discussed first and then having realistic expectations about the outlets that will cover you and the time it will take to get them. So a lot of people will be like, I'm launching next week. And it's like, well, cool that you're doing that, but no reporters going to cover you next week. It just doesn't work like that anymore. Five years ago, eight years ago, founders could really dictate the date of a launch announcement, they could brief three to five outlets under embargo, which means like you all can't tell our secret news until we tell you at this time you can publish. And at that time, three of the five would all file a story and write, and it just doesn't work like that anymore. These days for early stage startups, we're almost always running the launch announcement as an exclusive, which means you give the news to a single outlet.

Arielle Jackson (01:11:19):
And they're the only ones who get to write about it. You can obviously still do all your owned and operated stuff, your blog, your social, your investors, your friends and family, but they're the only like news outlet who gets to write about it. So having an expectation that this is probably going to be an exclusive, it's harder than ever to secure funding for a seed stage company and funding in and of itself is not that interesting anymore. There's so many bad companies getting funding. There's so many good companies getting funding too just more than ever. And the number of reporters and the number of outlets that are covering it is just less than it used to be. So really just thinking about like, well, who writes about this space? Do they write about company's at my stage?

Arielle Jackson (01:12:08):
That's another really big one is, hey, we want the New York Times. It's like, cool, no one's at the New York Times has ever covered a seed stage startup unless it's crazy for the last five years. Who do you think is going to write about you? But there are still outlets that do. The other one is don't do a straight funding announcement. A lot of founders raise money and they're like, cool, let's announce. It's like, no, we'll use that funding announcement as a news hook to tell a larger story and a larger story might be your products available. You have reference customers, you have momentum, you have some great partnership that you're announcing. There's something else going on, not just your funding and using your funding as part of that initial launch is great, but what else are you announcing?

Arielle Jackson (01:12:55):
The last thing is really about making what you do interesting and relevant so that it's not just interesting and relevant to you and the three other people who worked there at the time, but interesting to all the readers of whatever outlet you're trying to target. And so an example of that is I worked on this company, Vitable Health and the founder, Joseph, he created a product for hourly workers that their employer would buy and it costs like $50 per person per month. And what it does is it provides urgent care and primary care. So these hourly workers who make too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to pay their health insurance premiums, and so primary and urgent care for hourly workers. And we tied it into this idea of the great resignation and small businesses not being able to hire hourly workers, which was like a big trend end of 2021, and the company operates in Philadelphia and Delaware, and we were actually able to get him the Sunday after Christmas, Philadelphia Inquirer story.

Arielle Jackson (01:13:57):
But it was all about making this daycare and this restaurant in Philadelphia into heroes because they offered this cool benefit to their hourly workers. And so the headline was perfect for them, but it wasn't like here's Vitable and here's what they announced and here's, it was like, hey, look at this cool new thing that local businesses are doing to attract hourly workers. And so think about your company in a way to make it interesting and relevant and don't sleep on local preps.

Arielle Jackson (01:14:23):
If you have a local business or a local story or local customers, this was a huge thing at Square. We turned all of our customers into heroes and went after local press. Most PR firms that service the tech community aren't experts in local press, but if you have a way to make some connections with some local press, they are the ones hungry for these stories more than the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Lenny (01:14:50):
What a good tip and most likely they're much more open to writing about you versus New York Times or Wall Street Journal. Cool. Okay. So I want to ask you one question about hiring marketing real quick and I'll keep it short just because I know we're going to run out of time. When should a startup hire a full-time marketing person in your experience?

Arielle Jackson (01:15:08):
When you have a lot of problems that you're trying to solve that would be better solved by someone who knew what they're doing, or when you have a bunch of freelancers and agencies that are becoming too hard to manage by yourself.

Lenny (01:15:21):
When do you find that usually ends up being... Is there kind of a heuristic-

Arielle Jackson (01:15:25):
Yeah. Ballpark, it kind of depends if you're a marketing driven business or a sales driven business. So if you're a sales driven business and you don't have a repeatable sales motion, it's not yet time to hire a marketer, get that repeatable sales motion, and marketing's job is to bring you more marketing qualified leads. So that's one, so that kind of depends. If you're a marketing driven business, it generally seems to me like it happens around 10 people, the founders doing most of this themselves, they're not doing the best job usually or they've hired agency here, a freelancer there to kind of cobble some stuff together. And they now realize like, okay, if I had a person who would be able to do all of this and manage these agencies and freelancers, this would be a lot better.

Arielle Jackson (01:16:13):
It also is do you have a one point in time project? Do you need to do positioning? Do you need a website? Do you need a name? Do you need to run a test of Google ads? Those things are all discreet when it becomes this is ongoing work that needs to happen over time. It's better to think about hiring a marketer and really what kind of marketer do you need? Do you need a product marketer, a performance marketer, a comms person, a creative person? Ideally everyone wants all of that. But I kind of like that idea of a T-shaped marketer who's really deep on one of those functions, but knows enough to be dangerous across all of them.

Lenny (01:16:48):
I think we're going to need another episode just about that one topic. I have so many questions I want to ask, but I need to let you go. That'll be V2. Before we do that, we've gotten to the very exciting lightning round where I'm just going to ask you quick questions and you just give me a quick answer and we will knock through them all. Does that sound good?

Arielle Jackson (01:17:06):
Sounds great.

Lenny (01:17:07):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Arielle Jackson (01:17:09):
In marketing land, definitely the book called Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. It's from 1980, it's still my favorite marketing book. Another recent marketing book is Alchemy by Rory Sutherland. It's like my favorite area of reading is behavioral science, psychology meets business. And that's in there. For fiction, I just read The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett. It was awesome. I then read her other book called The Mothers, but I think The Vanishing Half's better.

Lenny (01:17:36):
Awesome. I will check that out. What's a favorite podcast or even newsletter on marketing?

Arielle Jackson (01:17:41):
I love Nick Sharma's weekly newsletter. He's a growth marketer. He started his career I think at [inaudible 01:17:48] water. So he does a lot of CPG type DTC. He has a great marketing newsletter that comes out every Sunday night. On podcasts, I love How I Built This. I know that's already really popular, but I love that one. It's not really marketing, but just general business. The First Round podcast in depth is pretty great. Lenny's podcast I've been listening to is awesome. And then my friend Jasmine from The Concept Bureau has a marketing podcast called Unseen, Unknown. And it's kind of about culture and branding and how these things and society and trends. It's not like straight marketing. It's kind of more of the culture and sociology that informs marketing.

Lenny (01:18:30):
Wow. That is a lot of good stuff. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've loved?

Arielle Jackson (01:18:35):
This is more embarrassing. How many movies have you seen in the last year? Just curious.

Lenny (01:18:41):
Me? A lot, on streaming services. Way too many also, if that's where you're going or have you seen none?

Arielle Jackson (01:18:48):
Well, I've seen maybe four and they're probably all on Disney+.

Lenny (01:18:53):
You're winning. That's excellent.

Arielle Jackson (01:18:56):
I would say I really like some of those Disney Pixar movies, Luca, Encanto. Those are all really great. I mostly only watch movies with my kids, but I'm pretty excited. I had a celebrity crush on Anthony Bourdain and I'm excited to watch his new documentary if I ever get around to it. And TV shows I'm equally bad.

Lenny (01:19:16):
Okay, great.

Arielle Jackson (01:19:16):
And there's this little Netflix show called Old Enough. It's a Japanese show with subtitles about sending toddlers on errands in Japan. They like go by themselves. It's 10 minutes. They're awesome. My whole family watched them together. It's really cute.

Lenny (01:19:29):
Old Enough. I'm going to check that out. Okay. Two more questions. Favorite interview question when hiring a marketing person?

Arielle Jackson (01:19:35):
It's probably tell me a project you're proud of. Tell me about a project you're proud of, is just really open-ended and get to hear a lot about a lot of things that way. And then maybe runner up is tell me about a campaign you recently come across that you were not involved with that you thought was cool.

Lenny (01:19:53):
Hmm. Love that. Okay. Final question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?

Arielle Jackson (01:20:01):
In the marketing industry?

Lenny (01:20:02):
In the marketing industry? Yeah, sure.

Arielle Jackson (01:20:04):
I guess old school thought leaders, David Ogilvy, Rory Sutherland, Seth Godin. New school thought leaders, we mentioned Nick Sharma. There's a woman named... I'm probably going to butcher her name, Anna Andjelic. She has a newsletter that I didn't mention before. It's called the Sociology of Business. That's really good. She's a CMO, chief brand officer type. She kind of turned around Banana Republic recently, which was cool. Emily Hayward from Red Antler. I also really like Ross. I don't know this guy, but Ross Simmons from Foundation, which is a content marketing agency. I'm not a content marketing expert, but he really is. And I think he puts out some good content.

Lenny (01:20:48):
Man, these show notes are going to be a long list of great stuff. Arielle, thank you so much for being here. There's just so much jampacked knowledge. I don't know if people were prepared when they started listening to this and so congrats on making it through and I hope you're probably going to go back and listen again and again. And so again, Arielle, thank you so much for doing this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or ask questions and how can listeners be useful to you?

Arielle Jackson (01:21:14):
Sure I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. Twitter, I'm hiimarielle. And if you're interested in this stuff, but feeling overwhelmed, I will plug my Maven course. I teach a course on startup brand strategy that covers everything we talked about in this hour, or this is more than an hour now and kind of with a little more hand holding and feedback. So it's a crash course on all this stuff. The four founders that takes two weeks and you go through all of this and that next cohort of that, I think we're on cohort four will be this fall. So you can apply for that course at maven.com/arielle/startupbrandstrategy.

Lenny (01:21:57):
Amazing. And I guess that's how listeners can be useful to you.

Arielle Jackson (01:22:00):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:22:01):
Excellent.

Arielle Jackson (01:22:01):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:22:02):
All right. Well great. All right, well thank you again, thank you again and [inaudible 01:22:07].

Arielle Jackson (01:22:07):
Thanks so much, Lenny. It was fun.

# The ultimate guide to Martech | Austin Hay (Reforge, Ramp, Runway)

## Transcript

Austin Hay (00:00:00):
From 2010 to 2020, we had the golden years of deterministic matching where it was very easy to run an ad and understand with precision who installed the app. Maybe you didn't know their name, but you actually would know their IDFA and you could tie that to their PII. You can't do that anymore. So, what that means is these ad networks are becoming more complex, sophisticated, and interesting, right at the same time that it's harder for marketers to really understand how they're spending money. And so I am paying a lot of attention to how marketers make decisions with probabilistic data because most of the work that I'm doing now is actually saying, well, given that we don't have determinist data about a per certain audience or where somebody came from, how can I find other information that will create a model for 30% of the population and we can use that to extrapolate to a hundred.

Lenny (00:00:52):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview you world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hardwood experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Austin Hay. Austin is one of the smartest people in the world on the field of MarTech, aka Marketing Technology. He's advised companies like Notion, Airbnb, Walmart, Postmates, Robinhood, even Pete's Coffee and Mars on their MarTech strategy and tactics. He's currently head of marketing technology at Ramp. Before that, he was VP of business operations at Runway. Before that, he was VP of growth at mParticle and the fourth employee at the Unicorn Branch Metrics. He's also a teacher at Reforge on this very topic of MarTech. In our conversation, Austin explains what exactly is MarTech, how it fits into your growth organization when you need to hire a MarTech person and what to look for plus his favorite interview questions.

(00:01:43):
Also, his favorite tools, frameworks, team structures, and emerging platforms that he's most excited about. This episode is for anyone who's responsible for growth and is curious about ways to optimize your approach and how marketing technology fits into that. Enjoy this episode with Austin Hay after a short word from our sponsors. Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sync for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is.

(00:02:28):
Companies like Scale AI and PAVE are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product.

Austin Hay (00:04:03):
Lenny. Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny (00:04:04):
We are going to get super nerdy today and we're going to dive deep into the very cool field of MarTech. How excited are you about us chatting about MarTech?

Austin Hay (00:04:15):
I'm so excited. Because it seems like you might be one of the first people in product and growth to talk about MarTech.

Lenny (00:04:21):
Wow, okay. That makes me even more excited. Yeah, it's something that I haven't fully understood and so I'm excited to dig real deep. So, let's start with just the basics. What exactly is MarTech and then what does someone who is in MarTech do?

Austin Hay (00:04:35):
Such a good question. Because marketing technology is like this very amorphous, cross-functional discipline that lives at the crossroads of product and growth and engineering and marketing. It brings together processes and systems from a wide range of disciplines. And I think really the way to think about marketing technology is it's a product manager whose specific role and focus is the system or the third party or first party platform because marketing technology can mean a collection of third party tools, which is a lot of people think, but as a company scales and grows actually it could include a collection of first party homegrown solutions that you build yourself with or in addition to third party. So, I like to think about marketing technology more as one piece is people and process and the other is the system and the platform. And that probably sounds pretty familiar to what a lot of product people think about their world as, and that's how I define MarTech.

(00:05:31):
And then you asked this other question around what exactly the role of somebody in MarTech, and maybe we'll talk about this a little later, but it's such a function of the size and the stage of the company that you're at. At Airbnb, I would say Dmitri who you might've worked with was the MarTech guide. He managed a lot of our Airbnb's, the first and third party tools. Airbnb at that size was, I don't know, maybe 800 people or so. And so it makes sense to have a function with product and engineering resources. A small startup for example, when I was working with Siqi, we were just talking about this at Runway, there was no such thing as MarTech. There was me and Tanner and Siqi standing up tools and using them because you just have to use the tools to get the job done. And so I would say on the spectrum of what is MarTech, you really have to look at the size and the stages of the company and as you grow you start to see it become more refined or pronounced.

Lenny (00:06:17):
So, if someone listening to this that has done growth or has a growth PM may be like, oh, but this is sort of what I do. What is the difference between someone that just runs growth or has a growth team versus someone that's specifically a MarTech person?

Austin Hay (00:06:30):
At some levels there's maybe no difference. There's a lot of startups I would say are 30 people or less where you have a growth team and your growth acquisition person is using a CDP to send data to their ad network to run their ads because that's part of their job and maybe they are the MarTech person. And actually you find a lot of people who consider themselves MarTech professionals now having started in growth or user acquisition roles because they had to just use tools in order to get their jobs done. But what I would say is as a company grows and scales, it moves from being a community or village driven aspect of your products to being something that's centrally owned. If you're a startup, again, like 30 to 40 people, everybody might chip in to manage your CDP or use Amplitude or build a first party solution on top of those.

(00:07:16):
It's a mixture of first and third party tools and engineering and product and marketing all work together on it. That doesn't scale though. As you cross a hundred to 200 people, somebody has to be responsible for knowing how data flows through tools, how it's worked, what's the schema. And that's not even considering procurement and legal stuff. You have infinite liability if you don't manage your contracts well. And so usually around I would call it a hundred to 150 people is the critical mass where you can't just have a village approach to systems and tools much like in the IT org, if it was a village approach to SSO businesses would be in a lot of danger. That's where you typically start to see the question of, all right, we need a systems and tools person. We need somebody to manage these systems and manage that platform.

(00:08:01):
And there's a variety of ways it can go. I've seen it go just into pure product that's with a product operations org and a product ops person actually will manage a lot of third and first party tools. I've seen it go into the IT org, Walmart for example, at a really big scale. They had a MarProd function which was marketing products. It was product within the marketing function or product that was designed to serve marketing. And then of course you can have more traditional routes like you can have marketing technology as a single standalone unit or business technology as a standalone unit. Some of this depends too on whether the business is B2C versus B2B. Classically in a B2B business you see it in rev ops or some types of systems role because you have to serve not only users coming into your funnel, but then the businesses that you're serving afterwards.

(00:08:46):
That's also where you typically see tools like Salesforce coming into play and more advanced CRMs. In a B2C business, your user funnel is actually really simple acquiring users and you're getting them into your product and then product is taking them over. There's no additional CRM, so usually your CDP is the source of truth and that's where you might actually see marketing technology fit in with growth a lot more. Just some examples like at Postmates, I worked for them for a long time as a consultant. Marketing technology was just part of growth. We had a director of growth even before that, Siqi Chen who's the CEO of runway, and I guess you were his first manager as I just learned, he was the first VP of growth and marketing technology was just part of growth and product owned that as a system.

(00:09:30):
As a different example though, at Ramp we're big enough and we're a B2B company, but we have a B2C top of funnel where we try to acquire users and get them to fill out our application to get a credit card. We have a distinct revenue operations team that's broken into business technology and marketing technology. So, there's lots of flavors of how it can exist. I think that's kind of the interesting and fun part of Marketing Tech is that it's not just one single version of the world that you apply to many companies, there's like a million variations that I've seen and they all kind of look to solve the same problem.

Lenny (00:10:00):
So, to make it even more specific and really simple for people to think about what someone in MarTech does, essentially it's using technology and tools to drive growth. Is that a simple way of thinking about this one specific roles?

Austin Hay (00:10:11):
Totally. That's exactly right. And I have this adage I always say, which is tools are just meant to solve problems. And the problem set for marketing technologists and business technologists is you focus on the tools.

Lenny (00:10:24):
And so when someone currently say listening doesn't have a MarTech person and they're thinking about, hey, is this a gap we have? What is that slice of work that a MarTech person would take if they currently have say a growth team or a growth PM that's leading growth and a growth team around them?

Austin Hay (00:10:40):
This comes up all the time, by the way, I talk to businesses every year that have this problem of we have a growth team, we're growing pretty fast. We have a guy that we hired, usually an engineer who stood up all these tools for us. Or it could be gal too just to be clear, but this person has been here for two years and knows all of our systems really well, but now they're becoming overwhelmed. They don't have enough time. The systems are too complex. This is the flavor of story that I hear so often around startups who have hired a great growth person and managed tools and systems, but at some point they reach that point in time where it's no longer manageable by one person or even a set of people. And that slice of works looks like setting up new tools, building new tools on top of them because a lot of times you'll take a third party tool, call it like a segment or an amplitude, and you'll build tooling in your own stack behind it to power something much more advanced.

(00:11:35):
And everybody thinks that marketing technology is just the third party tools, but actually it's designing, architecting and building that stuff on top of your third party tools. That's how you actually have a lot of velocity is thinking about not just build versus buy. It's build and buy now. So, you buy the tool to get 90% of the way there and then you build the cool thing on top with the other 10%. And so that architecting decision usually falls on this person. The one really unsexy part of it, which I tend to love because it's really high leverage is the contract part. When you start out as a business, you sign any contract you want with a third party because you're just trying to get going. You have much bigger problems, product market fit, staying alive, runway. But at some point as you scale and you're starting to make money, now you start to care more about not just how much money you're making but how much money you're losing usually from contrasting SaaS tools.

(00:12:24):
And so that's where you start to have more scrutiny around what types of deals are we signing, what are the terms? Do we have liability exposure? What's it going to cost us if we actually scale? And it's great that we have this cool rate at 500 MTUs, what happens when we have a million MPUs? So, I worked at mParticle, which was a CDP provider for a long time and I was their VP of growth and part of their SaaS vendor strategy is like, how can we design these cost structures in a way so that at the company scales we make more money? That's just part of the business. And so if you have that mindset of, well, I'm looking out for the business not just now, but two 30 years in the future, that's where you can also have a lot of value from a systems or marketing technologist.

Lenny (00:13:05):
Maybe a sign that you should start thinking about a MarTech person on a growth team is what I'm hearing is you're starting to accumulate all these different tools and maybe there's a sense that you could be a lot more efficient in connecting data and the backend infrastructure for how you think about growth and how you drive growth and measure growth.

Austin Hay (00:13:24):
Yeah, efficiency and pain. I would say pain drives people more. It's like, hey, we can't do something because nobody knows this thing. We can't do something because we don't know the best way to set up these tools or to change these tools or we can't even move forward where a business plan because we're worried that changing our tools might have an impact. And usually this is related to email marketing tools and data tools, so like CDPs and folks like Braze interval and just because a lot of times your email is the thing driving recurring customers to come back to your product and use it. So, you can't actually sometimes make the changes you want without understanding how something was set up in the first place.

Lenny (00:14:03):
You talked about where this person would live in the organization. There's all these different places. I talked about revenue team, maybe the ops team, maybe growth team, marketing team. What's your general advice for who should lead the hiring of this role and also just roughly who should they report to?

Austin Hay (00:14:21):
So, I have not to shamelessly plug my Reforge course in the fall, but I'm going to be shamelessly plug my Reforge course in the fall. We have this awesome matrix that we built that shows where this person should live, what they do, who they should report into, and it's all part of the fall course if you want like the deep dive into it. There's going to be a section on it, but just the gist of it is I first like to break it down into two dimensions. First is a B2C company or B2B company. And then the second dimension is how important is it to you that this person report into a specific function or not? So, first with B2C and really maybe a simpler version of that is centralized versus decentralized. So, we have B2C, B2B, centralized, decentralized. In a B2C organization I think actually thinks it's quite simple.

(00:15:08):
Most of the time your tools, your marketing tools are intended to help the growth team. The growth team has a job to be done, which is to spur user growth and tools are just meant to solve the problem. So, marketing technology's job is to serve the growth team. Now it obviously serves product and analytics and data, but its key stakeholder and customer is the marketing or growth function. And so I think it makes a lot of sense that if you're designing an org under a CMO or a marketing person, you put marketing technology alongside your head of growth or maybe reporting into your head of growth depending on the seniority of the person. And that works quite well. The key thing there is you just want to make sure that this marketing technology person is a really strong technical architect or some type of technical operator because they're going to be your representation to the product in engineering orgs.

(00:15:53):
Now, some people take a little bit of a slight twist on that. They say, hey, I have a product manager who manages growth that comes from the PM side. You could have a platform PM that serves the same thing in MarTech and they're responsible for all internal platform systems. And then you get into questions of does that belong in product ops or not? And I'm not going to go there. But for B2C, that's the centralized function. For B2C decentralized, what you do instead is you just say like, hey, we're going to have one of these systems, people in every org. Product is going to have a product ops person and growth is going to have a growth ops person, engineering will have engineering ops, and then we kind of divide the lines based on what tools they're managing. I generally don't see that working very well just because as you add more operational people, it just creates more systems.

(00:16:39):
And so unless you're a massive company where you need that type of scale, I think most startups should avoid that decentralized model. And then for B2B, I think B2B is really messy because not only do you have pure B2B where you're only selling to enterprises, but you have this concept of B2B2C, which is where you're actually selling to users and to businesses sometimes at the top of the funnel and the bottom, but also sometimes at the same time like notion. Notion sells to users so, they have a little growth acquisition funnel at the top, but then they also sell to businesses. And I find there's really, again, there's two ways decentralized or centralized actually at Ramp we've gone back and forth between the two models. We started centralized with the Rev ops group, we decentralized it and put marketing technology into the CMO org and now we're rolling it back into the revenue operations org Largely has to do with who is our customer?

(00:17:28):
Whose problems are we solving and where are resources allocated? Because if you have a decentralized model, then you run the risk of having to have lots of resources decentralized across the team. And the question is, can that function actually get work done or resources spread too thin and the priorities on align that it makes it challenging to get work done. And yeah, I would just say especially on B2B, for people out there listening, there is no right answer. And I even think that marketing technology could live in product, it could also live in engineering. Some of this has to do with who is the leader of this function. If it blends more towards ops, meaning managing processes and systems, then yeah, maybe you want to decentralize it and keep it in its representative function. If you have a really technical leader who was an architect or a PM that might indicate where that person should actually be leading their team. So, it's very case specific, which I know is a terrible answer, but it's the way it is.

Lenny (00:18:25):
Makes total sense. If someone were to hire someone like in Austin, are you doing the work yourself? Are you an IC for quite a while or do you end up building a team, say engineers that are building some of this infrastructure, how does that usually play out?

Austin Hay (00:18:38):
I think all marketing technologists at some level are ICs. I think it's a great job personally, because I get to be an IC and a manager. You have to be an IC in that, you are the most senior technical expert on all first party and third party systems. So, you have to know really well how third party tools work and you don't know that without doing the work yourself. So, I do find that some of the best marketing technologists have at least at some point in the last five years, been an operator and expert managing tools and systems. And then usually the teams are small and super cross-functional.

(00:19:10):
So, what I would say is more important to look for than how many people has this person managed is how well can they manage upward, laterally and downward because they're going to have to go talk to the head of rev ops if they want to change something in Salesforce, they're going to have to talk to the VP of product if they want to make a big platform change that touches something else. They're going to be relying constantly on data resources from their head of data. So, I think that this person, the secret sauce is more of how good of a cross-functional team player are they. I almost view them like a true quarterback every [inaudible 00:19:41] says people are quarterbacks. But really marketing technology because it lives between so many departments, it plays that role of having to call plays and pull on different departments.

Lenny (00:19:50):
And because it sounds like you don't have a team to do some of these things and you need to convince people to help you out.

Austin Hay (00:19:56):
Totally. Yeah. It's a game of persuasion and salesmanship. You have to convince people why the problems are big and especially as you get bigger, a lot of the decisions or problems of marketing technology are not about rapidly making a huge transformation. It's slow transformation that can have big implications. I'll just give you one example. Like lots of big companies I talked to have two CDPs or two attribution tools and it's like there's the cost problem. How do we get rid of this secondary tool to reduce the cost? Maybe it's a million dollars, but there's also the complexity and decision-making problem. How do we make people move and work faster by not having the complexity of asking, which tool do I use in such a simple decision?

(00:20:39):
And then you get to a really big scale at Walmart where your problem isn't even. How do we consolidate the stack and make it so tools that are helpful for people, but how do we prevent from getting back to that state? How do we put safeguards in place to make sure people actually have access to the tools that they want and can solve their problems? But we're not introducing duplicative tech into our organization because a really well-known, sorry to put SaaS vendors on the spot here, but well-known SaaS vendor plays the land and expand motion. You get in small and then you grow your business. Well, that's a distinct problem for businesses that are trying to control costs and simplify the way the world works.

Lenny (00:21:15):
I want to talk about tools that you recommend and use most often, but I'm thinking maybe we start with a different question, which is around just what does your day look like as a MarTech person? What are you doing day to day and from the lens of your growth PM listening or a leader listening and what could this person do for me and how much leverage can I get if I were to find a MarTech person?

Austin Hay (00:21:37):
There's half of marketing technology, which I would call somewhat administrative and high leverage. It's managing PI requests and PI technology, managing administrative stuff like contracts and admittance to tools and permissions. This is all at a big company scale. You probably don't do this when you're a small company, but that stuff matters because give you an example, you give edit access to somebody who wants HubSpot and they send a fake email test to a million people and now you're on Twitter being embarrassed as a company. It's like-

Lenny (00:22:12):
Does that happen to you?

Austin Hay (00:22:13):
It hasn't happen to me. But I've gotten the emails from certain companies where it's like, this is a test and it came from an intern.

Lenny (00:22:20):
Yeah, same.

Austin Hay (00:22:20):
You're like, that's just permissioning gone wrong. So, I think a big part of the role is designing systems that are automated to handle that stuff because ideally you don't want to be sitting around in your computer all day clicking one conductor request to approve permissions. You should look at the role, look at the experience of tenure and department and make a decision about which accesses you get. So, automating that is a big part of my job. The manual part of my job, which I feel like is actually really fun, is again the designing systems and contracts for the future. So, it's about how do we design a system and create a vision and persuade people about what our system technology can look like over the course of one to two years, the time span that I usually look at. And then how do you change state from then to now? Some of that has to bring in financials and contracts. That's where this plays a role. What are our contract terms today? What's the price we're paying? What is our growth going to be?

(00:23:12):
Can we build a financial model to show how much it's going to cost us both in terms of operational efficiency and actual real fixed and variable costs to end up in that state? And then how do I create a graceful argument to persuade people that we should spend engineering time and resources? And usually it nets out pretty clear. It's like if it's less than a certain amount, how do you justify spending any engineering time on it? You have to wait for the problem to become big enough. But then back to your other point around how do I give growth managers out there something useful. I would say the big thing that people forget in an early stage of a company's lifetime is that the company will outlast you, hopefully. You will not be the last growth manager unless the company fails. So, I tend to take a little bit of a different approach than most, which is like I think you should always be thinking about the future.

(00:24:02):
That doesn't necessarily mean you should make design choices that over index towards the future so much that you miss product market fit or you make poor product decisions. But when you set up tools and you pick tools and you implement them, you should be thinking, what's going to happen a year from now if I don't change anything? And is this going to be a catastrophic situation or not? And then try to take actions to mitigate that risk. Some examples are like if it's $2,000 to get SSO and two days to set it up and that prevents you from having a security problem where somebody downloads all your users, it seems like a great investment.

(00:24:37):
And guess what? Over time, if you don't do that, you're going to eventually have to hire an IT person to go and set up SSF for all your tools. So, some of this is more of just being a good steward about managing first and third party tools with an eye towards the future. It's always a trade-off, right? Because the more time you spend when you're building product early in a company's lifetime, that time could be spent on other things. So, if you waste it managing third party tools or setting up correctly, then maybe you miss out on a key product feature. So, I think it is a tough balance to strike.

Lenny (00:25:06):
Coming back to the different kind of roles within the growth umbrella, if someone has someone leading paid growth let's say, and they're just like a paid growth person, do you also find a MarTech person to work alongside this person? How connected would you be to someone that's just responsible for paid growth?

Austin Hay (00:25:24):
Maybe a key differentiator too. We didn't talk about this in the beginning, but there's marketing technology and marketing operations. So, in my mind, this is just my own kind of mental framework is marketing technology has tech in it. So, it's usually an engineer or somebody with an engineering background doing that function. Marketing operations is usually not always technical. Maybe a systems analyst or business analyst could be somebody really, really smart, but they may not have an engineering background. So, I think that's a key distinction too. And you typically see that in B2B where you'll have mar ops function, which is setting up campaigns, sending email blasts, debugging, doing analytics work, SQL queries, all semi-technical work but not engineering based. So, in my mind when we talk about marketing technology, I'm really thinking it as an engineering based role and even by background, I'm not a software engineer, but I was a civil engineer and I learned how to program and I went through a bunch of coding to get there.

(00:26:21):
So, that's my way into the engineering world. And you typically find that a lot with marketing technologists in particular is they either are software engineers or they've gotten enough experience to moonlight as software engineers. And so we get to this problem set of a user acquisition person. How would they rely on a marketing technologist? Well, I think the most superhuman user acquisition people out there are engineers and they don't need a marketing technologist because they set up the tool themself. They know how the paid campaign runs and they just do it all. And you'll typically find these super humans at small startups where the engineer is just told by the co-founder, hey, go figure out how Facebook ads work. And superhuman is born. More often though that doesn't happen. Or those people once they do it once, they never want to do it again. So, you'll typically find the role split and that's the natural thing that happens.

(00:27:13):
As you scale, you divide responsibility and you'll see you'll have the person who's responsible for bidding and acquiring users and paying down those campaign costs. Then you have the person who's in charge of how does it all work? How do we get this thing to actually run? And that's very similar to what we have at Ramp. We have an amazing user acquisition team. I know Sri Batchu was on here a while back. He hired a guy named Cody Morgan at Ramp who has a user acquisition team. And the way to think of it is, my job is to help support them in running all their campaign needs and when they have a directive from the CEO that says we need to improve CAC or change any of our metrics, it's my job to partner with them to help them do that. And actually one of the coolest and most fun projects that we worked on early when I joined Ramped is we were optimizing.

(00:27:55):
We're trying to get top of funnel data all the way down to the bottom of the funnel and tie it with opportunity data so we could send that back to the ad network so that rather than optimizing your campaign off of when a user clicks a button on the website, you're actually optimizing it off of did the opportunity occur and what was the kind of ideal value for that opportunity? And you're sending that data as a synthetic event back to Facebook and all those guys. So, it can be really cool and super advanced stuff depending how deep on the funnel you get and how complex your business is.

Lenny (00:28:25):
So, you're generally not running campaigns of your own unsafe Facebook or AdWords. You're mostly as a MarTech person supporting people who are doing that.

Austin Hay (00:28:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:28:35):
Awesome.

Austin Hay (00:28:35):
Helping them use tools and technologies to do it.

Lenny (00:28:38):
Great. Do people give you goals? Are you responsible for growth goals of your own? And in general, are MarTech people, should they have goals and growth goals on their plate or are they just there to support people who do?

Austin Hay (00:28:52):
Oh, that's a great question and I would like, maybe this is at the end of the podcast, we ask people about this because I would love to know what is a better version of goaling? So, there's two ways that I've thought of it. One is my goals are directly tied to the people I'm serving. So, if user acquisition has, I mean we do, we have a growth goal and we have a CAC goal at Ramp. So, my goals are tied to them, so I'm going to help make sure that that is achieved, but then there's also a cost and efficiency goal that I internally think is valuable. Whether or not the business thinks it is valuable, it doesn't really matter. I come from a sales background and I like to run lean and efficient teams, and so I'm always thinking to myself, how much were the tools when I came in, how much are they now?

(00:29:34):
Have I set us up for success so that as we grow, our cost per user or cost per seat comes down and how much more efficient are we because of that? The ideal world is that you actually are growing as a business making more money, hiring more people, acquiring more users, and your total cost of tooling per person goes down. That's like the dream. And there's lots of ways you can build that financial model, but I mean that's what I think most marketing technology leaders should strive for is to make sure that they're controlling costs over time because most businesses don't. There can be some goals that are discreet in nature that are not cost-efficient, but more like net capability related. So, it's like, hey, we want to design a first party system that's world-class that achieves these three goals, right? Maybe you want to incorporate artificial intelligence into some part of our product platform and incorporate third party tools.

(00:30:25):
And those are more like discrete product goals. In the same way that a business might launch an external product goal to launch a feature, they sometimes also might have internal product goals, clean up our revenue operations systems, make our email marketing system better. In particular, email marketing is one I see come often a lot with small businesses and even medium-sized businesses where they'll have picked a tool at the start of the company's lifecycle and as the company has grown, they've outgrown that tool. They need to move to a Braze or Marketo. And so there'll be a big six-month initiative to say, we just got to switch. That's the goal. We have to safely get off this small tool to a much bigger, more complex tool that's going to cost us more. It's a lot more complex, but we need to do it without losing money. That's usually the job of a MarTech person in some type of change transformation effort.

Lenny (00:31:14):
Perfect segue to where I wanted to go, which is tooling and your recommendations and favorite tools. And so maybe we start with just what do you find as a good starting tool stack for people starting to think about MarTech and basically growth, and then what does it end up being generally?

Austin Hay (00:31:32):
In terms of stack, again, we think about B2B and B2C. B2C I would say the stack was largely solved from 2017 to 2020. We've had like a renaissance of the data architecture, so what I'm going to do is I'm dig through B2C then and now and then we can go B2B then and now.

Lenny (00:31:52):
Great.

Austin Hay (00:31:52):
Okay. So, B2C, if you back up to 2016, 2017, you have segment and the rise of the CDP. Consumer based businesses have to collect a user and tie a bunch of data to them and then track their actions to send it out to performance ad networks and email marketing tools and product analytics tools. And so you would see this very commoditized stack. It would be like CDP in the middle bunch of tools connected. The promise of the CDP was you integrate one SDK, your engineers don't hate you send all the data to the other tools you can create audiences.

(00:32:26):
Great. Lasted for a long time. The thing about it though that I think really changed around 2020 is that the cost of ownership of warehousing became much cheaper. And so 2021, you start getting to the place where it actually makes a lot of sense and is really easy to store all your data in a warehouse model all your data in the warehouse, and to do it without needing a vast data team. I would say Airbnb was probably doing all this well before anybody else was, but they had the main advantage of a lot of money and a lot of resources. So, now come 2020, it's cost-efficient to have a data team with your own warehouse and to manage data centrally in something like Snowflake. So, now this question is like, okay, well we got to get data into the warehouse, but how do we move data around is totally different.

(00:33:11):
And that's what really led to the rise of reverse ETLs. So, now you can actually build your own CDP and lots of businesses already have, I'm consulting with a well known financial trading platform a couple of months back, and they have a CDP, they have all this internal data in their warehouse, but they have not been able to activate it because it's pretty old architecture. Everything's batch based end of the day. What they need is a reverse ETL. They don't need to take that data and just get it out into the world. So, they need the reverse ETL component or the transformation component of a CDP. And so I'd say now today when we think about B2C businesses, you can either go to the traditional route, buy CDP, hook up all your tools, third party.

(00:33:52):
I think that's a great move if you do not have a lot of engineering resources because you're not spending a ton of time and energy on a warehouse and all the modeling that comes with it, you're just spending time to implement one SDK. I think if simplicity is the name of the game for your business, CDP, Centralized Stack, great move. If you are an advanced engineering culture and you are cutting edge and you're going to do a bunch of modeling in DBT and you already have Snowflake, you should move towards a model of using a reverse ETL. What it means is that there's a way to get your data into the warehouse and then how you activate it is completely independent from the CDP. And so what that means is actually you can have lots of different variations of the stack.

(00:34:31):
You could use Amplitude as your CDP, collect all your data, stream it into Snowflake. They actually now have an integration with Snowflake that lets you feed data directly out of Snowflake, and then you could use a reverse ETL to just pipe that data wherever you want. There's a really good section though, again, sorry to self aggrandize, but there's a really good section in the Reforge module this fall that talks about what happens when you have multiple ways to move data. You buy amplitude for your CDP and you're moving data to your warehouse. Amplitude is a bunch of integrations, but you also have reverse ETL and you can move data out of your warehouse.

(00:35:05):
Where do you choose? And I would say a lot of businesses get in trouble when they don't have a methodology or a system for how and when to move data from one place to the other, so they just do it haphazardly, right? And the key in systems management is you want to design a process for doing it some type of waterfall or mental model for when it makes sense to move data directly from Amplitude, which is the ingestion point of your data stream or from the warehouse where you can model it and make it better. I think the key is just having a philosophy and approach. There's not really one answer, but that's all B2C. So, B2B I would say ... Yeah, go ahead.

Lenny (00:35:40):
Before we move on to that one, you mentioned reverse ETLs. What are some examples of products that are reverse ETLs so that people can look them up?

Austin Hay (00:35:47):
Yeah, I personally think the reverse ETL is a capability. It's the ability to move data from a warehouse to a tool. So, technically speaking, you'll find reverse ETLs in CDPs and as standalone products. Segment has a reverse ETL function they just launched, and Particle has a reverse ETL function they just launched. Rudder Stack, which is a CDP has always had a reverse ETL function where you can take warehouse data and move it to different cloud infrastructure. Then there are distinct standalone products. Census, which was back Bay 16Z and Hightouch are the two standalone reverse ETLs. And like I said, I'm an investor in Hightouch, love their work, we use them at Ramp. At the end of the day, you should pick tools because they help solve problems, not because of anything else. So, we can come back to that if you want.

Lenny (00:36:32):
Wonderful. Great, great. Yeah, that was perfect. Keep going.

Austin Hay (00:36:35):
Okay. Yeah, so we talked about B2B, or sorry, B2C. B2B, I probably don't have as much history as say people who survived the dot-com crash in 2008. I started really my career in B2B in 2014, so I'll share a little bit of my experience and I'm just hopefully just saying this because listeners may chime in and be like, oh man, this guy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, which is totally fair game. So, 2014 though, I remember working at Branch, I was working for our COO Mike Molinet, who's now at this really cool company called Thena, but at the time I was working for Mike, and as we talked about before, oftentimes growth stacks just appear because you're given a challenge. And I remember sitting in this tiny room with Mike. We were over in Palo Alto, right off the fills in Palo Alto in this tiny room.

(00:37:27):
It was boiling in the room like so hot we were sweating and we were mapping out on a whiteboard how we would design our first version of our system, like how we capture leads, how we get them into Salesforce, how we would email them with a little tool called Outreach at the time, that was still a startup. And I'll send it to you after this if you want to show them to viewers, but it's so MVP, but it still models what a lot of people have today. There's some ingestion point for your data. There's Salesforce, there's some type of outbounding tool, there's an enrichment tool, and then a lot of other Jerry rig stuff hooked up to Salesforce. And for the most part, that's how B2B still exists today as you have Salesforce and then the whole world and the universe revolves around Salesforce. You just have more advanced tools, you have Gom and stuff like that.

(00:38:12):
I think the big change though, and what is really fascinating and has been fun to watch is in the last two, three years, you now have this whole rise of B2B2C, which takes all the complexity of the top of funnel user acquisition system and stuffs it right alongside your CRM and how you build an elegant system there in that space, I think is one of the most complicated and intricate pieces of being a MarTech person today. And some of it just has to do with the data language. Like all these B2C tools were designed with two objects, a user and an event. And so if you're not a technologist, it's like object orientation is how you kind of think about the world. There's only two concepts for the world in a user acquisition based system. A user who's a person either anonymous or known coming into your website and the things that they do on your website or application, and you use all that data to acquire them or model them.

(00:39:03):
In a B2B business you have all that complexity, but at the end of the day, you might not really need it if all the person is doing is it's just the company is signing the contract and then you don't really care what happens afterwards. You might track users and events inside your application, but it's not for the acquisition, it's for the retention of the user. B2B2C is fascinating because you have all the complexity at the top, but then how and when do you tie a user to a company or some type of entity object, and what tools do you need to do that and where do they live in the system? And do those tools actually have competing priorities? Let me give you the greatest example of this that happened at Notion when I was consulting to them at Chris when I was consulting to them and at Ramp is having both HubSpot and Salesforce.

(00:39:45):
Both are CRMs, both have the ability to track users and companies, neither are CDPs. And how you actually map the data from HubSpot to Salesforce kind of determines how much hell you're in, and there's really no good solution. It's just like you have to figure out for yourself, how do you want to acquire use at the top of the funnel? How do you merge them into the bottom of the funnel of the Salesforce? And again, there are lots of options or versions of the world. You could use Amplitude only and collect all your user and event data and then merge that into Salesforce directly. You could collect all your data in Amplitude or Segment and then post that to HubSpot, which then posts that to Salesforce. But of course, as you make these decisions, your systems becomes more complicated and more than one person can manage. So, there's this trade-off between complexity and resources that you always have to juggle.

Lenny (00:40:33):
Today's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you're using the same data sets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser. If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google.

(00:41:23):
It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny. There's this big question within B2B and B2C around how to do attribution. Well, it's a never ending struggle. I'm curious if you have any pro-tips or best practices or tools that you use to improve the way attribution happens at a company.

Austin Hay (00:42:09):
Actually, I listened to your pod on multi-touch attribution. I'm forgetting who you were with at this point, but it was like I was loving it because it talked about MMM and MTA specifically.

Lenny (00:42:19):
Yeah, that was a newsletter post actually, not even a podcast.

Austin Hay (00:42:22):
Yes. So, back to our conversation around division of responsibility. I'm not always the person you should talk to create an MMM model. I'm not a data scientist. I know how to make MMM models and I know what they are.

Lenny (00:42:36):
Can you explain MMM briefly?

Austin Hay (00:42:38):
Mixed Media Modeling. And MTA stands for Multi-touch Attribution and it's these two ways of measuring the world and marketing to understand how you should allocate resources to campaign spend. MTA and MMM though are both underpinned by how you collect data. They're both informed by the user object and the event objects that you collect on your website or your application that then lead to the data that data scientists use for MTA and MMM. That's the connection between data and MarTech is often the tools and systems that we build and stand up and manage are what are used for these very complicated growth, experimentation and attribution results at the end of it. And one of the most discreet things you can do for MTA, because I get this question all the time around, hey, do we need MTA?

(00:43:21):
What should I do first touch or last touch? Should I do both? And there's actually really, I can send you this guide, but there's six or seven things you can do to basically futureproof yourself from needing either one. Because most businesses either start with first touch or last touch and then eventually want to move to a multi-touch attribution model. And for those who don't know what that is, first touch is where you kind of collect the data about where somebody first came from. Last touch is where you collect the data about where the person last came from. So, an example, would this be like if I went to Lenny's Newsletter from a Google ad and that's all he has? That would be my first touch and my last touch. If I first came from a Google ad to Lenny's Podcast, but then later I came from a Facebook ad or I don't know direct, then that would be my last touch.

(00:44:06):
And so it's this question of does the Google original first Google Channel get credit or does the second one the Facebook or direct get credit? And the first touch attribution model, a hundred percent goes to the first channel and the last touch attribution model, a hundred percent credit goes to the last touch. And a mixed attribution model or multi-touch attribution model, you're trying to figure out how to split the difference. And usually the evolution for businesses is they start with first touch or last touch, then they go to splitting it literally 50/50. And then somebody gets angry because they're not getting enough credit and they say, we've got to go to MTA. And there are both first party solutions for that and third party solutions for MTA. But back to the main thing, the main point is if you think about what you're collecting, this is for website businesses, you're collecting the referrer, like in the URL where the person's coming from, and you need any UTMs associated with that person.

(00:44:58):
And you also need any parameters from the advertising networks that might give them the ability to counter a conversion. Every ad network out there has little things they stuff into your URL that tell you that you came from them. Facebook has FVP, FPID, they sometimes encode it. Google has this thing called Google Click ID, which is just a really long string of characters that don't matter unless you know how to decode it. But all advertisers, and for the longest time advertising worked by putting parameters in URLs, pushing somebody through to your website, collecting those parameters and then passing it back to the ad network so they could get credit for it. And so in my mind, the best practice that everybody should stand up from day one is to basically design the system for MTA and then use whatever makes sense as you grow.

(00:45:45):
And so the way that I typically recommend to people is like imagine when a user comes to your website, you collect the URL, collect the referring URL, collect all the additional marketing parameters that you might want, [inaudible 00:45:57], TikTok ID, Microsoft ID, you should just make a list of them. And if you don't have that list, I can give them to you. And then you should collect all UTMs. So, in the URL, you're going to have UTM campaign, UTM medium. Most marketers use this to note what the campaign type was. Now the thing is that UTM is only going to be specific to the moment in time that the person came to your website. So, back to example about Lenny's podcast. If I come to LE's podcast and I came from a Google ad, then my UTM is only for that Google ad.

(00:46:28):
So, I have a Google Click ID and I have a UTM. So, what you're got to do is you've got to store those parameters locally on the device. Either was a browser or whatever. You got to store it as UTM first campaign, UTM last campaign. And what you do is every single time that a person comes, you replace the last campaign or the last value with the one that's there. So, say the last one was Facebook and then I come later from a direct mailer ad you replace the UTM last medium with the new one. Now what's happening if you're using third party tools is that you're collecting this user information when the person's on the website, you're going to collect it both as a user attribute and as an event that way. What's going to happen on the backend for your data warehouse team is they're going to see a user profile that has both the first attribution information and the last attribution information.

(00:47:20):
And then for all the stuff in the middle, you're firing off a page view event with first and last, where the last might deviate if there were multiple steps in the middle. So, what they can do is they can just coalesce over all the last UTMs they've seen on all your events by user to get both their first one, all the ones in the middle and the last. And so this isn't actually that complicated to set up. Most people just don't do the work early on. And then when they want to go back later and have MTA results, they don't have the data to do it. So, one of the things I tell people who are debating this is let's just get the infrastructure right from the beginning.

(00:47:55):
Let's set up so that you have users, you have user attributes, you're collecting first and last UTM on users. You're firing events with all those. There's some other more complex things you can do too. You can set them in first party cookies and you can also set them in your third party cookies for your tooling vendors. At the end of the day though, what matters is you just are collecting this information from the beginning. That way when you actually want to progress your attribution model, you don't have to wait a really long time to start gathering that data.

Lenny (00:48:24):
Amazing. I love the details that you're sharing. I don't know where else people can find this sort of advice. It sounds like a core part of this is one, just having a data warehouse where you just throw all this data into, and two, having a taxonomy that you can rely on and do multiple things with down the road. Is that roughly right?

Austin Hay (00:48:42):
Yeah, I think that's right. The taxonomy though, I think what's interesting is it's very much guided by your third party tools. And again, that's the reason why I think companies often miss the mark here is because they're not thinking about what can my tool actually allow me to put into it in the first place.

Lenny (00:48:59):
Just to make sure I understand what you're saying there, you're saying generally maybe third party tools limit what you can do, which set you up for hardship later. And maybe what you're saying is do that yourself, that tracking piece, is that roughly what you're saying?

Austin Hay (00:49:14):
Yeah, I think that's right. The way to think of it is if you build your own data warehouse, your schema is unlimited. You can do whatever you want. You can design product schema, you can design user schema and event schema, but most third party B2C tools don't allow you to control the schema. There's only one CDP I know that does that, that's Snowplow. The rest are there's a user object and an event object. So, you can either stuff data as a user property onto the user object or you can stuff data into the event and fire it off as an event, but that's what you're working with. So, what I'm saying is most people just don't think about the object orientation of the third party tools they think about and they don't design their website traffic or their app traffic. We didn't talk about app, which is a whole different slew because doing attribution with Iowas 14 is much more difficult.

(00:50:07):
But even in the website version of the world, people will often just collect UTMs and think that their job is done and it's like actually it's more complex. You have to think about first and last, think about the steps in the middle, design it so that you're putting it on the user profile and in the event. And so this goes back to the main thing that we were talking about earlier, whereas the job of a marketing technologist is to think often one to two years down the road about what we're going to need to solve for and design systems in an elegant way, not to break the bank, but to at least be the minimum viable product to actually get there. And a lot of my job, and I think the job of marketing technologists is trying to preserve that future state in the most minimally invasive engineering and resource way possible.

Lenny (00:50:48):
You've talked a bit about thinking ahead and a bunch of tools and platforms, and I'm wondering are there any new and emerging tools, platforms or even growth channels that you're keeping an eye on or excited about or finding more and more useful?

Austin Hay (00:51:02):
I'd be remiss if we didn't talk about Threads, right? Threads is super interesting. The question will be how quickly can they stand up an API for advertising and what does that look like or do they just blind it in with the existing meta and Facebook architecture? One of the caveats that I'm sure a lot of performance marketers out there will agree with is Facebook has a conflict of interest in reporting, right? They want you to spend money, so obviously they want to report the best results. And that's the reason why attribution parties like Branch and AppsFlyer exist is to somewhat curtail that conflict of interest. And so I'll be really interested just to see how attribution works, especially when you're moving from Instagram to Threads, from Facebook to Threads. Will it be the same architecture, will be the same advertising platform? Will they try to do something new?

(00:51:52):
So, I'm keeping my eyes on that. Reddit is also a very interesting place to convert now. They're opening up their conversions API, and I'm seeing a lot more investment in Reddit just because you can have embedded ads now that almost look like they can be posts that you can comment on. I think it just speaks to the maturity of the advertising business. What's happening in the background of all this is ad attribution from apps has become a lot more difficult and mostly aggregate. From 2010 to 2020, we had the golden years of deterministic matching where it was very easy to run an ad and understand with precision who installed the app. Maybe you didn't know their name, but you actually would know their IDFA and you could tie that to their PI. You can't do that anymore. It's very challenging.

(00:52:35):
Even when you can do it, the results that you would get are pretty low because nobody's going to be opting into giving you their IDFA. So, what that means is these ad networks are becoming more complex, sophisticated, and interesting right at the same time that it's harder for marketers to really understand how they're spending money. And so I'm paying a lot of attention to how marketers make decisions with probabilistic data because most of the work that I'm doing now is actually saying, well, given that we don't have determinist data about a certain audience or where somebody came from, how can I find other information that will create a model for 30% of the population and we can use that to extrapolate to a hundred. So, probabilistic matching and probabilistic attribution I feel like is a skillset that more marketing technologists and marketers should just get familiar with the way that we make decisions today.

Lenny (00:53:27):
Wow, I hadn't heard of this concept before. And that's how people are starting, or at least you're suggesting that's how people should start thinking about growth results and impact is less, here's how much this ad drove, the likelihood that this ad did this had this sort of impact.

Austin Hay (00:53:46):
And it's not the case with all channels, but it's specific for apps that have mobile apps, they're going to be impacted by it because they just aren't going to be able to discreetly identify one-to-one the person that came from a campaign. They'll know that a group of people came from a campaign, but they won't be able to make measurement with those people alongside other attributes. For website, it's not the same, but there are lots of things that are making it more challenging. One is browsers now are stripping out those URLs we talked about. So, you're just seeing a bigger and bigger percentage of people being counted as organic that actually came from a paid advertisement because when they got redirected to your website, the browser truncated all those URL parameters. The second thing is cookie blockers. We talk about all these third parties before.

(00:54:30):
The way that third parties often collect information is they drop a cookie in your browser that tracks you, if you've heard of Segment, which is one of the most well-known CDPs of the last few years, is they implant a little third party cookie on the site that contains an anonymous user ID and all of your attributes as you're navigating the site. And then once you log in, they convert that to a known or non-anonymous user ID.

(00:54:53):
Usually that's tied to some type of entity ID or a user record. And at that moment in time, if you come back and they see your cookie, they kind of know who you are. Now, if you're blocking cookies, that means you're basically remaining anonymous throughout the entire user journey until you log in. Not to mention a lot of people have lead funnels where you need that information to actually understand what the user is doing before they convert. So, if you're blocking third party cookies before they even get a chance to convert, you have no information about where the person came from. You just saw that they signed up, and so it might as well be organic.

Lenny (00:55:26):
So, you talked about how many people are trying to get used to this new world of ATT and much harder to measure attribution and all that. Is there anything you've learned that has worked well to help you recover from that a little bit in terms of measuring what's happening? Is there any tips you can share or anything you've seen work?

Austin Hay (00:55:44):
Yeah, I mean I think a lot of people are just gravitating towards MMM now without really understanding when MMM is useful or not. I don't know if there's a company called Recast. I think you're an investor. Am I crazy?

Lenny (00:55:57):
I am. And that's who wrote that article that you mentioned actually.

Austin Hay (00:56:01):
That's right. It's Michael and it was somebody else, I can't remember the name besides-

Lenny (00:56:04):
It was another Mike Taylor.

Austin Hay (00:56:06):
I'm not an expert on MMM, so I'm not going to be able to comment to quite the degree that they have. But when I spoke with Michael, and when I think about MMM, a lot of my conversation is this actually really realistic for our business right now? Do we have the data to run an MMM model and how is it going to change or chart the course of our performance ad marketing business in light of having this information? And when I think about it through those lens, most of the time businesses are not ready for MMM. They actually just be an MTA and they need better probabilistic modeling. And I know that's not a super spicy take, but I'd just say at least at Ramp and what I'm seeing at other businesses right now that are operating, it's much more of like we're going back to the days where we understand in broad strokes how much each of our campaigns is driving in advertising revenue.

(00:57:00):
We're not able to tie that discreetly with the user journey. And we know that some percentage of this user base might have been lost or organic. So, in light of those, how do we make spend? And then also you can be pretty smart. You can do, for example, geo-based testing on billboards. Try to isolate that as a factor if you withhold all other confounding factors so you can be smart. Coordinating these types of campaigns though is really challenging, especially if you're a really big business, let's say runs online advertising throughout the US and you're trying to do targeted billboard tests in an isolated number of cities across the states coordinating to turn off demographics, make sure there's not isolating factors. It can be really challenging. So, there's not a silver bullet right now I don't think.

Lenny (00:57:42):
Awesome. Just a few more questions and then a broader question I want to ask. So, say you want to start hiring the next Austin, first of all, what do you look for in the person? What are signs that they're probably going to be worth chatting with? And then what are some interview questions you'd like to ask to get a sense of how strong they are?

Austin Hay (00:58:02):
So, the first thing that I always gravitate towards is just intellectual curiosity. And I know that's very, maybe a little bit overrated, but I think you can tell pretty quickly if somebody's just interested in the world and learning things. And the thing about third party tools is you are constantly learning. You'll never be an expert in everything because there's way too many tools to be an expert on, I forgot what publication, I think it's MarTech editor in chief or something. There's a publication that I subscribed to and everything is classified as MarTech and the diagram is huge, like cover a wall. Now I don't believe everything like that is MarTech, but even if a fraction is, there are way too many tools in technology to ever be an expert. So, you have to be both very interested in learning and very willing to quickly learn if you want to be in the space.

(00:58:50):
And so I generally look for intellectual curiosity as the first sign. The second thing that I think helps people a lot who have intellectual curiosity is they're scrappy in engineering. They might not be the best engineer possible, but they know how to get around. They know JavaScript, they know Python, they can read API documentation and make an API request. They have enough base knowledge to basically understand how to solve a problem that an engineer might do even if they themselves are not an engineer. Now obviously you can get lucky sometimes and you'll find the engineer who never wants to be an engineer again and decides to move into something less technical. And in those cases they're super powerful, but I haven't met a lot of those people in my life. And also there's just some business dynamics to it. You could probably make more as a backend engineer than as a MarTech guy.

(00:59:41):
So, you probably just pursue the pathway that makes more money. It's like a little bit of a utility function. So, I look for intellectual curiosity. I look for basic engineering scrappiness. And as a side note, I would say lots of people out there, the advice that I give them is you don't have to go get a software engineering degree. You can teach yourself, I am self-taught. You can take a coding academy online. I think you get enough knowledge through being able to do web programming or some type of backend programming. So, I would say it's not more than a six-month investment for anybody to really get the skillset that's needed. Obviously once you get the skillset, you can build upon it with years of experience afterwards. But if you're new to the space and you're in marketing ops and you want to get more technical, or if you're a user acquisition manager who did paid performance, but you're like, I really want do things end to end.

(01:00:33):
You can just go pick up some software skills and you probably are going to be pretty dangerous from that. And so those are the two things I gravitate towards. There's obviously many more, but those are the first two. The questions that I like to ask is what does I like to ask people how they prepared for the interview. This is not, I can't take credit for this. My wife told me about, gave me this idea and I loved it. I think it was a16z partner. But I love the question because when you ask, hey, how did you prepare? You're really asking how does the person think? How did they plan? How did they take things seriously or not? What did they read? What did they do? And if you have to prompt them to tell you all the things they did, then they're just not a systems thinker.

(01:01:17):
But if they're like, hey, actually I read these things, I did this. I woke up, I went for a run. The more interesting complex the answer, the more interesting complex the candidate. And so I love the question because it just gives you a really good understanding of the person on a whole, like right out the gate. And then the other question I like to ask is I like to ask, so you're coming in tomorrow to our marketing tech system and by Friday you have to write up a report on all the things we should change. What do you do? And I like to ask that question because it pretty much signals out people who are biased versus not. People who have tooling biases will immediately just like, we should implement this tool because I used it before and I really like to hire people who are not tool specific, who are more tool agnostic and they think about tools as being things to solve problems as opposed to tools being things that you just solve because you've already solved it one way.

(01:02:12):
This isn't a gripe and it's certainly not intended to slice at PMs, but one of my observations of a lot of PMs is they just pick the tools they've already used before because it's easy and it's a shortcut for them, which I understand, but problems are not always the same. So, tools shouldn't always be the same. So, I like to pick people who think about the problem set and the solution space more and they ask questions about what problems you're trying to solve, which I think is much more of an actual PM mindset of trying to work backward from the problem as opposed to just taking the problem and regurgitating stuff that you already know.

Lenny (01:02:45):
Are there any flags you look for that tell you maybe this person isn't someone you want to be working with?

Austin Hay (01:02:51):
I answer that question on two spectrums. One is if I'm hiring as somebody who's hiring an IC versus I'm getting hired. So, one of the red flags whenever I'm approaching a company to work for them is I'll ask for their company financials and a company that's not willing to divulge their financials to a director level or above person, I don't want to do business with because that means they're hiding something. Or they have a culture where they don't trust the most senior leaders of the organization. Either is a bad choice in my perspective. So, that's one of the questions I always ask when I'm going up for a job, when I'm hiring somebody. Red flags, I feel like one of the false flags not a red flag is more like when there's a gap in somebody's job resume, everybody gravitates towards that and it's often really explainable.

(01:03:39):
A good example is I was hiring somebody once who had a two-year gap in their resume. We didn't end up hiring the person, but they went through all the stages and we didn't hire them, not because of them, but because the job got removed and this person took two years to get a philosophy degree or maybe it was a poetry degree and then also taught himself to program. So, it was a really enriching two years and there were lots of ways that I could see them bringing their past experience and the way that they took time off together to be a really well-rounded candidate.

(01:04:12):
So, I would say I look less for red flags and more for false identifiers on the resume application that may shortcut me towards the decision. Another one is just school people just look at your school where you went to undergrad or grad and they kind of make a decision one way or the other. And I feel like that's also can be a really bad shortcut because there's some amazing founders, for example, who went to school as you maybe had never heard of. Yeah, I know that's not a good way to answer the question, but I don't have a good way of looking for red flags, but I do tend to spend a lot of time on netting out of false flags.

Lenny (01:04:49):
That was a great way to answer the question. I want to move on to something totally different, and this isn't something I've been asking people, but I'm curious if there's something here then maybe if there is, I'll start asking this more regularly. I'm curious if there's just any frameworks that you've found especially useful in your work or even life. Does anything come to mind?

Austin Hay (01:05:07):
One thing that I want to build, so if I ever build this, maybe it'll be a newsletter for you, is just a one-page doc of the most useful life frameworks and they're just the words, and so you obviously have to know them, but I feel like I come across really good frameworks all the time and then I forget them. So, I just want a one pager of Lenny's Life frameworks.

Lenny (01:05:07):
Okay, we're starting this right now.

Austin Hay (01:05:30):
Okay, great.

Lenny (01:05:31):
We'll have number one.

Austin Hay (01:05:31):
All right.

Lenny (01:05:31):
I like this.

Austin Hay (01:05:34):
Okay, so I've already said this and you've promised to put this at the top of the list, so I'm really excited. It's just tools are meant to solve problems and I tell that to every person I hire. I repeat it consistently at Ramp and all of my consulting gigs. And it's not just the words, it's the spirit of it. Tools are really just meant to solve problems. You don't have to buy a tool to solve the problem. You also don't have to buy a specific tool to solve the problem. And I think it embodies so much of what marketing technology is trying to do. It's trying to help people understand their problems and then actually take action on them using tools and technology that are most first party and third party. And most people just focus on the tool part and focus on the buying and integration part.

(01:06:16):
And so I think if you consistently remind yourself that tools are just meant to solve problems, then you really get into a space where you as a systems' person can be an advocate for your marketer or your product people. I think sometimes there is a little bit of a tendency for people to think that people who manage and set up tools are just interested in managing and setting up tools, but really at the end of the day, we're trying to help people actually do stuff. Then there's this PPS framework that I talk about a lot, which is problem, people and system. So, whenever there's a challenge that comes up like at Ramp or in a consulting gig, I like to first say what's the problem? Who are the people involved and what system does it impact? Usually because people just jump straight to the system. They're like, hey, there's this problem, I just need to solve it with the tool. Hey, I'm trying to do X, Y, and Z. Can you just give me admin permission straight to the system?

(01:07:07):
So, if you back up though first you understand the problem like, hey, what is this person trying to solve? What is their discreet issue? A great example is I'm a sales manager and I want to make it so that every time I hire somebody, I don't have to go through this really tough process of onboarding my staff. All right, so that's the problem. Who are the people that involves, does the sales manager need permission from the CRO? Do the sellers need to be trained? Is there some other confounding factor that we're not aware of why we don't want to just automate this thing? Once you have an understanding of the people and the problems that you're trying to solve, then it's really, really easy to design the system to solve that. And so that's my number one framework for technologists in particular is like don't just jump to the system, think backwards, start with the people and the problem and then move to the system solution.

(01:07:52):
And then another one that I've already mentioned too is it's B and B as opposed to BVB. So, build and buy as opposed to build versus buy. People all the time just think the second that you're talking about implementing a tool or procuring a solution, it's, Hey, I want to build this thing or I want to buy this really expensive thing. Build versus buy is a very narrowly constricting decision tree. If it's only build versus buy, then you've already made the decision that you can only do one or the other, which means you're already fighting somebody at your organization. Build and buy means that both of you can win and you can actually create a solution that is not only unique but saves the company time and resources and makes everybody happy. It's more of a consensus driven approach. Whenever I hear in a meeting or a call or some discussion about how we have a tool and it's really expensive and we want to build in herself, I try to just use the build and buy framework to tee people up and say, what about the problem?

(01:08:59):
Can we buy? What about the problem can we build? And where does it make sense to invest our resources and our people accordingly to get the optimal outcome? A great example is a company that I was consulting for was thinking about building their own AB testing tool. And actually we had the same problem at Ramp recently, and they're like, well, we just think we should build ourself. This is core to our technology. We have the engineering resources to do it. And they were evaluating it to build the entire system themselves or buy a third party, I think it was split.io or something like that. And the entire engagement was basically designing a financial model to show them that they could make a lot more money, save money, move faster if they just bought the third party tool at the lowest possible cost and spent all of their resources that they were going to spend building it, building around it and making it their own. And there's lots of, I hate the word synergy, it's just so yucky.

Lenny (01:09:54):
I don't mind it. I think it communicates what you want to communicate, and I feel like people don't say it as often anymore, so maybe it's okay.

Austin Hay (01:10:00):
Yeah, because they're afraid. There are mutual benefits is a better way of saying it, if you build a tool custom to yourself when you've bought a tool because the vendor at that point is committed to you and they want you to be successful, so you often can get accelerated outcomes if you build on top of a third party than if you just build it yourself. A great example is say you buy one of these AB testing tools and you build around it and you're a large customer of them, but you've invested a lot of your own engineering resources to make this solution your own.

(01:10:31):
If they know that and they care about you, they're going to be willing to actually make you happy in the moments where you need a change from them, say some SDK change or a new feature or something like that. A framework that I talk a lot about in my Reforge course is about building a stack. Everybody asks, hey, how do I build my stack? What should I do? What tool should I use? Even you earlier were like, what's the golden stack? Tell me what five tools should I get?

Lenny (01:10:57):
Just tell me.

Austin Hay (01:10:58):
Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you at the very end, I got to hold out. Otherwise, you'll ditch this podcast.

Lenny (01:11:04):
That's right. Yeah. Wait until the end. Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Austin Hay (01:11:14):
The only thing I had wanted to fit in, which I feel like is maybe a framework or maybe just a really good decision-making philosophy is this concept of thinking gray. Have you heard of it before?

Lenny (01:11:26):
No. Go on.

Austin Hay (01:11:27):
Okay. So, Steven B. Sample is a professor at USC. He wrote a book called The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership, really great book. It's one of his principles. There's actually a lot of great principles in the book, but this is the one that I think has stuck with me the most in my career. And the concept of thinking gray is so often in life and in our jobs, we are forced to make decisions very quickly. We have to think black or white about a problem set or a solution, and then decide. One of his tactics is this concept of thinking gray, which is actually to not decide for as long as you possibly can before you have to decide. It's really challenging because it involves this little thing called patience, which I do not have a lot of, most of the time, and I know most people don't as well. But it's particularly really relevant in systems thinking and product because so often we believe that we have to make a decision because our boss is telling us because there's an OPR, because we feel the pain because somebody's complaining to me.

(01:12:30):
But actually in reality, you don't have to make a decision at all. You can just let it sit for a while. And this also applies to, I think, how you move through the world and view people. A lot of times we will meet somebody in a company setting or in a business setting, and we are quick to make decisions about them. We even asked me questions about how I hire people very quickly. We're looking for shortcuts to make decisions about evaluating people. One of the best pieces of advice though about thinking gray is it gives you the grace to not decide about people until you have to decide. So, obviously for an interview decision, you have to decide.

(01:13:05):
You have to decide yes or no. But so often you'll come across people and you'll meet them once or twice. And I feel like there's this tendency in the back of everybody's brain to be like, do I like this person? Do I want to work with them? And the question often is not that it's do you have to even make a decision right now? And by leaving yourself to have space to decide, you actually open up the possibility that in the future you'll make a better decision. So, I think that's a really good lesson for systems, and it's obviously a lesson that you can apply to the rest of your life too.

Lenny (01:13:37):
Austin, that was awesome. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Austin Hay (01:13:43):
I'm so ready, Lenny.

Lenny (01:13:45):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Austin Hay (01:13:49):
So, first book I already mentioned, but say it again. It's The Contrarians Guide to Leadership awesome book. Second book that would be really good is the Art and Adventure of Leadership by a guy name Warren Bennis. And these are more philosophically leadership books. They're less about technical specs on how to run a business. So, you have to be into that.

Lenny (01:14:10):
Favorite recent movie or TV show.

Austin Hay (01:14:12):
I'm currently watching for the first time Suits, which I'd never seen before, which I think is pretty good because the story arc of every Suits episode is that there's a problem. Then they solve the problem and then the problem is solved at the end. So, it's very gratifying for anybody out there who's a high anxiety person who just wants to have this story arc resolved at the end of the episode. But if that's not your jam and you like excitement, also watching Silo, Witcher. For comic relief, there's Our Flag Means Death, which is hilarious. Have you seen that show?

Lenny (01:14:44):
No, not Our Flag Means Death.

Austin Hay (01:14:46):
Now you need to go watch it. It's about black beard and gay pirate captain. So, strongly recommend that. And then for just really dumb comedy, What We Do in the Shadows is hilarious.

Lenny (01:14:59):
What was that? What We Do in the Shadows?

Austin Hay (01:15:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:15:02):
Okay. Wow, a lot of recommendations. Thank you for that. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?

Austin Hay (01:15:09):
So, I talked about what you did to prepare, but the other one that I think is really good because it forces people to get vulnerable is tell me about the most difficult or challenging thing you've overcome in the last year in your life. It doesn't have to be work related, it could be personal. And I think it's a great way to just reset the atmosphere, make people dig a little bit deeper into who they are and be more vulnerable. And I find usually it also helps calm them down because if they shared them one of the most challenging, difficult, and hard parts of their life, then all the other questions just are pretty easy. So, that's one of my favorites.

Lenny (01:15:43):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Austin Hay (01:15:46):
This sounds super dumb. It's called cal.com, and I'll tell you the story first. I've been a big Calendly user for a long time, but Calendly is pretty expensive. If Calendly is listening, you want to give me promo, cool. But it's very expensive. And then I also just found that it is not always graceful at syncing multiple calendars from both businesses and consulting gigs and personal, and I had trouble remembering my Calendly link. I don't know. The interface is like circa 2016. So, really looking for something a little bit more notion like with a Command K interface and just integrations that work. And cal.com has not failed me. It has been awesome. So, if people are looking for new Calendly tools, strongly recommend.

Lenny (01:16:30):
Wow, I never heard of this. What a great domain, cal.com.

Austin Hay (01:16:32):
I know, right. Killer.

Lenny (01:16:34):
What is a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself or share with other people, either in work or in life?

Austin Hay (01:16:42):
I just think a lot about the power of appreciation, and one thing that I've just been thinking a lot about recently is the challenge that people might be facing in their daily lives. I actually was recently listening to another podcast by Adam Fishman, and he had Brian Balfour on. And Adam's basically just interviewing a bunch of dads, which is cool. But the nice thing about being a little bit older in your life being a dad is that you maybe have seen hardship before. And this podcast is great at just exploring the stories of people who I really admire and go through their hardship. And in that it's been a very profound experience, understanding the type of challenges that people have gone through in their lives, people who have lost mothers and fathers early in life, people who have lost children. I myself, my wife and I lost her dad last year.

(01:17:35):
We lost two grandparents to COVID, we lost our dog. So, I think that the way that it ties to appreciation is if you can understand what people are going through and you start to view them a little bit more as a human and understand what's beneath the surface of work, who are they? What do they care about? What are the things that are driving their life forward? It just makes you so much more appreciative for what you have and the good moments when they're actually there. And this doesn't just apply to life. It's also like business too. It makes winning a lot more fun when you know the hell that people have gone through. That's just something I like to talk a lot about with people, especially folks who are younger in their careers who maybe have only seen wins describing what the losses look like so they can picture in their mind and then have some experience when they go through it. It's a big part of my shtick.

Lenny (01:18:23):
What an excellent answer. I am definitely going to keep asking this question. For people who are still listening here is the promised Golden Stack.

Austin Hay (01:18:32):
Okay, so Golden Stack. If I was a B2C business, I'd buy Amplitude for my CDP, I'd buy customer IO and maybe I'd upgrade to Braze in the future. I put everything in Snowflake, I'd buy high touch to reverse ETL, all that data out to my ad networks. For attribution, probably AppsFlyer from a mobile app, if not Branch, but it'd probably be AppsFlyer first. So, that gets you, you got AppsFlyer, Amplitude as your CDP and product analytics, Customer IO for email. Snowflake for your data warehouse, Hightouch for streaming all the data tools. That's like golden stack today if I were implementing it for a B2C business. For B2B, roughly the same, Amplitude. If you need an attribution tool, if it's B2B, actually, if it's a web only business, probably we use Branch because Branch is better for web.

(01:19:23):
So, you have Branch, Amplitude, connect all the data to Salesforce. Hopefully at some point in time somebody builds a better Salesforce. That'll be for our next podcast though, Lenny, can't cover that today. And then reverse ETL is Hightouch. So, very similar except the only difference is what do you do for an email tool? A lot of people use HubSpot. I would try to go away with Customer IO as long as I could and then I'd move to Braze afterwards. So, a big difference is just Braze versus Customer IO for B2B.

Lenny (01:19:49):
Final question for you. I heard that you're a drone pilot and I'm curious, what is the coolest place you've flown your drone or the coolest thing that's happened with your drone?

Austin Hay (01:19:57):
So, this actually gets back to our intellectual curiosity thing. Maybe I just search for weird people when I hire because I just love when people do interesting things that are unrelated to work. And the story is during COVID, I didn't really want to just better myself online through a bunch of educational platforms. I just felt like it would be a little bit soul crushing to sit in front of my computer screen and learn how to do statistics or whatever. So, I was trying to look for things that were interesting, niche, outside of my domain knew nothing about. And the three that I came up with were, I learned to fly a drone. I became a CFP, certified financial planner and I became a notary. And it's just because they seemed really useful things that had nothing to do with my work and would learn about something completely interesting and different.

(01:20:46):
So, those are the three that I chose. The drone stuff, it actually was funny. I started flying here in DC. I live in Virginia, but maybe a mile outside of Washington DC and around DC there's a restricted air zone. And so after I did my FA drone pilot license and I became a certified drone pilot, I really went down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to fly a drone in DC, because I've seen them around, but obviously it's a national security and I'm probably dramatically mutilating the exact experience. But as I went to do this, it was very complicated, archaic, but also funny because it was all online. You have to go file out a form, you get a letter from a local representative who says you're in good standing. So, we found a councilman that I just knew. And then you have to fill out all the stuff.

(01:21:39):
This paperwork, the site looks like it's from 1994. There's an office literally in DC where a person approves you. Then you have to let go and get a police officer to effectively babysit you while you fly this drone. And so I did all that and I got to the point where I was going to get babysat and I called our local police department and I was like, yeah. So, I talked to the office, I just need an officer to come out and meet at this time. And they just laughed me off the phone.

(01:22:04):
They're like, we're not going to send a police officer to watch you fly a drone. And I just thought the thing was really funny because yeah, it makes sense. Why would they waste taxpayer dollars to have me fly a drone? But it was a requirement. So, I ended up not being able to fly this drone in DC. But if anybody's listening and they know how to fly a drone and they want to fly, I would be totally down. I have two drones. I have a Mavic Air 2 and a Skydio Enterprise, which Skydio is a really cool company as well if people are looking for drones.

Lenny (01:22:33):
Okay, so you're saying if people have an awesome drone and they live in Virginia, they should come contact you and fly some drones together?

Austin Hay (01:22:38):
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But just not in DC.

Lenny (01:22:42):
All right. Well, Austin, I think we delivered on the promise of making this extremely nerdy and in the weeds, and I think we've solved a lot of people's problems. I feel a lot of gratitude for you, and I feel like we taught a lot of people about MarTech, which was my goal. So, thank you again for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to ask you more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you other than coming to fly drones with you?

Austin Hay (01:23:05):
So, first find me online LinkedIn. Threads, I actually have Threads. I don't have Twitter, like hot take, I think Twitter ruins people's careers. I've already seen multiple careers ruined by Twitter. Some people just don't know how to shut their mouth. So, I'm not on Twitter, but I am on Threads and I'm trying to figure it out. So, if you want to document Threads, you can. I'm on LinkedIn and then I have my email address on LinkedIn too, and I'm always willing to talk to people.

Lenny (01:23:28):
Amazing. And is there any way listeners can be useful to you?

Austin Hay (01:23:31):
Yes. I have a marketing technology course coming out with Reforge in the fall. If you're a practitioner of MarTech or you're interested in MarTech, would totally love for you to take the course, would love to your feedback in particular. I love to stand on this podcast and act like I know a lot about MarTech, but I'm still learning. And so I think it would be awesome to just get feedback from the community about what was interesting and helpful, what wasn't there, and we can improve upon. And then the other thing is, if you're ever looking for MarTech help and you want to reach out, that's great.

Lenny (01:24:02):
Amazing. Austin, thank you again so much for being here.

Austin Hay (01:24:04):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. It was a pleasure.

Lenny (01:24:07):

# Frameworks for product differentiation, team building, and first principles thinking | Ayo Omojola

## Transcript

Ayo Omojola (00:00):
Cash App, as a team we really cared about what we could do that was different and better than what else existed in-market. Being different is not enough, because it's very easy to build a thing that's different from what exists today, because you just have to look at what exists today and build something else. Being better is not enough, because it's also easy to say, "Hey, I'm going to make this thing better, and just charge you more money for it." It has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user, and for us for a long time it was when someone says, "Hey, why are you betting on Venmo?" I'd be like, "Try and send me a dollar that I can use now," and there was only one app you could do it with.

Lenny (00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ayo Omojola, Ayo co-created and scaled Square's popular Cash Card, alongside the hugely popular Cash App. He's currently chief product officer at Carbon Health, one of the biggest and fastest-growing health tech companies in the world. He's a former founder, he's on the board of Pinwheel, and he's an angel investor in companies like Mercury Bank, Fair, Modern Treasury, and dozens of other startups. In today's episode, we dig into lessons from building and scaling the Cash Card and the Cash App, the importance of differentiation when you're building a consumer product or any sort of product.

(01:17):
How to successfully build a startup within a startup, how to succeed in both fintech and in health tech, plus my favorite part of the conversation, a handful of incredibly insightful and practical principles and philosophies around hiring, team-building, leadership, and going deep on problems. Ayo is such a fascinating human and leader, and I am excited for you to learn from him. With that, I bring you Ayo Omojola, after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Microsoft Clarity, a free, easy-to-use tool that captures how real people are actually using your site. You can watch life session replays to discover where users are breezing through your flow and where they struggle, you can view instant heat maps to see what parts of your page users are engaging with and what content they're ignoring.

(02:01):
You can also pinpoint what's bothering your users with really cool frustration metrics, like rage clicks, and dead clicks, and much more. If you listen to this podcast, you know how often we talk about the importance of knowing your users, and by seeing how users truly experience your product you can identify product opportunities, version wins, and find big gaps between how you imagine people using your product, and how they actually use it. Microsoft Clarity makes it all possible with a simple, yet incredibly powerful set of features. You'll be blown away by how easy Clarity is to use, and it's completely free forever. You will never run into traffic limits, or be forced to upgrade to a paid version. It also works across both apps and websites. Stop guessing, get Clarity.

Ayo Omojola (04:12):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny (04:13):
I have a feeling this is going to be a really fun conversation, I was doing a little research on you ahead of this chat and I found this interesting thing that you did in the past, where I found you answered over 100 questions on Quora about people trying to ship stuff and mail stuff, and I have no idea what's going on there. And so, tell us what is going on there.

Ayo Omojola (04:32):
In 2015 I'd been at Cash App for about a year, had massive burnout from the last company, went through IC, kind of like did a hard pivot, imploded a little bit, stuff kind of picked up, sold the company eventually. And my brother, who's my co-founder, and I had this idea, and I think it was actually from printing and mailing my section 83B for something that I'd done. And I was like, "Why can't I just go onto the internet and do this?" And so I had this idea to build an application where you could give it a document and an address, and we would print it and mail it for you. And it was right around when Lob was founded, which was...

(05:13):
Lob is like this printing and mailing API. So we built this thing called Mailform, I think it's like one of the top consumer print and mail things on the internet. I'm sure many people who listen to this will have used it for... And then we had to figure out how to grow it, and the way that I actually learned how to do SEO was running around the internet, trying to find ways to tell people that we did this, and that they would find us. And we actually ended up, funny as it turns out, we ended up building a whole sort of SEO content infrastructure around it that has really impacted my thinking. But all the answers on Quora were me just trying to get people... You know, if you remember like 2014, Quora was like this massive thing.

(06:00):
So all the answers on Quora were me trying to get people who might be thinking about the problem that we were solving to realize that we exist.

Lenny (06:06):
That was my guess, it was going to be either user research on the space of shipping and mailing things, or it was a growth tactic, and it clearly is the second. You're saying this product still exists, that some people can still use?

Ayo Omojola (06:17):
Yeah, yeah, it exists, a lot of people use it. We have maybe customers that you've heard of and use. I won't say their names, because I don't know if they want me to do that. But you know, I would say there are a couple of large delivery tech companies that use us to mail 1099s, W2 forms, what have you.

Lenny (06:39):
Holy moley, okay. And this is just a side project of yours?

Ayo Omojola (06:42):
Yeah, one of many.

Lenny (06:43):
Amazing. Let's talk about your Cash App experience, which I imagine was a pretty transformative period in your career. And from my understanding it had a major impact on the success of the app and the business that was built there. To give folks a bit of scale and understanding of just the Cash App in general, can you just briefly talk about how big was it when you joined, like the scale of the app, and then whatever you can share about just the scale today.

Ayo Omojola (07:08):
When I joined Cash App was probably sub 50K actives, like people moving money. Today I think it's north of 50 million actives on a monthly basis, will all different types of money movement, like Bitcoin, PP, card, stocks. And I think it's something like north of 70 or 80 million actives on an annual basis.

Lenny (07:35):
Wow, okay, great. What I want to talk a bit about is that Cash App to me is a rare example of a huge consumer app success story, I've been angel investing for a while now and I've just learned how rare consumer apps work. Like, they never work, and this one worked. Even within a big company, you think that there's a huge chance of something working if they have the support of a big company, and the platform, things like that. Still, they almost all fail. And so what I'm curious about is, what do you think you all did most right, one to launch it successfully in the consumer space, and then two, to keep it growing and scaling to where it got today?

Ayo Omojola (08:13):
My perspective is that, and I think this is a, people don't like this kind of answer.

Lenny (08:22):
I'm exciting to hear this.

Ayo Omojola (08:23):
But the thing Cash App did right was like 10 things, not one. There were like 10 things that actually best in class, like insane talent density, insane focus, very strong at fraud, a lot of the way Brian, and Dustin, and Jesse, and Dangi tried to organize the amount... Like you know, with Jack's support was just really firewalled from the rest of the square, the hero customer was the consumer, not the merchants, so it was like literally in 100% of the trade offs the consumer's needs came first. And that's a very, very hard thing to do, instead of accommodating like... It made people angry, actually. Really insane focus on design, incredible depth in... This is the thing that I think you will appreciate, but it's very hard to appreciate just as a consumer of things, people would be like, "Hey, what's the difference between you and Venmo?"

(09:26):
And the only reason you would ask that is if you just hadn't thought about it for a second. Now, today there's like a lot of convergence on features like... So Venmo's sort of caught up on a lot of the things. But at the time, Venmo didn't have push to debit, Venmo didn't have an instant. For like three or four years in the United States, the fastest and lowest-cost way to move money in the country between any two people who had bank accounts was Cash App. And I think that kind of changed in 2017, when PayPal, Venmo, Apple Cash, et cetera, kind of came out and launched all their things. And so I think actually it's possible that having done only one of those things well, Cash App might have been successful. But I think the reason it's differentially successful in the market today is the compound effect of all those things.

Lenny (10:12):
What are some of the lasting lessons that you take to other consumer apps that you're... Like Carbon Health, for example? Or founders that you work with, because all those things are amazing, hard to replicate sometimes. Is there stuff you extract from them, like, "Here's something that I'm going to do any time I'm building a consumer app"? Is it like the design-related component, is there anything else along those lines?

Ayo Omojola (10:33):
This is the thing I struggle with, I saw on Twitter somebody say this comment, that a lot of times when people describe their success to you what they're really saying is like, "This is my lottery ticket number." So to be honest, before I go down this diatribe I don't actually know which of the things are replicable. I just know kind of what I believe to be true, and I'm trying... Some of it worked, some of it not, et cetera. So I think Cash App, as a team we really cared about what we could do that was different and better than what else existed in market. And for us, for a long time it was instant, and if you look at all the products you'll see this sort of theme, of when you cash out there's an instant option.

(11:20):
When you get a cash card, we issue your card to you instantly. When you sell stocks, money's available instantly. When you sell Bitcoin, money's available instantly. Like literally, there's no like, "Oh, circle, circle, circle processing," it's like, "Available to spend." And I think there's something actually lasting about the concept of instant, because there still in the world today are like lots of businesses and processes that are like asynchronous, but not for any reason other than, that's just the way the world is. So I think that's like one thing that's kind of narrow. And then I would say another thing that I think is really broad is just being really crisp about why what you're doing is different and better than what exists today. And it's like, being different is not enough, because it's very easy to build a thing that's different form what exists today, because you just have to look at what exists today and build something else.

(12:08):
And being better is not enough, because it's also easy to say, "Hey, I'm going to make this thing better and just charge you more money for it." And so I think there's like, different... You optimize for doing a thing that's different, it has to be better than what exists today, and it has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user, or to the buyer, depending on what your market is. And then after all that, it also... You have to be in a domain that matters, because it's very easy to get those three right, to build like a really... How do I say this? A thing that's different and better than what exists today, in a way that matters to end users could also just be art. Which is just like, art is a complex thing to scale.

(12:58):
And so you have to like, then also get the economics right, get the entire pipeline of like how you ship, how you build, how you talk about it, all that stuff has to work as well.

Lenny (13:08):
I think there's some really great lessons there, just to kind of mirror back what you're saying. Just differentiation in this case ends up being really important, and if you're trying to disrupt someone doing something, like say Venmo. Like, you can't just be a better Venmo, you have to be different. And it sounds like instant was the differentiator in this case.

Ayo Omojola (13:25):
For a long time, yeah, yeah. Or rather, it was the cut through the clutter differentiator. There were actually like a lot of other sort of long tail of things that we were doing those different, but it was like, instant was the thing where when someone says, "Hey, why are you betting on Venmo?" I'd be like, "Try and send me a dollar that I can use now," and there was only one app you could do it with.

Lenny (13:46):
And I think the other element of this, it connects to something I'm working on in the newsletter, is when you're trying to find a big idea, especially in B2B, but in this case it worked in B2C, is just, it needs to be important, it needs to matter, like it can't be a better thing that nobody values highly, because then you will make money in B2B, and in B2C people won't even use it. So, these are really great. You mentioned in passing when we were preparing for this that Block was trying to kill the Cash App for a lot of time, early time.

Ayo Omojola (14:16):
I wouldn't say like Block was trying to kill the Cash App. I think that there were many, many people who worked there that absolutely... And I mean this in the nicest way, identities were tied with Square being a merchant business, believed that the investment in Cash App could have been better deployed elsewhere, didn't want to work on consumer. There was just like a myriad of... And then look, I'm sure people who were there [inaudible 00:14:44], like we probably also made mistakes, and didn't communicate well, and didn't sell it well, and so on. But there was a crazy amount of friction, I'll put it that way. A thing I will 100% give Brian credit for is, he was really effective at making sure that we had a shot.

Lenny (15:04):
Zooming out for a moment and thinking about just Square and Block, and how they operate as a product company and as a business, is there anything that you've taken away from that experience that you bring with you to where you are now? Which, I want to talk about next.

Ayo Omojola (15:16):
I don't know necessarily if this was intentional, my guess is it was probably just like a consequence of Square going through, going public and trying to be sort of a rigorous financial institution. I think when you are in a large organization, trying to do a actually new thing, I think small teams are better than big ones, period. And forcing the teams to be like super, sort of thoughtful about hitting milestones and actually adding value, because there's this thing people say about like, "Hey, the startup within a startup, everything's fake." And the reason I think it's fake is because when you're a startup you actually worry about paying the people who work for you, and when you aren't inside of a company you just don't.

(16:02):
And there is just a difference between having that existential fear of, "Are we going to be here tomorrow, and not?" So I think a consequence of not having that existential fear is that it's easy to just be like, "Hey, I need more resources," and the organization has some habits around how you acquire resources, and if the leadership of the... If the leadership building the new thing happened to be good at that, you can have growth in a new project's people size that doesn't match the new project's success and potential. And I think that actually ends up... It ends up being a tax over time.

Lenny (16:36):
That's a really good point, I didn't think about asking about that. But in this case it was a startup within a company that did well, and I also agree, it rarely works and it did here. What is it do you think that was so central to making it work? I know you just talked about it, how would you summarize just like, "Here's the thing everyone should do when they're maybe starting something small within a big company that's new"?

Ayo Omojola (16:57):
There are some macro things where, I do believe we were children of fortune, like mobile, et cetera. When I joined Cash App a lot of the people working on it were fairly tenured, both at Square and just like in their careers, and had done sort of really meaningful things. And as a consequence, I do think there's like... This is a thing I haven't quite been able to articulate well, but there was something around a small, tightly-knit senior team super focused on a problem. And the smallness means just like, less prior miscommunication, and then the tightly-knit means a lot more trust. And then I think Brian was obviously just, he'd been at Square for a long time, he knew the organization well, was a color operator on there, knew like talent, like who was good that he wanted to bring on board.

(17:52):
And I think that combination of things... Well, not my guess is, there are other things. But I think without that thing, it would actually have been really, really difficult.

Lenny (18:02):
I think that's an awesome lesson, just like a small, trusted team that has seniority, and leadership trusts to operate and not just like, "Hey, what the hell are you doing? It's time to share faster."

Ayo Omojola (18:15):
The Cash App team stayed super senior for a long time.

Lenny (18:19):
Mm-hmm. And you said small, how small would you... Was it/what do you recommend when you say it should be a small team for something like this?

Ayo Omojola (18:27):
You know, a lot depends on the thing, I don't think there's a one-shot answer. When I joined Cash App it was like 11 or 12, and it wasn't much more than that for like a year. And I forget how big it was when I left, but we had real scale in a real business before we had a real head count, I guess is the way I would say it.

Lenny (18:27):
Love it, yeah.

Ayo Omojola (18:53):
And you kind of had to fight for every head count. And I think the head count at this point was a Sarah Fryer thing from Square, she was just really, really disciplined about making sure that if you were trying to bring people on and spend the company's money, you really just fight it.

Lenny (19:07):
I think that's a really good takeaway. Let's transition to talking about what you're currently doing, Carbon Health. You went from consumer fin tech to consumer health tech, first of all just real quick, just how did that transition happen? Was that something you planned, or is that just like you went on exploring and that's where you ended up?

Ayo Omojola (19:22):
It was more I went on exploring, that's where I ended up. I'd say there was maybe three parts, there's one part where when I was exploring there was this guy, Russell Fradin, who now works at Carbon, who had... He introduced me to like a third of my network in Silicon Valley. And basically he said, "Hey, there's this guy who's amazing, he was the founder of Udemy, and now he started this company called Carbon Health. His name's Eren, you need to talk to him." And I was like, "Sure." And Eren, I met, and Eren is brilliant, and also had this crazy way of explaining a complex problem in a way that made the solution obvious. And so he was like, "Oh yeah," like, "Here's how we're going to do it, and here's the thing we spent two and a half hours together."

(20:17):
And then at the end I was like, "Oh yeah, this is obvious, somebody should just build this thing." And then I think the second part was, I think everyone's the hero in their own story, I'm no different. So I think when I left Cash App, and when I was thinking about [inaudible 00:20:33] I was thinking of starting a company and doing all this stuff. And one of the muscles that we really just spent a lot of time building Cash App was going really, really deep into like the regulatory sort of wallpaper of the problems we were trying to solve. And so we would have sessions where we'd be sitting in a room, like product, engineering, legal, compliance, et cetera, with some regs literally blown up on a projector screen, and a section of text highlighted, and being like, "Hey, what does this really mean?

(21:02):
"Okay, what if we build a product this way? What if we structure money movement this way," et cetera. And so I casted myself instead as, "Hey, what if I could be good at regulated businesses, instead of just good at money?" And that was the way that I tied the two together. There were a bunch of other sort of very personal ego things, like, "I want to build a team that's mostly founders." Both my parents were doctors, and I'd been through some sort of scary experiences in the healthcare system. So there was just like a part of it that was about sort of mission and background, but the career part was really about, how do you stick the two things together? And I also wanted to learn... There was this thing that happened in my like fourth year at Cash App where I was like, "Oh, there's this other thing that we have to build that would be amazing if we actually built it."

(21:54):
Which is what Pinwheel, the company I'm on the board of, actually is. So I was like, "Hey, we've got to build this platform for payroll," it's like the last giant money movement thing that hasn't really come to move the needle in a long time. And I couldn't get the organization convinced to build it, which kind of is what it is, A. And B, I was like, "Oh, I want to have that insight. Can I have that insight of like what the second thing is faster the same time around?" And I am sad to report that three years in Carbon, I have not had it yet.

Lenny (22:27):
You've got a lot going on, I am not surprised. So I was going to ask, what draws you towards highly-regulated industries being at Cash App? And I like that you already went there, basically you just found that that's maybe the thing that you could get really smart at, and that applies to a lot of different markets. That's an interesting insight about yourself, like, "This could be the thing that I get good at."

Ayo Omojola (22:48):
Yeah, yeah, or differentially better at than other people.

Lenny (22:51):
You kind of like mentioned this off to the side, this idea that you like to hire founders. And can you speak more to that, just like what that means in your day-to-day, and then maybe how your team looks today. Is it mostly founders, or some [inaudible 00:23:05]?

Ayo Omojola (23:04):
Yeah, yeah. I think the team looks today about half and half. So I had this experience going through IC, where... And just kind of growing up, my career in Silicon Valley, where I knew a bunch of founders who were absolute beasts, like incredible people, could do amazing things, and they would bounce off organizations. They would be like, "All right, I'm going to go work at Amazon," and just not last. And when I was at Cash App I went through a bunch of hiring processes where I was like, "Hey, we should try and hire some founders to do this, look at these companies," et cetera. And a thing that would happen that... And this part really isn't about founders, although founders are like one way sort of this happens.

(23:49):
But a thing that would happen quite often is, by the time that as a hiring manager you get a bunch of resumes to look at, like you post the job, a bunch of people apply, you're partnering with a sourcer, by the time you get a bunch of resumes to look at they've screened out everyone that doesn't just like fit inside a box. And it's like, at Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and then at certain set of schools, and then a certain type of experience, et cetera. And so what would happen is like, if you just happened to not look like that profile I don't even see you. And I would say, "Hey, I would like to hire some non-traditional candidates here who were like founders or whatever," and I would just never get it.

(24:33):
It was almost like the machine just worked a certain way, like there was an algorithm, and the algorithm was upstream of me. And I had this belief that sort of these people that I had seen, many of whom have now gone on to start companies that are doing quite well, would be incredible value add. Like basically, it's kind of like, if you could just hold onto a rock for a little bit it can take you pretty far. And so this was one of the things I talked to Eren about actually, early on when I joined Carbon. And I was literally in the job posting, I'd be like, "If you've been a founder before, even if your startup has failed, please apply to this." Because [inaudible 00:25:15] anything common among founders too is, there's like this sort of imposter syndrome that goes hand-in-hand with the chip on the shoulder.

(25:24):
And so my team's much smaller now than it was, but I probably I think the whole time that I've been at Carbon, hired about 15% founders. And I'm actually 100% certain the thesis was right, and I think it just came with costs that were kind of theoretical at the time, and now they're real. I think like the two big costs are if there's any waste or bullshit in your organization, like they fucking see it right away and call it out. And so there's this like, you have to... There are just these scenarios where I'd just be like, I just have to sit and listen to somebody tell me all the things that we're doing wrong. So there's one, it's a way to cut through bullshit, that's one cost. And then I think the second cost is, and I say cost as in like it is not better for the organizations. You have these people come in, they're incredible.

(26:30):
And you really can only keep them for like two, or two and a half years. And so what ends up happening is, they're just like, "Oh, I want to..." Obviously if you're going to be a person that starts a company you're ambitious, so they're like, "I'm going to run a team somewhere else, I'm going to go try some other thing, I'm going to go build a company." And so it's kind of like a team that I think is differentially higher output, but also differentially higher attrition on the market.

Lenny (26:55):
Got it. I was going to ask about the cons, and I like that you shared them already, because I imagine working with a lot of founders adds a lot of stress too.

Ayo Omojola (27:02):
Yeah. I mean, it is unequivocally awesome, like I love it. And I think that the unexpected pro also is, I do think it levels up the team. Like people in a team that is very founder-dense really likes it, and we ended up over time in Carbon like, there was lots of people who founded companies here in multiple functions, not just profit.

Lenny (27:24):
Today's episode is brought to you by LMNT. I just recently discovered this stuff, actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. LMNT is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio, and unlike most electrolyte drinks there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten, or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. LMNT is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes, also dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on LMNT to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams, and the Marines.

(28:05):
You can try LMNT totally risk-free, if you don't like it you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drink, L-M-N-T.com/lenny, and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drink, L-M-N-T.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty. While we're on this topic of team-building and hiring, do you have any other lessons and approaches that you've found to be effective in hiring or team-building? Just general rules of thumb, or philosophies?

Ayo Omojola (28:46):
My biggest thing, and I say this all the time, is when you're hiring you pick the people, but they pick when. So you're actually like, there's these people... There are many, many people on the team who, the time between when I first met them and the time when they joined the team was like months. There was one person who was like, a year and a half almost. And so the way that I operationalize that is, I'm meeting people all the time, and I am just like, "Hey," like, if I meet somebody I want to work with, I'm like, "Hey, how can I add value to your life so you will consider me somebody who you would like to work with one day, so that when the time comes and there's an opportunity for us to work together, you're actually open to it, as opposed to just some guy that you met on a Zoom one time."

(29:31):
And I would say that's like the biggest... The biggest thing is just like, trying to be like, one of my core philosophies in life is that everybody wants something. And most of the time it's not something you have to give, or you can connect them to. But, if it is something that you have to give, or you can connect them to, it's criminal not to, actually. It's like, imagine you, like just imagine you having a conversation with somebody, and that person, knowing that you want something, having it, there's no cost enough to give it to you, and they just don't do it. How crazy is that? And so the way that I sort of bring this to life is, if I meet somebody who I want to work with, I'm like straight up with them about it.

(30:16):
And I'm like, "Hey, I hope we can find a way to work together one day. In the meantime, it looks like the things you want are not to work with me right now, but they look like this kind of [inaudible 00:30:26] things which I'm aware of. Can I connect you to this person, this opportunity, what have you?" And it's not my thing, like actually Russ did this for me when I came just looking by for the first time. He was like, "Hey, I'm not going to invest in your company, I think it's stupid. But here are all these people who might, go meet them." And that was like transformational for me, and it has turned out that over a long enough time horizon it does come back, and you just don't hold the cards close to your chest, just give them away.

Lenny (30:54):
Is there a story or an example of that that comes to mind of you doing that for someone else?

Ayo Omojola (30:59):
No, it's a little bit of a professional hazard because I'm an angel investor, and so I do this for a lot of my founders. But I probably made 600 intros last year, and that probably drove like, at least one person signed up somewhere as an advisor, a couple people took some jobs, a bunch of angel investors invested in companies, a couple of companies found leads for around like, I think it's... I'm not special in this way by the way, like a lot of people do this. It's just, I am very aggressive about it.

Lenny (31:30):
And you're also connected to a lot of people, as you've shared, because of all these things you've done, and the fact that you prioritize this. I think it's a really cool combination of, you really prioritize connecting and helping. Plus you know a lot of people from all the work that you've done, and there's this element you just shared which is just like, give people things that they want, because [inaudible 00:31:49]-

Ayo Omojola (31:49):
Yeah, I'm a reasonably good matchmaker, except in love. Never once introduced two people that dated.

Lenny (31:57):
Let's talk about... No, we'll move on from that. I also think I'm zero, zero for some denominator, I don't even know. I'm going to keep fishing this pool of kind of philosophies of how you build product, and then we'll come back to Carbon Health. I was reading something that you wrote about how you're really big on understanding the thing, like going deep on stuff, just generally as a product leader and as a collaborator. Can you just talk about your approach there, and where you apply that philosophy?

Ayo Omojola (32:27):
This I took away from Cash App, there was... When we were working on the Cash Card, the very first... This is like 2015, 2016, the very first iteration of Cash Card, the head of design at Cash App, this guy Robert Anderson, who's an amazing designer, please hire him if you can, had like this design. He was like, "Hey, I have this design, we're going to do this thing." And I'm like, "Great." I get some sketch files, maybe? PDFs, pre-figma. We mailed them to some card vendors, and the things they send us back are like, you would put this out as the product in your life, in the world? Like, what are you doing? And the consequence, Brian was like, "Hey, we just need somebody to go figure out how to get this thing made." And so I ended up spending a long time just going to different card manufacturing factories around the country, to figure out how do cards get made, what are the possibilities?

(33:26):
Is there new tech we can take advantage of, will the people even talk to us? Is the thing we're talking about even possible? And we ended up doing... At the time there was a... I wouldn't say like super new, it had been on the [inaudible 00:33:38] for a few years, but it wasn't on mainstream cards yet, this concept of laser engraving. And it turns out that the machine that you use to make laser-engraved cards has like thousands of combinations of settings, which all create like a different physical effect. Like you can increase the power setting and literally burn the plastic, and you would get kind of a red, rough texture. And you could decrease power settings, decrease the aperture, and you would get like a really fine, smooth consistency.

(34:09):
And this is like, again, a thing that I learned, which we went through. Between plastic, the overlay, the paper, the envelope, and the finishes, easily 1,000 combinations before we got to like the first version of the Cash Card that was shipped. And there's a team still there, still doing like literally physical card objects that are not the same as anything that exists in-market, just like going into differentiation thing. And then a lot of the stuff we did around our regulatory work, around prepaid, building a digital wallet, et cetera, made me realize that like a thing that would happen very frequently is, you want to work on something and you go talk to an expert. And usually for most people, an expert is not like, hey, the most expert person in the world, because that's a very, very hard thing to know who that is, especially when you're not an expert.

(35:08):
Usually an expert is the most tenured person in the world in the domain that you're questioning, and the length of tenure, and the depth of experience actually can vary very wildly from person to person. And so what happened is like, you go ask somebody something, and they would give you an answer which is like the thing that they believe to be true, they're not lying and it's not malicious, and it's just fucking wonk. And you just have to keep pushing until you get to an answer, like I don't really know the right way to articulate this all the way. But its kind of like, you can't stop until you get to the end. And that's one of the reasons why being in a domain that matters is really important, because that's a very, very expensive activity to do if you're in a small team environment.

(35:55):
So the way that I apply that today, and I'm sure people at Carbon will tell you this, is I end up asking lots of questions that people think don't matter, because I'm like, "Hey, we're trying to optimize something." And usually what I find is, when you're trying to optimize something for the first time they haven't optimized for it. You actually have to re-measure it, you have to re-instrument it, you have to like rebuild all the queries, all the visuals, et cetera from scratch. You have to look at them like 15 different ways, and then every time two things are incongruent you have to go and figure out why, and it's just like tedious work. And in regulated industries, and I think this is...

(36:38):
My guess is this will end up being true in almost any complex environment with a lot of variables, that are kind of... And the more sort of constrained [inaudible 00:36:48] they are, I think actually the more this matters, you can't avoid the details, you just have to get into them. And if you don't, you can still do well but it's actually more than likely fortune than skill.

Lenny (36:58):
You said you ask these questions that don't matter. Is there an example recently? Because that's a really interesting concept, of just a question you asked, or questions you like to ask that are just like, "God damn it, why are you asking these questions?"

Ayo Omojola (37:10):
Yeah. I have, there's like one from yesterday where-

Lenny (37:12):
Yeah, perfect.

Ayo Omojola (37:14):
... there is a field in a database table that tells you why a payment was made. And there's a bunch of values in that field that are very articulate, like, "Hey, this payment was made because it was co-pay, this payment was made because it was the patient was visiting without insurance," right? And then there's like a field, and it's empty. There's a value that's just null, and we use null as like, "Hey..." The way null is described is, after a claim is adjudicated and complete, and the patient has a balance, we leave that field blank if we're just billing the patient for their balance. The problem with that is, if there is any other exception or reason why a payment might occur, and we're in a complex environment, we have over 120 clinics, there's a lot of humans who can press the pay button in a bunch of different places, you will not know if it's included in that field, in that null value field.

(38:15):
And so this is like one of those things where I'm in the middle of a Slack with a colleague who's like, "Why are you asking this question?" And I'm like, "I just need us to put residual balance in that field, if that's what it's for. That's all I'm asking." So I do that a lot, and you know, I think people hate it.

Lenny (38:37):
Did they actually go ahead and do that?

Ayo Omojola (38:39):
We're in the middle of it right now.

Lenny (38:40):
You're in Slack? Okay, right, okay, I love this. So I made a list of kind of these lessons, and I really like this area we're diving into, of just your kind of philosophies to work in life. So just the ones I wrote down is, the importance of going deep, and doing the thing yourself, and not trusting that somebody's response is the end. I love the way you phrased it, of don't stop until you've reached the end, this idea of helping people if you can, connecting people and the power of that, having founders, and working with founders. And clearly the story you just told is very founder mentality, of just like going in the warehouse and trying 100 different cards. Is there more here? What else have you found to be an important approach to leadership, or product building, or things along those lines.

Ayo Omojola (39:29):
Yeah. Can I say one caveat about the first one I think you wrote down?

Lenny (39:34):
Yes.

Ayo Omojola (39:34):
It's not that you have to do everything yourself, it's that the person who you trust in the execution role, they have to become the expert. They have to be like, they can't stop until they hit the end. And, I don't know. I think in all these places where strong, ambitious people are trying big things, so much value is lost when the person in the execution role isn't really in command of all the details, and is like... So I think the reality's like, to do ambitious things you have to work with people, I can't do everything myself and I know that. The real lesson there is, it's not like I have to, just, somebody has to. And you know, they have to know that that's like what you're holding them accountable for, and that you trust them to do that, and the organization's trusting them to do that as well.

Lenny (40:30):
How do you actually operationalize that? It sounds like part of it is to hire founders who naturally want to do the thing well. Is there anything else in terms of how you set up the team where like, this person has power to do the things that need to be done? Is it like an autonomy perspective? Is there anything else you do that allows for that in a product team, in a company?

Ayo Omojola (40:48):
It's like a trust but verify, and I think it's just almost never enough for someone to say, "I can't do it because X person said." It is, "I can't do it because we are contractually obligated to do this another way, and if we do not honor the contract these will be the consequences." And another thing I like to do kind of along this is like, "Okay, articulate to me what actually will happen if we don't do it this way. Like, what will break? Like, are they going to fine us, is the patient going to be..." Do you know what I mean? Because in my mind there are many things that are used as excuses, because some person's understanding of how some regulatory thing works from like their last job is being applied here, where you're literally creating a worse experience for your consumer, for your patient. I'm like, "Why would you... If we're not here to try and make the experience better for them, why are we even here?"

Lenny (41:43):
Let's come back to Carbon Health for a bit, I just have a couple of questions that I wanted to touch on. One is just about starting a company in healthcare, in health tech, there's so many companies that launch every day, every week, trying to make the healthcare industry better in various ways. But for all these reasons, I don't know, the incentives are off, there's regulatory capture, there's things take a long time, things just like often don't work. Carbon Health is an example of something that is working really well. What is your advice often to founders who want to go after the healthcare space as a tech company? What do you need to know, what should you do right, do wrong? What is your advice there?

Ayo Omojola (42:23):
Yeah, so one thing I would say in healthcare that fortunately or unfortunately I think is true, is very often the way to make things happen is network-dependent, not necessarily about the merit of the thing itself. So it's just like, there's companies that exist because the founders know the CEO of every major payer in the country, and so there's just like a deal they can get, or data they can get that's not available in any other context. So I think there's just a thing there of understanding if that's the business that you're in. I think in Eren and Caesar's case in Carbon, because we're direct to consumer, we're not trying to sell to payers, we're not trying to sell to employers. And Eren, obviously just hugely successful, [inaudible 00:43:13] person starting the largest education platform on the planet at Udemy.

(43:18):
There was actually really, really good founder market fit, he was a person who had very, very technical, and had a ton of DTC success doing another thing that was DTC. But there are businesses, like there's a company that I recently invested on working with, where the founders are incredible and very, very technical, and not super high on network. And so a lot of what I try to do with them is like, "Hey, I need this person to talk to this person. And then also, this is like a really crisp, specific use case that you need to optimize around." And maybe I'm wrong, who cares, I'm just some guy. What does it matter what I think? It doesn't have to be what I think, it just has to be crisp. And using that as a way to like... Because the more crisp it is, the easier it is going to be for you to know who the decision-maker and the organization you need to get to is.

(44:05):
Because I just find... I'm sure you see this in B2B, this is so much... There's just so much leverage in knowing the person in the place who actually has their finger on the button, versus trying to network your way in, and people don't want to spend their social capital introducing you to this department, or they've just got like 19 other things going on. So I think that network thing is just a thing that sticks in my mind, that when I see a lot of healthcare tech startups swimming through the soup, a lot of it is about there's some organizations that have to navigate to get to the right decision-maker, and they have to do it 100 times. And so much of it is like, just waiting for the guy who promised me the intro to make the intro.

Lenny (44:48):
That is really good and practical advice. Before we wrap up, I want to give you a chance just to describe Carbon Health for folks that may not be familiar with it. Just like, what is it, where can you use it, how do you sign up, who's it for?

Ayo Omojola (45:00):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh great, yeah, very, very happy to do this ad, it is a paid ad because Carbon Health pays me. So-

Lenny (45:08):
No-one's paying me, I'm losing in this situation.

Ayo Omojola (45:12):
I'm paying you in prestige, Lenny.

Lenny (45:14):
Yes, in wisdom, in insights, and your attention, yeah.

Ayo Omojola (45:17):
Yeah, exactly, exactly. So, Carbon is an extremely vertically integrated healthcare provider based in the United States. By extremely vertically integrated, what I mean is we build and run the clinics, the providers work for carbon, and we build and run the software, and we run the entire operation, and it's all like full stack in-house. And when I say we build our own software it's like, wait, how you book, how you pay, the literal buttons that the provider presses to say, "Hey, Lenny's blood pressure looks good," all of that is software that we build in-house, all the way from front, from like the patient clicking book an appointment on Google.com to the claim being sent to the insurer, we build the whole thing full stack ourselves.

(46:04):
We have, I want to say 130 clinics around the country, I believe we're in about 17 states. We do virtual care, I think we're one of the biggest healthcare providers in California, and we do both urgent care and primary care. And the thing that gets me super-excited about Carbon is, a lot of the experiences we build are the things that as a consumer, you believe should exist in healthcare. So I want to say, last year we launched this diabetes program where you slap on a continuous glucose monitor, you link it to Carbon, and it streams your blood glucose measurements directly into our EMR natively, and your providers can see it and interact with you around it. They can help intervene, they can tell you like new dietary, lifestyle choices to make. And we're going to do that with every device at some point, on some scale, and you don't have to pay $200 a month to use it. $200 a year-

Lenny (46:04):
Amazing.

Ayo Omojola (46:55):
... to use it, sorry.

Lenny (46:59):
Amazing. Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, I'm going to go through them pretty quick. We'll see what comes to mind, no pressure, you can skip them too if you want. You ready?

Ayo Omojola (47:11):
Yeah.

Lenny (47:13):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Ayo Omojola (47:17):
Three-Body Problem, Children of Time Trilogy, and Stormlight Archive.

Lenny (47:24):
And are these all sci-fi books?

Ayo Omojola (47:26):
The third is fantasy.

Lenny (47:29):
Good clarification, great. Amazing. I'm reading an epic sci-fi book right now called The Fire in the Deep.

Ayo Omojola (47:37):
Oh dude, amazing.

Lenny (47:39):
Okay, yes.

Ayo Omojola (47:40):
So, something that's going to really piss you off... I don't think this is a spoiler.

Lenny (47:43):
Don't, don't, no spoilers, I'm almost done.

Ayo Omojola (47:45):
It's not a spoiler. The story's not finished.

Lenny (47:52):
Mm-hmm, there's like additional books that aren't done yet?

Ayo Omojola (47:55):
Yeah. And I don't even know if they're being written, it's brutal.

Lenny (47:58):
That's okay. I find that the first book, except for the Three-Body Problem where the first book is the worst book, I feel like with this and many of these books, the first one is like... I'm just going to stop I think at the first one, that's my plan.

Ayo Omojola (48:11):
So I'd say, the other two are in my opinion very clever explorations of types of intelligence, from [inaudible 00:48:19]-

Lenny (48:18):
Excellent timing for studying what might happen with AGI. Great, I love where this is going. Next question, what's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Ayo Omojola (48:29):
War of the Worlds was exceptional.

Lenny (48:32):
Is that recent?

Ayo Omojola (48:34):
Yeah, there's one that I think that it was a three-season thing, just ended maybe last year. And it's like a kind of more modern take, and it's just very thoughtful, and it's sci-fi, but such deep drama. I also love Succession, but I haven't got through season two yet.

Lenny (48:52):
Man, this season is incredible.

Ayo Omojola (48:55):
I know, I know.

Lenny (48:56):
You've got to get there, you've got to get there.

Ayo Omojola (48:58):
I know, I had to mute it on Twitter because I was like, "You guys are ruining it for me."

Lenny (49:01):
Oh man, that's impossible to avoid. You just have to delete your Twitter account, I think is the only strategy. There's an amazing Twitter account called No Context Succession, and they just-

Ayo Omojola (49:11):
Love it, love it.

Lenny (49:12):
... yeah, and they just tweet random clips. But it's going to totally [inaudible 00:49:15]-

Ayo Omojola (49:15):
My favorite Succession meme is the Kendall on the phone, "It would be good to connect, it would just be good to connect," just like, such a metaphor for life.

Lenny (49:27):
Interesting, very subtle. Oh, I see what you're saying. That feels so appropriate to you, Ayo. Just connecting people, it's like the core of your being. I could see why you love that meme. Next question, what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're hiring, interviewing?

Ayo Omojola (49:43):
This one's not super crisp, it's like there's kind of two sides to the question. It's like a, tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work, or tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work. Like, tell me a bad decision that worked out, or a good decision that did not, is like I think the way to frame it. And it's a lot of like, my process is just teasing out introspection, it's just like, "Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked, and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions?"

Lenny (50:14):
Final question, do you have a pro tip for mailing something or shipping something from your experience helping everyone on Quora mail and ship stuff?

Ayo Omojola (50:24):
I'd say my biggest hack is like, if you're doing anything local where you're just like taking something point-to-point, Uber can do it for you.

Lenny (50:32):
Mm-hmm, a courier.

Ayo Omojola (50:33):
I literally sent somebody cookies recently, and I was like, "Oh." A guy showed up at my house, I gave him a bag of cookies, and my friend texted me a couple hours later and was like, "Thank you."

Lenny (50:47):
That is a hack. Ayo, this was amazing, you're an amazing human, I really appreciate you making time for this. Thank you for being-

Ayo Omojola (50:47):
Thanks, man.

Lenny (50:53):
... here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, but more maybe ask you followup questions? And, how can listeners be useful to you?

Ayo Omojola (51:02):
I am on Twitter @ay_o, and I write at kunle.app, K-U-N-L-E.app. And the way listeners can be useful to me is tell me what I'm wrong about, I love that. Just be like, "Hey, you said this thing. It's false, here's an example of why," I love that.

Lenny (51:23):
I love these answers to this question, because people love to leave comments on YouTube, and so we'll see-

Ayo Omojola (51:23):
Oh, sweet.

Lenny (51:29):
... what comes in. We'll see what the YouTubers find for us.

Ayo Omojola (51:31):
Oh God, what did I just sign up for?

Lenny (51:33):
We'll find out, here we go.

Ayo Omojola (51:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (51:36):
All right, well thank you again so much for being here, and bye everyone.

Ayo Omojola (51:40):
Awesome, thanks for doing this. Thanks for having me.

# $46B of hard truths: Why founders fail and why you need to run toward fear | Ben Horowitz (a16z)

## Transcript

Ben Horowitz (00:00:00):
The worst thing that you do as a leader is you hesitate on the next decision. The thing that causes you to hesitate is both decisions are horrible. Probably one of my bigger ones on that was we went public with $2 million in trailing 12 months revenue at 18 months old. That's obviously a bad idea. But the truth of it was the alternative was going bankrupt, and that's a worse idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
It's a very difficult and painful to be a CEO, to be a founder. In spite of that. So many people want to start companies.

Ben Horowitz (00:00:29):
The psychological muscle you have to build to be a great leader is to be able to click in the abyss and go, "Okay, that way's slightly better. We're going to go that way. If everybody agrees with the decision, then you didn't add any value because they would've done that without you." So the only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
You are famous for writing one of the most popular pieces of literature for product managers.

Ben Horowitz (00:00:52):
What I was trying to get out in Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager, was the job is fundamentally a leadership job. And it's a tricky leadership job because nobody is actually reporting to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:06):
There's always this kind of sense that the PM is not the mini CEO. How dare you call yourself that? I actually think that's exactly what the PM is.

Ben Horowitz (00:01:12):
It doesn't matter if you write a good, spec or you have a good interview or you do this or do that. What matters is that the product works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:21):

Ben, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Ben Horowitz (00:04:17):
All right, thank you Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:19):
I'm even more excited to have you here.

(00:04:21):
I want to start with a question that a close friend of yours suggested I ask you, Shaka Senghor. So Shaka, he's, we could do an hour just on how interesting this guy and the things he's done.

Ben Horowitz (00:04:32):
Three hours on Joe Rogan that day. He is very-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):
So we're not going to do that. Just to give a glimpse, he was in prison for 19 years. He was in solitary for seven years. He led a huge prison gang. You wrote about him in your book as a great exemplar of great culture in the prison gang that he ran. So interesting. But something that he learned from you that he told me I need to ask you about is about success and how to be successful and how it's not what people think. And he said that you learned this lesson from a pilot. What is that story? What is that lesson?

Ben Horowitz (00:05:08):
I mean, I would say it's a long life lesson. But the pilot story is I actually, I ask people silly questions sometimes when they meet them. And so I met this gentleman who was a pilot and it was right around the time JFK Jr. crashed his airplane and ultimately died. And I asked him, I was like, "What happened?" Because there's always the story in the press, and I know this from them writing about me or anything, is it's always what's the best narrative not what's true. So you can never actually find out what happened, you just find the best story version of what happened.

(00:05:53):
And the story in the press was all about, "Oh, he wasn't trained on instrumentation was flying at night." And I wanted to know is that right? And the pilot said, "Well," he said, "really, it's like all plane crashes are a series of bad decisions. And none of the decisions by themselves is that bad, but when you add them up, it's bad."

(00:06:14):
So the first decision was he needed to get wherever he was going and that was the priority. And in flying, that can't ever be the priority because there are conditions, there are things that happen. And then the second one was, "Well, his timing of when the sun would go down was wrong." So he thought he'd be flying in sunlight and he wasn't. And then once he got up there, it was when the plane was going down making it go up was a bad decision because he was upside down. And so it was like, I can't remember all the things, but this guy had 17 bad decisions in a row. And the big thing for me that I felt was really true is it's one decision leads to another. And so if you can break psychologically, you can take the sunk cost, then that gets you out of a lot of bad paths. And then a little good decision may be difficult, but you have to believe it's going to lead to the next one. And a lot of success is about that. It's a small thing, a small thing that's hard to do that doesn't seem to have a high impact, but it leads to the next small hard to do thing and then eventually you get an outcome, so that was kind of the concept.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:46):
So the lesson there is just success is just a bunch of little things. It's not this, "Cool, I got here in a big thing."

Ben Horowitz (00:07:52):
If somebody were to write a story about me, they would be like, "Then Ben this really smart thing and blah, blah, blah, happy ending." But it really wasn't like that and I don't think it's like that for you or anybody. And I spent a lot of time with Shaka on how, because it's always your own psychology that gets you. And one of the most insightful things he said to me is, because most people who are in solitary for seven years, that's it. You're insane. You're never coming back from that. It's just an impossible thing. But if you study his story, he actually really was massively self-improved coming out of solitary, and he wouldn't recommend that for anybody, just to be clear. It wasn't solitary. But what it was was he changed, in solitary he was able to change a big set of beliefs that he had about himself that got him out of that.

(00:08:50):
And the thing that his conclusion from it, which I thought was really interesting, he's like, "Look, was in prison for 19 years. I was in solitary for seven. I come out, I can't rent an apartment, I can't vote, I can't get a gun, I can't do, no rights. None of that was anything compared to what I did to myself."

(00:09:08):
And I think that's very true for CEOs in general and people in general is all the things that you perceive that are happening to you that are bad, be it the systems against you or somebody undercuts you or racism or sexism or this or that or the other is very small compared to ... It means a lot if you believe it. If you believe what people say about you, if you believe what they did to you, then that destroys you. But if you go, "That's not me," you can overcome almost anything. And he's got a new book out on that anyway that I think is very good because that's the, I'd say more than anything, that's the key to success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:52):
If you look at all the writing you've done, it's essentially about the struggle and pain and suffering of being a CEO, your first [inaudible 00:09:59] to Hard Thing About Hard Things. There's a lot of talk these days about just how important struggle is and how valuable it is to go through struggle. Jensen's big on this. He talks a lot about just you have to go through pain and suffering to be a great leader.

Ben Horowitz (00:10:12):
You don't really have a choice. That's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:15):
There's something that I saw you share that I love, which is running towards fear versus running away from fear. Something that you tell all your leaders to work on. Easy to hear, hard to do. We don't like doing things that are scary, running towards things that are scary. Why is this so important? Why is this something people need to learn to do?

Ben Horowitz (00:10:33):
Well, so the biggest mistake that you make, the worst thing that you do as a leader, there's things in your control and there's things out of your control and hesitation, that's generally the most destructive. And I go through all the ways that it's destructive, but it's extremely bad. And the thing that causes you to hesitate is both decisions are horrible. It's that business school where you're going through a case study, "And if you had done that, then the company would have gone this way. But if you had done that, it's a great success." That's not actually what happens to you as CEO.

(00:11:16):
What happens to as CEO, it's like, "Okay, if we rearchitect, this product, the architecture is not actually get us to where we need to go. I kind of know that. But if we rearchitect it, we're going to probably miss all the features, miss the quarter, have trouble raising money, shudder, et cetera. So that's really bad. And then not rearchitecting is really bad, and so I'm just going to try to and avoid this subject because I don't even want to deal with either of those." And that's the worst thing, because if action is the better choice and that's good. And then if you don't make an explicit decision, then the whole company's going to get nervous because they know that the architecture is whack and you got to fix it.

(00:12:07):
And probably one of my bigger ones on that was we went public with $2 million in trailing 12 months revenue at 18 months old. That's obviously a bad idea. I mean, there's no question that wasn't a bad idea. But the truth of it was the alternative because of where the private markets were was going bankrupt. And that's a worse idea.

(00:12:34):
And if you look at that time, March of 2001 when we went public, you just look at the number of CEOs that hesitated on that and didn't do it and went bankrupt. It's a lot. And so that getting good at making a decision that everybody's going to go, "Wow, that was insane, Ben." The Wall Street Journal wrote a whole long story about how stupid I was. And then Businessweek wrote a story called the IPO From Hell. That was the name of our idea, the IPO from hell, which was accurate in a sense.

(00:13:13):
So that's really bad, but it wasn't as bad, and this is why it's so scary you make that decision that's going to happen. I knew those stories would get written, there was no question. And yeah, that's the kind of muscle. So if you think about the psychological muscle you have to build to be a great leader is to be able to look in the abyss and go, "Okay, that way slightly better. We're going to go that way. And it's very hard to do." I would say it's a thing people struggle with. And it began something, should I fire the head of sales? So I don't want to have that conversation. And then I'll have to replace them. And then there's going to be a bad PR story. And you can kind of quickly calculate all the bad stuff that's going to happen if you do it. But if you don't do it, that's probably going to be much worse and that's why you have to run towards the pain in darkness.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:13):
What is the advice you share with founders? Because as you said, it's very hard to do this, just what helps them actually get better at this? Is it just Ben being by their side telling them this is how it is? Is there anything else you can share?

Ben Horowitz (00:14:23):
No, no. I would say this is one where I can't really coach you to be good at this. I can point it out so that you recognize that you were slow or whatever. But it's kind of like I always liken when I talk to them, it's like football. You can have a really fast great athlete, but if they don't trust their eyes, if they don't run to the ball when they see it, if they think, "Oh, maybe that was a fake," then they're that step slower and then they'll never be as good. And CEOs are like that. If you don't trust what you see and you don't run at it, then you're just not going to be good. And it's hard to get CEOs not to hesitate. But look, the thing that does help is they look at it and I look at it and I confirm, "No, that is as it appears."

(00:15:23):
And sometimes they're afraid of the conversation. So that one I can help with. So A CEO might be afraid, like they want to do something but they don't know how to say it. They don't know how to have the conversation with the employee so I can walk them through that. I had an instance where the CEO said, "Hey, I need your help, Ben. My CTO, he's an asshole." And I was like, "Okay, great." I said, "But you're not going to fire him because I know he's a good CTO, or are you asking me should you fire him?" He said, "No, no, I don't want to fire him." And I was like, "So you're asking me what to do? You don't know how have that conversation with him about being an without him quitting. That's what you're saying?" And he goes, "Yeah, that's the problem."

(00:16:09):
And so I go, "Well, why is he an asshole?" And he says, "Well, he's an asshole because the other day he made a very junior young woman in our finance organization cry." And I was like, "Yeah, I got you." I said, "Look, this is what I would say to him. I'd say I just sit them down and I would say, 'Look, you're a really good director of engineering because you do a great job at managing the team, get the products out, all that. But you're not really a CTO because to be a CTO, you have to be effective with other parts of the organization. You can't just be effective only with engineering. And making somebody cry, she's never going to do anything you want. You lost all effectiveness with all of finance by doing that. And so if you want to get good at that, I'll help you. I'll work with you on it, but if you don't, I'm going to have to hire a CTO at some point because obviously I need that.'" And then he was like, "Oh, okay, I can have that conversation. I can't have the conversation that, 'Hey, you're an asshole,' because I don't want them to quit, but I can have the conversation that's more specific." And a lot of getting people not to hesitate is just getting them over that.

(00:17:20):
And so often, and I would say early in a CEO's career, a lot of it is just not knowing how to have the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):
There's also I imagine an element of I just want to be liked. I don't want people to hate me. You have this great line that you want to be liked and respected in the long run, not the short run.

Ben Horowitz (00:17:37):
Yeah, that's tricky. By the way, I have to deal with this in the firm too, and people want to be entrepreneur friendly. I'm like, "No, it's not friendly. Respectful. But you've got to be able to tell them the truth in a way that you probably don't tell most of your friends the truth." Because your friend, look anthropologically, we want people to like us. It's just so they don't throw us to the lion or whatever. That's just kind of a thing. So you say tell people what they want to hear, but in dealing at a company level in a context of you're on the board of somebody's company, you've got to be able to tell them what they don't want to hear. That's the most important thing you're going to say.

(00:18:22):
And yes, they're not going to like it when you say it, there's no question. But over time it could save the company. And all the most important things I've said are things that I've said to CEOs that they did not want to hear. And that's what the leadership is about. If everybody agrees with the decision, then you didn't add any value because they would've done that without you. So the only value you ever add is when you make a decision that most people don't like and that's where leadership comes in because you know that's where it's got to get to. And that's the thing that takes practice.

(00:19:05):
I think when Jensen talks about luck, you've got to get to near death to get yourself to do that. That's true. It's hard to build that if everything's going great. And I would say the CEOs who had an easy run of it for their, let's say, they just launched a product that's an instant hit, it's very hard for them to develop that muscle compared to the ones that built a company like Jensen where he gutted it out for multiple decades before they had big success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:36):
Clearly, it's very difficult and painful to be a CEO, to be a founder. In spite of that so many people want to start companies. So many people dream of having their own company. Who is not right to start a company? What advice do you share with folks that are thinking about starting a company that may not understand just what they're about to get into?

Ben Horowitz (00:19:57):
Yeah, so it's funny. So there's a couple of things. John Reed, who was the CEO of Citigroup when I started as CEO, said to me something I never forget. He said, "Ben, the only reason to start a company is because you have an irrational desire to do so, because it's not worth the money." And I was like, "Wow, he doesn't even quantify how much money and this guy's running Citigroup." So he is a very numbers, banking guy and he didn't quantify it. And I remember when we sold LoudCloud for $1.6 billion, I remember thinking, "Wow, that wasn't worth the money whatsoever."

(00:20:37):
So I think if you're doing it for the money, that's a very bad reason and it will be extremely difficult to get you an outcome. You really have to have an irrational desire to do something larger than yourself to improve the world in some way that somehow that is your purpose. And if you don't feel that, then you'll never get through it. It's just too many bad things happen along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:08):
So then how do you think of founders that are looking around for ideas that brainstorm, that look for market opportunities versus come from, "I have this a mission, I've got to do this thing in the world."

Ben Horowitz (00:21:19):
My business partner Mark always talks about that. So if you have a product that forces you to build a company, that is a great case of it, right? Okay, you built something and the world wants it and you need a company to deliver it, you know, already have the right product. And so that's very helpful.

(00:21:37):
I think there are cases of people, I think Hewlett-Packard was built that way, that they're like, "Okay, we've got to build technology," it was that abstract, "We've got built in technology for the world." And then they started with, "Well, what do you need?" They called it the next bench thing. What does the engineer sitting next to me need? The next engineer on the bench? So how they define the first set of products.

(00:22:03):
So it can work the other way, but I think the thing that is in common is it's just a very abstract idea that you have to build something that's going to be important that people are going to like working there, people are going to benefit from the products. You have to have some weird concept other than, "Oh, this is going to be successful and I'm going to make a lot of money." I think way better off taking Zuck's offer at Meta and just doing that. That's a way better deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):
Along these lines, something else Shaka suggested I ask you about, apparently there's a story where the CEO of Databricks asked you for $200,000 in the early days and you said no. And it's not because you didn't want to invest and it was more about helping them think bigger. What happened there?

Ben Horowitz (00:22:55):
So there were six of them, they were six HD student, well, and Jan Stoicka (phonetic) who was their professor. And Jan was this super genius, but when I met with them, they were like, "We need to raise $200,000." And I knew at the time that what they had was this thing called Spark and the competitor was something called Hadoop. And Hadoop had very well-funded companies already running towards it and Spark was open source, so the clock was ticking.

(00:23:39):
And I think they didn't quite know what they had. And then there's also a thing always, although I wouldn't say Jan has this mentality, but professors in general it's a pretty big win if you start a company and you make $50 million. You're a hero on campus. That's a pretty cool thing to have done. And so I'm always a little nervous about a company that comes out of academia thinking too small anyway.

(00:24:09):
And so I said, "Look, I'm not going to write you a check for $200,000. I'll write you a check for $10 million because this company, you need to build a company. You need to really go for it if you're going to do this, otherwise you guys should stay in school." And they were all graduating right then, so that was kind of that. And Ali actually was VP of engineering at the time, and it was a while before I made him CEO and that was very good luck on my part because I had no idea that they had a guide that good inside the company who could become CEO when I invested. That was just, God smiled on me and gave me that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):
So speaking of Ali, I actually asked him what to ask you about, and he immediately shared this story. I don't know if you remember this. In your first one-on-one with him, after you-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
I don't know if you remember this. In your first one-on-one with him, after you made him CEO, he was struggling with a bunch of low performers because he was coming in to lead the company and he was trying to turn things around, trying to coach them, trying to level them up. And your advice to him was quote, "You don't make people great. You find people that make you great, that make the company great, that you learned from, not the other way around." And there's something that he called managerial leverage. What is that all about? What's the lesson there?

Ben Horowitz (00:25:27):
Oh yeah, yeah. So understand, he had just become CEO. So I was teaching him, he had been VP of Engineering and CEO is different. And I'll get into why and what I mean by leverage.

(00:25:40):
So I actually wrote a post about this with a little Wang quote where I think the quote was, "The truth is hard to swallow and hard to say too but I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school." And that was always my feeling about this particular idea was, look, if you're VP of engineering, you can develop people. You can teach them to be better engineers. You can teach them, be better engineering managers. That's very doable.

(00:26:08):
But if you're a CEO, what do you know about being CFO? Like what do you know about being VP, HR? What do you know about any of these jobs except maybe VP of engineering?

(00:26:22):
And so the idea that you're going to take somebody who isn't world-class at marketing and make and you them world class and you don't know anything about marketing, is a dumb idea. It just doesn't work.

(00:26:34):
And then the company can't afford for you to be spending time on that because they need you to make very high quality, fast decisions. They need you to set the direction for the company and they need you to have a world-class team. And so it's a very hard lesson if you've been VP of engineering because if you're a good VP of engineering, you do develop your people.

(00:26:55):
But as a CEO, it's not like you don't do any of it, but it is very, very small compared to it. So I like to make things just very stark. So you get what I'm saying? I don't like to hedge it.

(00:27:08):
And then managerial leverage means it is very simple. It's okay. If I have the ideas about what your department should do next. If I am kind of pushing you to kind of move your organization forward, then that's no leverage. What's leverage is if you're telling me what you should do and how you can push the company forward, that's leverage, then I'm getting more than I'd have if you weren't there otherwise I could just manage a team.

(00:27:39):
And that's the point when you feel like you're not getting leverage. When you got to go say, "Hey, why aren't we doing this? Why aren't we doing that?" That's when you got to make a change. And by the way, he's unbelievable at that, as good as anybody I've seen as a guy who's not callous as a CEO. He really cares about the people who work for him. He really wants him to have great careers and all that, but he does not hesitate. If he's losing leverage, he'll make a move.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):
Kind of going back to the origin story of A-Sixteen-Z something you guys were really big on was helping founders stay COs become great COs, not replace them with professional COs.

(00:28:16):
I want to flip this question on you. When does it actually make sense to replace CO? When are people not going to make great COs?

Ben Horowitz (00:28:26):
There's a very consistent thing that happens, which is when somebody doesn't make it and it kind of starts with confidence is the way I would put it.

(00:28:35):
So if you invent a product, you kind of recruit a team so forth, all of a sudden you're CEO, but you don't run a big organization, you don't know how to do that. Most founders are like that. And so, if you don't know what you're doing, you're going to make mistakes and they all make a lot of mistakes. And then when you make those mistakes, they're very expensive. They could cost you to do a down round or they could cost you to lose a company or they could cost you a customer or you scrub the product. They're very high impact and not just on you, but everybody who you talked into joining you. And so that kind of motion can really cause you to lose confidence.

(00:29:20):
And then if you lose confidence, what happens is you hesitate on the next decision. And as we talked about, hesitation is very dangerous because one, it locks up the company, but even worse what happens is if you have senior people working for you, they get very nervous and they feel like they need to jump into that void and make the decision for you. And that's when it gets political, very political, because people are vying for power inside your little screwed up company.

(00:29:57):
And so now you've got a political dysfunctional organization and that's generally where, okay, the founder probably can't run this thing anymore. That's how it happens.

(00:30:11):
So most of what we do as a firm is to try to help people with that confidence problem and there's a whole series of ideas that we have around that, but you kind of have to somehow climb the confidence and the competency curve together. It's very hard to do and particularly if you're an engineer and you're used to getting things right or if you've been a straight A student or something like that, it's very disconcerting. Sometimes it's better to have CEOs who are like C minus students.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Why is that?

Ben Horowitz (00:30:45):
Yeah, a little facetious. Well, it's just good to be used to failing. So I think I wrote this, but the median on the CEO kind of test is like 18. It's not like 90. And so you got to be comfortable getting a lot of D minuses because the D minus is fine, as long as you don't get the F, as long as you don't run out of cash, as long as you don't lose all thing. Okay, you got through it, keep going. And match, that's a lot of the thing that we try to do CEOs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:20):
Yeah, it comes back to your core, I don't know, message through your first book is just how much you'll fail and how much you'll struggle and how much paid you'll go through as CO.

Ben Horowitz (00:31:29):
Yeah, yeah, and I mean a lot of why I wrote that book was just to nanalyze it. I think what happens is, particularly when I wrote it, and I think it's come back and been true now, is the way the narrative gets written on all these successes is like, "Ph, they came up with a genius idea and then they built this company and they hired all these smart people and it was all great." But that's not at all how it happens and I've spent enough time with everybody from Mark Zuckerberg to Sam Altman and so forth, that they all go through that same thing that who has your struggling company go through? You screw a lot of things up and they have massive consequences, but you have to maintain your confidence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):
Actually, I was at a storytelling event last night and I was chatting with someone that I ran into there and told her I was chatting with you today, and she said how meaningful your first book was to her as a founder. Exactly as you said, normalizing that it's very hard and painful and this is just the way it is.

Ben Horowitz (00:32:36):
And the feeling, look, if you think about organizational design or goals and objectives or OKRs or whatever management technique, you need a basic eighth grade education to do any of that stuff. It is not that complicated. The difficult part is the feeling that you have when you have to do it is very, the hard thing of matter a reorg is you're redistributing power, so you're going to have people really fricking mad at you because somebody's losing power if you do it correctly. And that person may be a really good employee. Dealing with that is the hard thing. Knowing how the organization should work to make communication better, it's not that complex.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:18):
Yeah, I think about I was at Airbnb for a long time and just thinking of Brian, who I don't know even know if he had a job before Airbnb now.

Ben Horowitz (00:33:25):
Oh yeah. I spent a lot of time with Brian and after COVID, it all kind of clicked for him and then he did that he and that good talk on founder mode and so forth. But the reason that was so articulate is he had screwed every one of those things up and he hired LT and all this stuff, and these are very senior people and he wanted to defer to them, but you can't defer as the CEO because you know what Airbnb should be doing. He may know what finance should do, but you know what Airbnb should do and this kind of thing. And then it gets really wild when you can't defer decisions as the CEO. You got to understand what people are saying and go, "Now we're going to do this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:13):
And this again comes back to the point of you have to go through the struggle and pain and failure to learn those lessons.

Ben Horowitz (00:34:18):
Yeah, no. They're really hard to learn without doing and often without paying the consequence. Even I, like I make mistakes. I was having conversation with Ali the other day and I was like, he's like, "How's it going Ben?" And I was like, "Well, I'm finally dealing with something that I had put off for a very long time." And he said, "Why'd you put it off?" I said, "Because things were going too good. I didn't have to deal with it. "And he was like, "Yeah." He said, "I know that." I'd say Ali is one of the, if not the kind of best private company CEO out there, and he's making a mistake and I'm making a mistakes. So, it is just tough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):
You said that one of maybe the main reason founders fail the CEOs is they lose confidence, and you had some ideas that you guys have to help founders work through that. Are there a couple you can share how you help?

Ben Horowitz (00:35:12):
Yeah. So we do a lot of things on that. So the kind of design of the firm is about confidence. So the first thing is, well, what would give you? Well if you can get stuff done. So what if I could give you a network that's as good as Bob Iger's network, day one, the day you stepped into the job.

(00:35:31):
And so we have 600 people at the firm and why is that? Well, most of them are building that network for you, so you can call any CEO or anybody in Washington or any executive or that kind of thing and get them on the phone and they'll talk to you and you can kind of deal with that thing. And then that just makes you feel like a CEO.

(00:35:55):
And then we have a lot of people in the firm like myself, who you can talk to on a CEO to CEO basis, as opposed to an investor to CEO, and just kind of feel that. Early in the firm days, we used to do this thing. I think I'm going to bring back in some form this thing called the CEO barbecue. And it was like a lot of people have these events where they bring in speakers and this and that and the other. And I always felt like those were one, they were too many days. And then sometimes what they said wasn't really applicable and that kind of thing.

(00:36:32):
So I said, "Why don't we just have a barbecue?" I would barbecue. We get everybody in my backyard because was 500 people at the peak, which is why at the stuff I couldn't cook that much, that kind of stuff. And then we'd have Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg and Kanye West, and so you're a CEO in there with portfolio. You're like, "Wow, I must be important. I'm here with all these guys" and we're just hanging out having a drink, eating barbecue.

(00:37:04):
And so then when I go back to my company, I feel like I am somebody. And okay, I might not be perfect at all this, but I am really a CEO. I was at the CEO barbecue, for crying out loud and that kind of thing. But the whole idea was always like, "Okay, do you feel like you can do it?" Because that's half the battle?

(00:37:29):
And look, having been in and every CEO has been in a position where they feel like, "Well, maybe I shouldn't be the one running this thing. Maybe it's just too big for me." And that's a bad, you don't want to go there. And because as we've said, founders can get to the next product and that's something that almost no professional CEO is able to do. There've been rare cases, but very rare.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:57):
So clearly you've worked with a lot of companies, a lot of founders. Let me kind of zoom out a little bit and ask you this question.

(00:38:03):
What's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building companies that goes against common startup wisdom?

Ben Horowitz (00:38:09):
Well, the common startup wisdom keeps changing. One of the early ones that was wrong, and Brian articulated it, and then now I think a little bit of what people have gone to is also wrong.

(00:38:25):
So the first idea that was wrong was like, okay, build a team of senior executives as soon as you get product market fit as fast as possible and they can scale the thing. And I think that you got to build that team slowly and deliberately, kind of pace to your ability to integrate and then manage them. Because if you bring in a bunch of senior people and you don't know really how they match to your company or how that function works or so forth, then you're going to start deferring. And once you start deferring, it's going to get out of control very fast because they're going to build empires, they're going to get political, they're going to do all that kind of thing.

(00:39:08):
So that was bad advice. You kind of have to do it in a measured way. I think that founder mode, I think a lot of people have taken to never hire anybody with experience. And that's also bad advice in that, look, somebody who knows how to do something can really accelerate your thing. So very early on, one of the founders, great founder Arsalan at Databricks was running sales. And I'm like, "Oli, you're going to have to hire somebody who knows sales because Arsalan's, PhD in computer science. I like that, but that's probably not where you're going to have to start if you're going to catch these guys before they take Spark and use it against you."

(00:39:53):
And I sat down with Arsalan and I explained why. I said, "Look, a lot of what sales, there's a lot of knowledge in how to build a worldwide sales organization; maybe knowledge of customers, territories, territory splitting, rep profiles. There's just a litany of stuff that you really can only learn by doing trial and error and you don't know anything. And so you're phenomenal. Let's get you. And still, he's a very senior executive in the company now, but we need somebody who knows that. And the idea that there are companies that go, " Okay, we're just not going to hire that in founder mode." That's also a mistake. So there's a lot of, it's more subtle than you think, and it's more complex than you think. And so you kind of have to get all the way to the truth. And these little snippets of advice that he sees good, because they watch some fucking podcasts, are all fucking stupid.

(00:40:51):
There's a lot of depth to these things. You have to know the answer to the next question, the next question and the next question, and it does drive me crazy. One of the funnier things that happened along these lines, just to show you how little. You know as an investor, about what it means to be CEO.

(00:41:11):
We were at a board dinner. One of the CEOs says to me, he goes, or one of our CEO says, "Hey Ben, that thing you told me a while ago about don't be CEO at home." He said, "I was doing that and I stopped and it really helped me."

(00:41:28):
And then the other kind of VC said, " Yeah. You got to unplug some time." And I said, I was like, "What the fuck are you talking about? He's CEO. He's not unplugging. He's getting shit all the fucking time. He's got to deal with that. That was not what I meant. I was like, you can't go home and boss your family around. That's what I meant."

(00:41:48):
You hear something from somebody who, but if you haven't done it, you don't even know what that means. And so then you then trying to transfer the advice to the next guy, that's not going to work. So anyway, but he was very innocent. I just don't want to kind of speak bad of him, but that's how it sounds, right? But that's not what it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
That's an amazing story. So the advice partly here, is just don't believe everything you see on Twitter and little sound bites of advice.

Ben Horowitz (00:42:18):
I think actual CEOs know it. And that's kind of how people in my profession going to get a bad wrap. Because giving advice, that's not something that you know but something that you heard, is very dangerous, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:31):
So speaking of advice that you've shared that might be out of date now, you are famous for writing one of the most popular pieces of literature for product managers. There's a lot of PMs that listen to this podcast called Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager. And if you actually go to that post today at the top you say, "This document was written 15 years ago and it's probably not relevant today for PMs. I present this nearly as an example of a useful training document."

(00:42:56):
Still people link to it. I actually just link to it as just like this is something every PM needs to read. What is it that you think people should maybe not take away from it, and what do you think people still should take away from that piece?

Ben Horowitz (00:43:07):
Yeah, so the reason I wrote it when I wrote it was that I had a lot of product managers. And one thing about product management is it's a job that's completely different at every company and there is no training for it. So everybody kind of figures it out as they go. And depending on what's being emphasized, they'll get wrapped around the axle on if it's an enterprise company, well pitching to customers or I need to be really good with the press, or I need to be really good at writing the product requirements document or that kind of thing.

(00:43:49):
And those are all these tasks, but none of those were the job and what I was trying to get out in Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager was, the job is fundamentally a leadership job and it's a tricky leadership job because nobody is actually reporting to you.

(00:44:14):
So it's like this influence, how do I get people to do what I want even though I'm not paying them. I can't fire them. I can't promote them, and so forth, which is kind of the essence of real leadership because if you start to rely on promotion and firing and so forth for authority, then you're never going to be good at being CEO or anything.

(00:44:38):
So I wanted them to get into the mindset of, "Okay, your actual job is to get a product into market that customers love that's better than anything that anybody else in the world puts in market. That's your job." And so to accomplish that job, you need engineering to understand you with clarity. You need to understand engineering with clarity. You need to have a really good view of the market and the competitors and the technology and so forth and you need to put that all together and deliver the thing.

(00:45:17):
And all the other things are tasks that you may or may not need to do. I don't know if you need to do them, but the thing is, you have to be the leader. You've got to get the thing done. And so what I think it's still good on is that the mindset, be the leader, I think the details of any kind of thing that was kind of task specific was really for my group a Netscape in 1996, whenever the hell I wrote it.

(00:45:56):
So as a kind of document I wrote out of frustration. But I am glad that the people still like it, and I think leadership in general is undervalued, underestimated. It's the most powerful thing. And most of the great companies, Jensen is a great example. What a phenomenal leader he is not just of Nvidia, but of the whole industry. And he doesn't have authority over the industry, but he drives it forth and that's why the Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager is so important because that thing, if you learn how to do it, that's the thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:39):
I didn't realize you wrote that initially as just an internal document and then you made a-

Ben Horowitz (00:46:44):
It was kind of before blogging took off, so it is just an internal thing and I published it later. I was just getting so mad. And by the way, my product management team at the time was very good, very talented people. They just were not getting that concept. So like David Wyden said, Coastal Ventures, Raghu Raghuram, who wanted on to be CEO of VMware, the team was like that team, but they were driving me crazy. And so I was like, "I can't yell at people anymore. I have to explain to myself." And so it's a good thing if you find yourself yelling at people, you probably haven't explained what you want, was the other big takeaway from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:30):
Did you ever think that piece would be so long-lasting? And so, I don't know, popular?

Ben Horowitz (00:47:34):
I didn't even know. I thought it was kind of like aggressive when I wrote it. You could tell I was mad. I called a Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager. It's like bad dog, bad, bad, bad product manager. That was kind of the emotion I had. So, it is kind shocking some of the things that you write.

(00:47:54):
I would say that that's and kind of creative, and you probably know this. The idea is that you have the things that you write in five minutes end up being much better than things you write in five weeks. And I find in talking to musicians or writers or everybody has that same experience. The thing that you've already synthesized so much that you just have to write it out, that's the best stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):
There's something that you mentioned there in your answer about the PM being the leader. There's always this kind of sense that the PM is not the mini CEO. How dare you call yourself that. I actually think that's exactly what the PM is. They're basically the closest to the CO. Their kind job is to think like the CEO within the team.

Ben Horowitz (00:48:39):
People get mad because everybody, this is the whole challenge of management in general. People get jealous over stewardship. But from the perspective of the PM, it doesn't matter if you write a good spec or you have a good interview or you do this or do that. What matters is that the product wrench. And you have to get all the way to there and work backwards from that and you can't do that without leadership because it is about, okay, we want to build that. And you're not necessarily the person who comes up with every idea or this or that, or that. You're just the keeper of the vision.

(00:49:22):
And that's true for CEOs too. You don't want every idea in a company coming from the CEO. I think it's a misunderstanding of what a CEO is, is why people don't like that. They don't know what a CEO is. But a CEO isn't the one who has every idea it gives, every order does every. That's not the way it works.

(00:49:40):
The way it works is there's somebody who's got to consolidate, get all the good ideas, prioritize them, decide which good ideas we're going to do, and then get everybody on the same page, so that they have very high fidelity understanding of what that is. And so that it is a CEO, kind of function. Now, it doesn't mean I'm better than you, it just means that...

Ben Horowitz (00:50:00):
... kind of function. Now, it doesn't mean like I'm better than you. It just means that that's what I'm doing.

(00:51:16):
Let's talk about AI. I'm very proud of us. It's been almost an hour. We haven't even mentioned AI. I think that's a record. Okay, so I asked Adam Neumann, WeWork founder, now Flow founder, someone you work closely with now what to ask you about. And he said he has some really interesting insights about how AI is impacting hiring.

Ben Horowitz (00:51:35):
Adam is probably the single most controversial investment that we ever made. We got called everything from stupid to sexist to racist to this and that for literally just funding that. And I think it's going to end up being one of the best investments we ever made. He's doing a phenomenal job there. There's an important principle in that which we do as a firm, which I think is not widely done, but I would love it if people copied it, which is, and it's something I learned somewhat from Shaka, which is you don't judge a person by the worst thing that ever happened to them. We've all had bad things happen to us. We've all made bad decisions. Most of them, they don't make a miniseries about.

(00:52:35):
And so to judge them on that, you want to judge people on what they do well, not what they screwed up, because that's where you see the talent. If you look at what Adam did well, it's truly spectacular. Everybody knows WeWork. Name a more important commercial real estate brand than WeWork. You can't. And so what an accomplishment. And there were so many things that went into that and so many things he did right.

(00:53:10):
And then if you kind of look at really unravel the things that went wrong, most of it was like a combination of inexperience and nobody around him that would tell him the truth. And, yeah, maybe he wasn't good at listening to the truth either at the time, but to throw away a guy on that, which is by the way, the world was so mad at us for not throwing him away, for believing in him, is just that it's a big mistake. And I credit Mark because Mark is the one who called him up originally, and just said, "Hey, Adam, what are you doing?" Because we watched what you did at WeWork and we thought it was pretty impressive.

(00:53:54):
And so I think that that's probably the biggest secret there. Judge Al Davis once said, "Coach players on what they can do." And I think that's very true. Judge people on what they can do, coach people on what they can do, help them take their strengths and use them as opposed to over focus on their weaknesses and just hand wringing about the one fucking thing they don't know how to do. Because look, everybody's uneven.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:31):
What you're describing, essentially, this is the job of an investor, is to find an underappreciated asset and invest or before something people don't see.

Ben Horowitz (00:54:42):
Venture capital is really about investing in people. You have ideas as an investor, but what you really are ultimately betting on is the entrepreneur and the entrepreneur's idea because the initial idea isn't where they end up usually. It changes a lot with everybody we invest in. So you kind of have to make the judgment on the person. And how you do that is really, really important. And one of the things we emphasize inside the firm is, look, we're investing in strength, not lack of weakness. I want to know how good, are they world-class? Do they have a world-class strength? And can that beat anybody? And look, everybody's flawed. And so let's help them deal with the flaws and surround them with people who can handle that and put the right person on the board who can talk to them.

(00:55:43):
You know Mark's on the board, I go to all his board meetings because I'm the one who's good at killing a guy who's that confident when he's like, "Okay, that's not your best idea." That's good role for me. But that's how you deal with that. You don't throw them away and go, "Oh, okay, we don't want to be called names. So we're not going to invest in Adam Neumann after we built WeWork. That's crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:08):
That's also why you guys invested in Cluely, I imagine similar.

Ben Horowitz (00:56:10):
Yeah, yeah, no, that's right. I mean, look, if you look at what those guys did, that was some high level marketing genius too, and that's really something. Plus the product is awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:23):
I'm going to bring us back to AI. Something that a lot of people are talking about right now while we're recording this is this potential huge bubble we're in with AI. Sam Altman said, "We're in a big bubble," which is, that's saying a lot. I'm curious just how you that it-

Ben Horowitz (00:56:36):
What is it saying? First of all, I should qualify this by saying I am an investor and Sam's a CEO. So CEOs have to have much more purpose when they talk. Investors just have to be entertained. So you got to give Sam credit for what is it in his interest to say it? Well, if it's a bubble, then the one thing you should invest in is him and not all these guys chasing after him.

(00:57:09):
I would say that's very smart. And then the other thing that's smart about it is there's nothing that you can say to the press that will make them love you more than saying, "All investors and entrepreneurs chasing this are idiots." They love them. The press are generally haters, and so it's just red meat for the haters, which was also super clever. So I think whether even he believes that or not, that was a super smart thing to say. So I'll just put it there. Whereas what I'm going to say won't be as smart, but it will...

(00:57:45):
I don't really have an ax to grind here. I mean, I could have an ax to grind and say, "Okay, let's get all the other investors out." I'll say, "It's a massive bubble." But what I would say about that is, so the first thing, the one thing about bubbles is anytime everybody thinks it's a bubble, it's not a bubble because in order for it to bubble, you need capitulation. In that you need everybody to believe it's not a bubble, because then the prices really go out of control. But as long as there's people who think it's a bubble, then it's hard for that to happen. And it's funny, I had this debate in The Economist, I think with Steve Blank in like 2011 or '12 when everybody thought it was a tech bubble, if you can imagine that, which it absolutely was not. But because there were 1,400 articles saying that we were in a tech bubble, and I mean where prices were then compared to where they are now.

(00:58:52):
But I knew because everybody was saying it was a bubble, it wasn't a bubble. I knew that. The prices were higher, but the reason the prices were higher was we're getting to a global market. AI prices are higher than prior prices, but if you look at the revenue growth and numbers, we had not seen anything like it. Sam's product worked so amazingly, we'd never seen that before. Not even Google, not anybody. And so that's real.

(00:59:23):
And we have companies that went from zero to 800 million in a year and that kind of thing. I would say there's a basis for the prices going up, first of all. I think the thing that's right about what Sam is saying is the landscape is early, really early. The technology is very immature. As amazingly as it works, there's a long way to go to improve it. So it's very possible when you have that much technological change, that the positions that these companies have achieved with their high revenue isn't sustainable, and that there'll be a competitive change that either lowers prices or a new number one emerges or that kind of thing.

(01:00:18):
Yeah, that's possible. But I wouldn't characterize that as being a financial bubble in that if you go back to the great dot-com bubble that everybody is always waiting for it to happen again, which I was CEO during. The thing that happened there was very different, which is it was the internet and every smart investor knew that the internet was a big deal. How could you not fucking know that the internet was, of course it's a big deal. But if you go back to 1996, at Netscape, we had 90% browser share and we had 50 million users. So there were 55 million people on the internet in total, and half of those were on dial-up.

(01:01:03):
And then to build a product like Evite, the greeting card company, had 300 engineers. That's how hard it was to build this stuff. And so the math didn't work, and the math didn't work on any of those ideas, but the investors kept pouring money in. And then eventually everybody went bankrupt because there was no revenue coming in. And when they figured that out, then nobody would invest in anything. And of course then everybody realized, well, the internet was actually real and Paul Krugman didn't know what he's talking about, and like it was going to be a big thing. And then Facebook and Google and all these things emerged.

(01:01:44):
But the thing that made it a bubble was the unit economics didn't work, the businesses didn't work. These businesses are all working, and they're being priced appropriately for how they're growing. So that's not in effect. The thing that you could say is, "They're not going to keep growing like that," and so forth. And I'm not sure about that. The products, like I said, are working so much better than any technology product that we've ever built has worked. It's just mind-blowing how good this stuff is. And so, I don't know, if I had to bet, I would bet not a bubble. I think there'll be some dislocation. I think always in venture capital, if you've got a run like this, then the great company and the crap company both get funded. But that's just venture capital. That's not a bubble.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:44):
Four founders starting companies these days. When you look into the future of the AI industry, say in five, 10 years, how do you think things will play out slash where do you think the biggest opportunities remain? Where are you guys looking to invest most?

Ben Horowitz (01:02:57):
In infrastructure. I think that there is obviously a real estate power cooling play. I think that's a little outside of hardcore technology investing that we do. But there's another layer which is take a given open source model, who can run it the cheapest with the lowest latency? And that's going to be extremely valuable, whoever has that. And Google has been historically very good at that and so forth, and Sam is really trying to build that now with Stargate. And so I think that's going to be a very important layer of value. I think that on the foundation model side, you have to be very selective as an investor. So in order to compete in foundational model world, our basic rule of thumb is you have to be able to, without much product progress, raise at least $ 2 billion because that's basically what it's going to cost you to train something that gets you competitive enough to make money.

(01:04:08):
And there are just very few founders like that. So Ilya is one of those. Mary's one of those, Fei-Fei is one of those, but that's the kind of class of person you need. And there's whatever. There's certainly less than 10 of those in the world. And so that's kind of an important area, but a small area. And then I think the application layer is going to be very, very interesting. And I think that if you look at Sam, he's making most of his money off ChatGPT, almost all his money off ChatGPT now. And Chat GPT, like it or not, it's got a real moat. It's very hard to knock it off. It's perched.

(01:04:57):
Everybody's taking a shot at it, people, great distribution like Google and Elon and Zuckerberg and everybody. And that thing just keeps going like it is. So I think the applications are both more complex and kind of stickier than people thought they were originally. The thing that people got very wrong is this whole thin wrapper around GPT, that's really wrong. In fact, here's how wrong it is. Back in the '80s, that same phrase was used, but it was thin wrapper around an RDBMS-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):
Database.

Ben Horowitz (01:05:39):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it meant companies like Salesforce were basically just a thin wrapper. And I think that that's kind of the mistake people made. So we're at this company Cursor, and if you look under the covers in Cursor, they've built 14 different models to really understand how a developer works, a high-end, a real developer. Those models have tons and tons of interactions with how people talk to their friend Cursor about how they should design their programming so forth. And that's real, that's not just a thin layer on a foundation model. And I think there are many, many applications like that. And so I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity at the application layer. There's going to be some opportunity at the foundation model, and of course you can invest in Sam, you can invest in Anthropic and so forth as well.

(01:06:43):
But there will probably be a very small number of companies at that set, and then a almost unlimited number of companies at the application layer. And then as the technology advances, we'll of course see more things we can body to AI. I mean already autonomous cars are working really well now after a long, long, long, long time. Since I think Sebastian won the challenge in 2006 when he drove the self-driving car across the country. And here we are 20 years later and now they're deployed. So that was a long time. Robots I think is a harder problem than self-driving cars. So we'll see how that goes. But, yeah, there's certainly a lot in that world as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):
Wow, okay. There's a lot to this answer. No, that was exactly what I was looking for. The Cursor example, it's something that comes up a lot on this podcast, in the application layer specifically. The thought that the way to win in this space and to build a moat is, as you said, "Build your own model slash have proprietary data that you build through people using your product." Thoughts on that?

Ben Horowitz (01:07:58):
Yeah, I mean, I think that ends up just being what's required. So it turns out that the universe is long-tailed, is fat-tailed, and humans are very fat-tailed in terms of human behavior, human conversation and so forth. So to get to the real meaning of it and to get to the kind of essence of the problem, in any domain turns out to be, I think, more complex than we thought. And so the early things and people were running around saying, "Okay, there's going to be one big brain to rule them all on these kinds of things." That's kind of not played out yet.

(01:08:41):
And in fact, if you look underneath the covers, you have LLMs, which have generalized pretty in fascinating ways, but they've kind of also asymptoted in that we have run out of data for the most part. And so if you look at the GPT-5 LLM compared to the GPT-4.1 and how much more it costs to train and so forth, it's definitely not going linear anymore.

(01:09:12):
On the other hand, the reinforcement learning side has been linear, but it doesn't generalize. So if you build a great programming model, it may be an idiot at math. And so that I think is just very different than what people would've said three years ago. And I think that there's not something that's both scaling and generalizing yet, and maybe we'll get there, but that certainly opens the door to something that's more user-friendly, that's more effective in any number of domains than just the basic foundation model infrastructure. Now those models are incredibly important, and I think OpenAI is probably 80% of the revenue in AI are something like that now. It's massive, and so that foundation model is really, really important. And then the basic consumer app is really, really important.

(01:10:12):
That just answers whatever the hell you want to know. Those things are very, very real. But I do think particularly, and then if you get into enterprise stuff and then it's no longer internet data, it's their data that becomes very different. Databricks is having a lot of success there because, okay, well, once you're inside a company, guess what? You care about access control. That's hard with an AI world. It gets trained on some stuff. How does it know who has access to that information and who doesn't, and so forth. You have semantic issues. So if you look at an enterprise, find 10 enterprises, they all have a different definition of what a customer means. You would think customer is a basic thing. Well, is it a department at AT&T? Is it AT&T? Is it a person at AT&T? What the hell is the customer? And it turns out to be very, very meaningful, particularly if you're trying to figure out important things like churn and this and that and third.

(01:11:19):
So that kind of stuff matters. So I would just say the problem space is a lot bigger than you can just attack with a basic foundation model currently. Maybe that will change, and if that changes, then certain prices will have, in retrospect, look way inflated and others will look too low. But that is TBD.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:48):
So a big takeaway from this is that there's still tons of opportunity for founders to start companies building AI products.

Ben Horowitz (01:11:55):
I think so. Everything that we couldn't solve with software we can solve now, almost. So it's a really big world. And it's funny because we're investors in Waymo, and one of the things when you get into what took so long to make Waymo so safe like they are now, it wasn't the things that everybody reported on the podcast. There wasn't sleet and heavy rain, it was people. It was like the human who was driving 75 in the 25 zone. It was very hard for the AI to anticipate because it was rare but important. And the number of rare, important crazy shit that humans do is very high. And I think that that goes for all of AI. So to make things work really well, you have to understand this very kind of fat tail of human behavior.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:52):
Along this AI thread, something that is really important to you, clearly something you talk a lot about is the US being successful in AI, in leading the world in AI. Why is this so important? Why is something you spend a lot of time on?

Ben Horowitz (01:13:06):
It starts with, I think, my view of the US and its role in the world. My personal view is it's very, very, very important. Not for society to be completely fair because it's not going to be completely fair or completely equal because we've never had one that's been completely equal. But it's important that everybody have a chance at life, and particularly both culturally, but also just you can't advance the world if you can't tap into all of your resources. And so if you kind of take away motivation and these kinds of things, you get into trouble. And if you look at the kind of every country today, and this is by the way, so you want the right amount of decentralized power. You don't want it to be completely concentrated, concentrated power makes it very, very difficult for everybody to have a chance. This is the big lesson of communism over the last hundred years is it turned out right. And we still have politicians selling it this way today, it's like, "Oh, it's power to the people."

(01:14:23):
No, no, no. It's power to you because you're removing all power from the private sector and installing it into the government, and then you're putting yourself in charge of the government. And so I become extremely powerful. And this is why it didn't matter if it was Mao or Pol Pot or Ceausescu or Stalin, everybody died because when you give anybody that much power, nobody has a chance. There is no incentive, there's no carrot, there's only stick. And so you use that stick, and that's just the nature. It's a system's problem. It's not a person problem. It's not Stalin was evil, Ceausescu is evil. It was that system is evil. And-

Ben Horowitz (01:15:00):
It was evil. It was like that system is evil. And that's the saying with fascism. Be it Hitler or Mussolini, it doesn't matter. That level of power is evil.

(01:15:11):
And the US does the best job. Systematically, it's the best system. It's got all kinds of issues, it's got problems. People always try to defeat it. But one of the things that if you look at the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution, the language is very important. It's, "We hold these truths to be self-evident."

(01:15:39):
What does that mean? It means it's not my rule, it's not the president's rule, it's God's rule. And so those rules are above the President, and then you work in that context and that distributes the power, because you're under the law, not under the person. We see that now even with Europe, where the leaders are going, "Well, I have a rule. It's you can't say certain things or I'll throw you in jail." And the kind of shield they hide behind as well, we have to keep the kids safe. But if you say something that I don't agree with and the kids hear it, they're not safe. So the kind of transited property of bullshit is going to override.

(01:16:29):
And so it's really important that we have at least one society. And as flawed as we are, as flawed as the US is, it's still the best. And you can see it by the number of new company creations, the number of new ideas that come out of here and so forth. It's really, really important that the US stays important and powerful in the world.

(01:16:51):
We know from the last century, if you look at the last century, who were the countries that had economic power, military power, cultural power? They were the ones that industrialized, and the ones that industrialized first and best. And the ones that did became Communists, like Russia, China. They were slow on industrialization and they fell into this very fucking dangerous system.

(01:17:19):
Looking forward, that's going to happen again, but it's going to be AI. And so it is fundamentally important, not just to America, but to humanity, that America succeed at that. We don't have to be the one winner or this or that, but we do have to be in that tier.

(01:17:41):
And as I go around the world and travel, I can't tell you, everybody ... and then everybody was getting, by the way, very, very worried about us earlier. And they say, "Look, we need you to succeed. Don't destroy the dollar. Don't fall behind in AI. Don't over-regulate it too early. Don't do these things, please, because we need you to win, because we're all counting on that."

(01:18:08):
And I think it's the most important work that we do. It's why we're so involved in policy and so forth. I think this is also going to be very, very true with crypto, which ends up being an incredibly important networking technology that complements AI. That work is, I would say, beyond for the money. Although we will end up making a lot of money with the right policies, so I don't want to seem totally philanthropic on this, but it's more important than that. It's certainly more important than us succeeding or anything like that, that the country succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:53):
Speaking of philanthropic and other passions of yours, something that I don't think most people know about you, and I think will give them another insight into how interesting you are, you run an organization called Paid in Full, which is incredibly cool. Talk about what that's about, why this is so important to you.

Ben Horowitz (01:19:14):
Our ethos as a firm is kind of what I'd say is something from nothing. This is the greatness of entrepreneurship. You start with nothing and then you make something really important. That is also how Hip-hop started, where you have a bunch of kids who didn't even have instruments, and they created something out of nothing. And the people in that world always talk about that.

(01:19:43):
And one of the really unfortunate things that happens is, the people who invent the art form, and certainly in the case of Hip-hop, don't get anywhere near the kind of proportional benefit of their invention. And a lot of the guys, people have forgotten about, or are struggling to make ends meet, and so forth.

(01:20:06):
So what we created was this thing called the Paid in Full Foundation, named after the Rakim, Eric B. song, which I did call Rakim and ask him for permission to use the name, so we didn't just take it. What we do is, we give essentially pensions to the old rappers, that enable them to kind of continue their work.

(01:20:28):
And then we have a big event go to paidinfullfoundation.org for tickets, which is amazing, where they get the award and they're celebrated by all their peers and so forth. And it's really phenomenal. Some of the awardees have been Rakim, Scarface from the Geto Boys, Roxanne Shante, Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee.

(01:20:56):
This year we're honoring George Clinton for being sampled, Kool G Rap and Grand Puba, and also Jalil from Whodini. I can't even describe how high impact it is on these guys. I think Rakim was touring close to 200 nights a year, and he got his award, and came out with his first album in 15 years and is doing amazingly well. All of a sudden everybody's going, "Oh yeah, that's the greatest rapper of all time." They're finally going back and remembering all the things he did. Roxanne Shante, nobody had mentioned her in years and years and years. I think six months after we gave her the award, the Grammys gave her a lifetime achievement award, which is amazing. It's super high impact. It's a great thing. As a Hip-hop fan, I say dream come true. It's my only guilt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):
What's the origin story of you and Hip-hop? I imagine many people look at you and wouldn't imagine these records behind you, Nas gifted you. You are so deep into the community, just how did this all begin?

Ben Horowitz (01:22:03):
Well, I actually wrote a blog post on it called The Legend of the Blind MC, which I think would be, if you're really interested, it's worth reading. But it is kind of a story of me becoming a rapper, and how that occurred, and how it went, and so forth.

(01:22:23):
I always say the very short story is, I was in New York at the birth of Hip-hop and when it really became big, '84 through '88. It's just the most exciting thing to see a new art form pop out and the creativity and everything.

(01:22:43):
Once music becomes mainstream, I would say it's very shaped by business. And in the early days, everybody's just coming out with whatever idea they have and so forth. The early days of rock and roll were like that. The early days of jazz were like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:02):
I see now even more why you guys brought on Erik Torenberg. Beyond his many talents, he's also really big into rap himself.

Ben Horowitz (01:23:10):
Yeah, that's a good reminder. I need to make sure he gets to Paid in Full.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):
Ben, this was incredible. Is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with or share before we get to our very exciting, quick lightning round?

Ben Horowitz (01:23:28):
Yeah, I would just say, if you're a CEO listening to this, then know that how you feel about yourself is going to end up meaning as much as anything, and take your time on that. Self-evaluation is ... one of my favorite quotes is that when my old manager saw me, as select players know, "From this day on, no credit will be given for predicting rain, only credit for building an ark."

(01:24:05):
And I think that's more true for CEOs than anybody. You have to build the ark. It doesn't matter if you predict you're going to fail, you've still failed. It gets you nothing. So what you have to do is figure your way out of it and spend all your time on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:23):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Ben Horowitz (01:24:27):
Yes, sir.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:29):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people, not including your own books?

Ben Horowitz (01:24:35):
So two that I learned a lot from, one is The Weirdest People in the World, which it's a kind of big history book, but through an anthropological kind of cultural lens. It's really fascinating. It explains an awful lot about how society works and how little changes in the rules completely change the culture.

(01:25:02):
One of the things that he basically endeavors to explain, why did the West get ahead on the rest of the world? It kind of comes down to a weird anomaly with the Catholic Church, where they enforced monogamous marriage. And it turns out that the natural state of humans is polygamy, but the problem with polygamy is, there's no cooperation among men, which is a problem. And as a result, and then everything is secret, so there's no sharing of knowledge, because it's all kept in the family, in what he calls kin-based culture.

(01:25:44):
It leads to something called kin-based culture. And even recipes won't be shared if you're in a kin-based culture, because it's a secret. So you can't build science, you can't build cities, you can't build big companies. So because the West kind of enforced broad monogamous marriage early, it was able to evolve into all these things.

(01:26:07):
And he kind of shows why and how. He does these psychological tests today with people from monogamous marriage culture, Western culture, and kin-based culture. And the psychology is completely different. He gives examples like if a person murders another person, is that still murder if that person who did the murder is your brother? And in Western society, yeah, that's a murder. In kin-based culture, it's not a murder. It's just not.

(01:26:39):
And so that's really different. And so morality is different, everything comes off of that. So it's just a fascinating, fascinating book. So that's one.

(01:26:55):
Another book that I recommend a lot is Shaka's book, his first book, Writing My Wrongs. He has a new book that I think is better, which is called How to Be Free. It's not quite out, or maybe it's releasing. It's releasing next month, so I recommend it.

(01:27:11):
What it does is, it goes through how did he work his way out of prison and solitary confinement to his current psychology, and what are the techniques he used? They're very powerful, very powerful ideas. CEOs always asks me, "How do you deal with it? How do you deal with it?" They'll ask in a work-life balance. It's like, "What are you talking about? No work-life balance for CEOs," or particularly entrepreneur CEOs, come on.

(01:27:43):
But what do you do? Do you meditate? Do you do this or that? But he kind of goes through the things that you really ought to do. That's what I would recommend, if somebody's wondering, how do you deal with all this pressure?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:57):
I love this. Just the whole idea of Shaka being this help for CEOs, someone that killed someone, went to prison, led a prison gang. I just love that, how valuable his lessons-

Ben Horowitz (01:28:08):
Prison gangs turn out to be really complicated things to manage. Sorry for getting into this, but the problem with running a prison gang is, you're just dealing with people who all come from broken culture.

(01:28:23):
So in any organization, like the fundamental thing is trust. And so you're bringing in a bunch of no trust people. And so again, it's kind of like a military organization. It's a gang. If you think about a military operation, if you don't have trust, people don't trust the order, then you're completely dysfunctional.

(01:28:46):
So how do you build trust from zero is a very interesting problem. And he's a genius at that, by the way. And I learned a lot from talking to him about it. So from a management standpoint, I would just say it's an important kind of boundary case of how you build culture. He is very, very smart at that. Like I said, you have to look at people about their greatness, not the worst thing they ever did.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:23):
I know it's the lightning round, but can you just share one example of something he did that was like, wow, that's a really good lesson, someone trying to create a good culture that worked for him?

Ben Horowitz (01:29:32):
Yeah. So one of the things that he did that I thought was really smart is ... Well, he did a couple of things. One is just a simple thing. He just made everybody eat lunch together in the gang, just to build rapport, relationship, trust, like it's all one thing. We're all together on that.

(01:29:56):
And I think particularly in the remote work world and so forth, people really underestimate how powerful just that idea can be. And then another thing he did is, he made morality ... he had very specific things about, you had to be good to your word internally and externally.

(01:30:26):
So normally a gang, like I said, it's kind of a kin-based culture thing. But it made it much more powerful when he said, "Look, you can't do devious shit outside the gang either." And he had a bunch of examples of that, that I went through in the book.

(01:30:50):
Like I said, because you're building it from zero, you really have to take a hard line on things that I think people in companies don't even take a hard line on. Is it okay to lie internally? Probably not. Is it okay to lie to a customer? Well, in some organizations it is, but in Shaka's organization, that's as big a penalty as lying internally. These things, I think, end up being really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:15):
We're going to link to this book. This is, What You Do is Who You Are. This is your second book that fewer people know about. And this is one of the stories you tell and just what the lessons are for building-

Ben Horowitz (01:31:23):
Yeah. It's kind of the more advanced book. You kind of have to survive to want to care about dealing with the cultural issues. And so the survival book has a bigger audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:36):
Amazing. We're going to keep going with Lightning Round. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you have really enjoyed?

Ben Horowitz (01:31:42):
Well on TV, I really like Slow Horses, which is the show about the MI6 cast-off guys. And then I haven't seen a lot of movies lately, but I watched Sinners. I went to theater for Sinners. Just the cinematography is unbelievable, and the story is really original, and the acting is incredible, and the costumes are amazing. It's just a great, comprehensive piece of work. The craftsmanship on that thing is just a lot beyond what most people making movies are doing these days, so I really enjoyed that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:24):
I hate scary movies, but I watched it and loved it.

Ben Horowitz (01:32:27):
It wasn't that scary.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:29):
It wasn't that scary, but still, it was zombies popping out of corners. That's not my jam usually.

(01:32:35):
Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love? It could be a gadget, it could be clothes, could be something else.

Ben Horowitz (01:32:40):
I bought a coffee machine called the Technivorm Moccamaster, which is freaking incredible. In fact, a friend of mine saw it and was like, "What is that?" And I just bought it for him too, because it's so awesome. This thing makes coffee that it's just perfect. There's no bitterness. It's completely clean. It's amazing. The only problem with it is, I can't drink coffee that it doesn't make anymore. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing, but ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:13):
That might come out someday in the AI future.

Ben Horowitz (01:33:16):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:17):
Two more questions. One, is there a life motto that you often come back to, find really useful in work or in life?

Ben Horowitz (01:33:24):
The thing that I would say has had the biggest effect on me is something my father said to me years ago, which is, "Life isn't fair." That seems really, really simple, but I think that the thing that defeats people more than any other thing that I've seen, just in life, is the expectation of some fairness. It's just not fair.

(01:33:54):
There are all kinds of stuff that are going to happen to you, and happen to everybody, that don't happen to other people, that are completely unfair. But it doesn't matter, because that's the way it is. As soon as you get that idea out of your mind, then you can just deal with it, like, oh yeah, of course it's not fair, but what should I do now, which is the real question, not how do I go back and get people to be fair? Nobody's going to be fair. It's not fair.

(01:34:25):
It's the nature of it. If you think about it for more than five seconds, you'll realize that. It's as an individual, if you want to make the world a better place, whatever, but as an individual, do not expect anything to be fair, it'll only defeat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:43):
Final question. This comes from Shaka, actually. He gave me so many great suggestions. I hate to save this one for last. So the question is, if you had to build a business curriculum from two Hip-hop albums and one Funk album, what would they be and why?

Ben Horowitz (01:34:58):
I think probably Follow the Leader by Rakim. And the reason is what we had kind of gotten into earlier, which is leadership. When he came out with that song, which was maybe the greatest Hip-hop song ever written, he's telling people to follow him, follow the leader. And just to have the idea that he was the leader of the entire art form, not just his band, it is amazing idea. And then the way he expressed it was incredible. And then he's got other great concepts in there that would give you ... It's hard to listen to that record and not have confidence.

(01:36:02):
I think from a competitive, purely competitive standpoint, Stillmatic from Nas, that's the one with Get Ur Self a Gun, that's the one with You're da Man. It's like all of the idea of competition is encapsulated in that album, so that would be the other one.

(01:36:26):
And then Funk, One Nation Under a Groove, for sure. Because it's like, how do you initiate people into a concept or an idea, and how do you infuse them? One Nation Under a Groove is all about joining the nation, and it's so musically interesting and getting people to be part of that. [inaudible 01:36:58] If you asked me tomorrow, I'd probably have three other ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:03):
Incredible. I'm going to go listen to these. Ben, final question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Ben Horowitz (01:37:07):
If you get something that makes you better, please take it. If you need more advice on it, let me know. Look, my job is to help everybody build something great, so if you're an entrepreneur, thank you for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:22):
Also, check out Paid in Full, paidinfullfoundation.org, if you want to learn more about that nonprofit.

Ben Horowitz (01:37:26):
Yes, definitely, we would love to have you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:29):
Amazing. Ben, thank you so much for being here.

# How marketplaces win: Liquidity, growth levers, quality, more | Benjamin Lauzier (Lyft, Thumbtack)

## Transcript

Benjamin Lauzier (00:00:00):
I think when you're running a marketplace, you tend to sit in your ivory tower a little bit, looking at stats and thinking like, "If only we could get people to do X, it'd be better for everyone." I certainly did that in my career. I think that's missing the point that we're humans, and I think sometimes we act in ways that are non-deterministic or counterintuitive. But my take is I'm a huge believer in market forces and empowerment, so provide guardrails for what a good experience is in your marketplace, set a clear bar for quality, and provide the right coaching and tools for supply to be successful, and then take a step back and see where the gaps are and invest more in hands-on tactics just to close those gaps more specifically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
Today my guest is Ben Lauzier. Ben was VP of product and growth at Thumbtack, where he rebuilt the product team and Thumbtack's growth strategy, re-architected the revenue model, and helped 3X Thumbtack's growth within three years. Prior to Thumbtack, Ben was at Lyft for over six years, where he was employee number 30 and led product and growth for the driver's side of the business, and at one point reached 1% of U.S. workers driving for Lyft every month. He currently spends his time advising marketplace teams and founders, teaching a reforged course on marketplace growth, and most recently started a healthcare company called Nurra that connects you to a care advocate to help you navigate the healthcare system in the U.S. In our conversation, we go many layers deep on the many key elements of building and scaling a marketplace business, including what to focus on pre-product market fit, how to know which side of the marketplace to prioritize, what product market fit looks like, how to track liquidity, what causes most marketplaces to fail and how to avoid that.

(00:01:43):
And a bunch of examples of really clever growth strategies, especially on the supply side, and some really interesting stories about how Lyft was able to compete with Uber early on with one-tenth of the resources. As a bonus, Ben also shares insights into how the European product market is different from the U.S. product market, and what he encourages European companies to change in order to operate more effectively and be more innovative. This episode is for anyone building or thinking about building a marketplace business.

Ben, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:02:29):
Thank you so much, so good to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:32):
It's absolutely my pleasure. Okay, so you are one of the most knowledgeable and experienced product leaders in the world on building and scaling a marketplace company, and so I want to spend the bulk of our time talking about and essentially extracting as much wisdom out of your brain on how to build and scale a marketplace business so that founders and teams that are struggling with building their marketplace company, or just thinking about building a marketplace business, can save a lot of time and a lot of pain. How does that sound to you?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:03:03):
That sounds amazing. That's a high bar, but I will try to live up to your expectations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:08):
I'm confident we will hit that bar. Let me start with just setting a little context, and for folks that aren't super familiar with what is a marketplace business, they hear this term marketplace company, what's the simplest way to understand what makes a company a marketplace company and a marketplace business?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:03:24):
I mean, like you mentioned, I love marketplaces. I think I've been building and scaling marketplaces for I think almost 15 years now, and I feel like they add just such a fascinating dimension to the challenge that we work on as PMs, and it's this hidden dimension that you uncover when you work on marketplaces. And I think on paper what makes a marketplace is pretty straightforward, it's two or more sides that are distinct from one another, and they provide value to each other, and then you have an intermediary trying to facilitate that exchange of value in the middle. So, that's pretty simple explanation. I think in practice it's always a little bit more nuanced on the fringes. You have all those interesting dimensions, like how involved is the intermediary defines how managed the marketplace is. So, something like Craigslist is super hands-off, unmanaged, and something like Lyft starts to be more into the semi-managed where the platform significantly shapes the transaction in this exchange of value. So, I think that's how I see it, but there's all those fascinating variations of marketplaces, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:25):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth, and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more, with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, an accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. 

(00:05:18):

(00:06:52):
You've mentioned managed marketplaces and just how that becomes something marketplaces start to think about more, I want to get back to that because a really important point. But just to even clarify this point, a key part of a marketplace is that the company doesn't own the supply. That's in a sense what defines their marketplace versus they're just selling stuff.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:07:12):
Totally. Yes, yes. And I think again, you have companies that claim to be managed marketplaces, I think depending on how you want to look, with investors perhaps, you'll pick one angle or the other, but that's where you get into gray waters. But yeah, the marketplace implies this concept of two independent and supposedly autonomous parties that you help connect and provide this exchange of value for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:40):
Awesome. Okay, so let's come back to that, because that's a really important topic and it's something that every marketplace trends towards or thinks about is just like we're going to control the supply, we're going to manage it, we're going to maybe own it in the future, but let's get back to that. So, you work with a ton of marketplaces, you've built a bunch of marketplaces. What do you find is the biggest struggle to building a successful marketplace business? The most common problem people run into.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:08:05):
I think there's two types of challenges, I guess there's when you're talking about creating a marketplace, and then there's when you're talking about scaling a marketplace. For creating a marketplace, I see many founders that are pre-product market fit, super eager to nerd out on marketplace dynamics. They're super excited to launch a marketplace, we all are, and they want to talk about supply and demand, they want to look at all kinds of ratios. They show me economic papers and ask, "How could we apply this principle to my company?" And here, my advice is generally always, "If you don't have product market fit, and if you don't have a good enough growth strategy for at least one side of your marketplace, just forget about all this marketplace stuff."

(00:08:46):
Focus on this core exchange of value, go deep with one side of the marketplace and see if you can rely on some crutch, some hack for the other side for time being. And you see companies like Airbnb and Thumbtack doing this with Craigslist pretty early on to jumpstart their growth as just countless examples, but don't get distracted by this shiny and cool intellectually challenging idea of working on the marketplace, and nail the basics of your product market fit at first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:13):
So, just to spend a little more time there to make this even more real. So, you're saying that pre-product market fit, before you find that anyone really wants what you're building, focus on figuring out a way to grow one side of the marketplace. So, maybe just two quick follow up questions. How do you know which side to focus on initially? And can you give an example, I think Thumbtack may be a good example of this, of how they did that?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:09:38):
Which side to focus on is there's different approaches to this, but generally people will pick the hardest side. And so, I'll take the example of Thumbtack, because we're going to talk about it. So, Thumbtack is a home services marketplace to help you find plumbers, electricians, and the harder side there was demand. There's supply, and you can look for, you can open the yellow pages, you can find plumbers somewhere, but the hardest question was can we go out there and can we find people who want to do something in their house, who have projects that need to be done? What is the core growth strategy for us to acquire those people, to find them? And what kind of retention can we create? Can we create a delightful experience for them to come back to our platform and want us to take care of their home for them?

(00:10:32):
Pick the hardest side is my advice. And then, how some companies do this, again, I think there's a lot of different ways to do this, but a common advice is find a way to jumpstart one side. Find a way to hack one side, play one player mode is what it's also called sometimes, but try to find a way to tap into existing channels that have one side of your marketplace already latent. And so again, you have countless businesses that if you've been built off of Craigslist, I think Thumbtack was partially one of them, and the idea was like, "Hey, we can find all those great pros on Thumbtack. When we have someone who wants a job, 'Oh, you want your kitchen remodeled?' We can, behind the scenes, go and post a job on Craigslist and then we'll bring on all the contractors who are browsing Craigslist looking for jobs, we'll bring them to our platform." 

(00:11:26):
That's an example of how that you worry about the core value proposition of can we get people to come back to the platform? Can we create this delightful exchange of value? Are people trusting us? Do we have the right checks in place to make sure that you are hiring the right person? What will make you come back? And once that's done, then you can focus around how do I build a flywheel on the supply side, and how do I manage and how do I make sure I have enough plumbers per market, or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:53):
When you say find the hard side, how do you find that? Any advice you can give founders and teams?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:11:58):
In general, I would say intuitively the teams know, especially the teams are in the weeds, they know. They know, "Well, yeah, we can get X. But what we really struggle with is getting students to look at this." That's your sign. And I think sometimes it takes someone else to make you think about it, to reflect like, "Actually, yes, you're right. This side is obvious. We know how to get it, we just don't have the right supply for it and we don't know where to find the supply." Boom, that's the side that you should be focused on. Then you find a way to add source to demand, subsidize it, find some other way, and focus on this side that you have no idea how to grow. You should have a reliable growth strategy for the side.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):
In my experience, it's almost always the supply side is what you need to work on, because once you have awesome supply, people are going to be really excited to tap it. Like Uber drivers, Airbnb homes, professionals on Thumbtack. Is that your experience too?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:12:54):
Yes. I would say supply is the hardest side maybe like 80% to 90% of the time. Yeah, I totally agree. I was trying to think of counter examples, but I can't think of one. I just know that there are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:05):
There's one I know, which is Rover, based on research I did, because it turned out it was really easy to find people who want to walk dogs and watch dogs for 50 bucks an hour or whatever. It was a very easy value prop, and so they had a waitlist, they had just so many people. Also, TaskRabbit is the one I know about where they had so many people wanting to be taskers, whatever they call them-

Benjamin Lauzier (00:13:24):
I was going to mention TaskRabbit as well. I heard of that as well, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:27):
Okay. And then you talked about there's a core part of figuring out how to grow that part, how to grow the hard part, generally the supply side. You shared a couple examples. Are there any more clever things you recall that you might be able to share of just ways people grew supply early on that could inspire people that are trying to figure this out right now?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:13:46):
Yeah, I think there's a couple of common tactics I would say pretty early on that I think companies rely on. So, we've talked about jump-starting one side of the marketplace with, it may be with Thumbtack and Lyft, also leverage job boards. You have also a lot of companies building value added services pretty early on as a core way of retaining supply pretty early on. Like let's build a really compelling basket of value for this supply, and this is going to be the thing that appeals everyone. So, OpenTable did this really well with all the restaurant services, other things that I've seen people use really well early on or converting your supply into demand or demand into supply pretty early on, so Lyft, we tried that. It actually didn't work at Lyft, but I know other marketplaces have been pretty successful with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):
Just to make sure people understand that one, it's a really interesting one is, in the Lyft example would be convincing drivers to become riders, convincing riders to become drivers, and mostly the latter, convincing riders to become drivers.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:14:55):
Yeah, exactly. In our case at Lyft early on, we had a waitlist on the demand side because we just couldn't onboard enough supply. And so, we had this idea of having a pop-up. Instead of saying no drivers available, it would be like, "Hey, sorry, all the drivers are taken. People are making 50 bucks an hour right now, do you want to hop on your car and drive?" And we had some conversions, but it felt a little distracting to the overall experience and it wasn't a huge driver of supply. But I know that for Uber it actually was. I think they had a relatively meaningful amount of supply coming from [inaudible 00:15:27]

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:27):
Wow, how does that make you feel that Uber figured out a better way to approach this and made it work? That doesn't feel-

Benjamin Lauzier (00:15:33):
And it's a different audience. You would think that the Lyft passenger and driver is more likely to flip back and forth between the two. I don't know, I don't know. [inaudible 00:15:47]

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:46):
Yeah, a PM at Uber outdid you guys. Oh, no. 

Benjamin Lauzier (00:15:50):
Yes, on a couple of other things. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:52):
Interesting. 

Benjamin Lauzier (00:15:52):
And we outdid them on a few other things [inaudible 00:15:55]

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:54):
Okay, okay. That's right. So, essentially what we've been spending some time on here is just when you're starting a marketplace, figure out which side you need to drive, because that's what will unlock this opportunity. There's a hard thing that nobody's ever done before, and most of the time it's build a bunch of supply that nobody has done before, and there's all these tactics to do that. And all of this is, as you coming back to the main question I asked, we've gone on this awesome tangent, is pre-product market fit before you even know this is a thing. Spend time most of the time building supply to see if demand, customers actually want this thing. Right?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:16:34):
Exactly. And then I think there's a different set of challenges. The other pitfall that I see is, so pre-product market fit, people tend to be distracted by those marketplace dynamics like we talked about instead of doing what we just talked about. For companies that have some sort of scale and product market fit, to me the place where I see people getting tripped up most often is the concept of marketplace liquidity or how to match the health of a marketplace. To me, liquidity is how marketplaces win. It's this measure of your ability to match buyers and sellers efficiently, it's how quickly and efficiently people can find what they're looking for on your platform. So, you can picture a Venn diagram. One circle is this is what supply wants to sell, and another circle is this is what demand wants to buy, and your liquidity is the overlap between those two circles.

(00:17:26):
So for, let's take the example of Lyft or Uber, because we talked about them. It might be for all the people who open the app with the intention to book a ride, how many of those actually turn into a ride? And this metric liquidity, it's a direct multiplier on the efficiency of your marketplace. It's literally at the center of your vision, it's why you exist as a marketplace is to connect the two. And it's also the ultimate engagement loop. The more supply you have, the more choice people have, the better the services, the more likely it is that it turns into a transaction and the more likely it is that they come back. And so, it's really this incredible circle. And what I see is people missing how critical this component is in the marketplace, struggle to define it for the business, and most importantly struggle to build an actionable playbook against it. Like, "Okay, how do I manage this? Okay, it's important, but what do I do about it?" Basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:21):
Is there a metric you recommend people specifically look at to understand liquidity?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:18:26):
I think the metric that I like the most is a predictor of liquidity. So your liquidity might be, it's typically a measure of demand utilization. It might be looking for something on there, maybe how many of those searches with intent actually turn into a transaction. So, it's your field rate of your intentful demand typically, and that's really indicative of the net output of your marketplace. And so, that gives you a sense of the health of your marketplace, but it can be influenced by a whole bunch of different factors. So, if you think about for Thumbtack, it can be influenced by if there's a snowstorm out there, if the competition is bidding, there's a whole bunch of exogenous factors that come into play. And the metric that I think is slightly more actionable is a little harder to define, but so much more helpful in my opinion.

(00:19:19):
It's what I call a market health metric, and this is basically think of your proxy that is the best predictor of your liquidity. So, I'll use the example of Lyft. You have your liquidity is your demand utilization, it's how many app opens turn into a ride, and what predicts this? What will predict you and deciding to book a ride? For Lyft and for Uber, it was ETAs. So, we knew that if the closest driver was at least two minutes away from you or closer, then we had hit a ceiling, you were more than X person likely to convert and book a ride. If it's more than two minutes, if it's five, then maybe you check at Uber, maybe you walk, maybe you take the bus. If it's two minutes, it doesn't make a big enough difference, you're just going to book the ride anyway.

(00:20:06):
So find this threshold, find this predictor that tends to plateau that correlates strongly with retention but with also the transaction happening, and that's the metric that you can predict. That's a metric that's so much more actionable for teams to work against. If you're a supply team now you can think of, "Okay, I'm adding 100 supplies into the platform. I want to know if it's actually reducing ETAs in this case," or I can look at correlations like this and limiting some of the effect of those exhaustive factors that I mentioned.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:38):
Awesome. So, essentially watch fill rate is the term used that a lot of people love, which is just people with intent converting. So, the Airbnb example is exactly the way we did Airbnb is we looked at people that are searching with dates as intentful users, and then how many of them convert to a booking. So, that's basically what you're trying to get to, and your point here is that's kind of the output metric. That's what you want to move, but in order to move it, there's something that is the biggest lever to moving fill rate. And in your experience, and I've seen this exact same thing, it's usually amount of supply. Do you have enough good supply? And so, in the case of Lyft is do you have enough cars? Do you have enough homes, do you have enough plumbers on Thumbtack? And that's usually where you can actually impact fill rate. Sweet. 

Benjamin Lauzier (00:21:25):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:26):
And that becomes the goal of the team, that becomes the focus of the company, basically drive that up in all the little markets you're in and all the categories you're in.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:21:34):
Exactly. Yeah, completely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):
Awesome. You mentioned this idea of product market fit and the things change, pre-product market fit, post-product market fit. Classic question, I'm curious if you have any insights here, just what tells you that you've climbed that hill of product market fit, that you might have product market fit, or you definitely have product market fit in a marketplace?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:21:55):
It's hard because to me, the two are most independent. Maybe this is a hot take, but I feel like product market fit is independent of your marketplace dynamics. You might have a great product, and it provides amazing value to both sides, but you have yet to crack the flywheel on the supply side for how to bring those people. You don't have the right product channel fit, for example. And so, this will have a massive impact on the dynamics of your marketplace. And so, to me, my answer would tend to be pretty classical, it would be like measure your product market fit the way you would for a normal company. So yeah, it's a bit of an art more than the science, but I like the classic if we were to take this product away, what percentage of users would be significantly disappointed or have no other solution?

(00:22:50):
So, questions like this I think go to the heart of how valuable is your solution to users, and you can do this on the supply side and the demand side. I think here my advice is typically to consider that you have two product market fits essentially. You want to make sure that you have a compelling enough value proposition on both sides of the marketplace, and very often at the beginning you find product market fit on the demand side, but you realize it's not compelling enough for your suppliers because your margins are too high or something like that. So, realizing that you have both those things, but I think you can measure them in a way that's relatively traditional, and that's independent of marketplace dynamics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:27):
I love that. We actually just had Sean Ellis on the podcast talking about that exact survey, the Sean Ellis test of asking people how disappointed would you be if they left, if the product didn't exist. And I just love that you keep coming back to this point that I 100% agree with, that most of the challenges you have with a marketplace business, 90% are the same challenges you'll have with a non-marketplace business. And people over-focus on, "Oh, I need to think of this like a marketplace, and all the marketplace science behind all this stuff." And really it's all the same stuff every founder is dealing with product market fit, except you have two sides of it growth strategy, but you have two sides of it. So, I love that you keep going back to that. 

(00:24:10):
Something that I definitely want to touch on is when people are thinking about starting a marketplace company, what are signals that a marketplace is a good model for the idea? Because I think a lot of people come into and be like, "I want to build a marketplace. Oh, I'm going to connect these two sides. It's going to be great," and there's no marketplace in this business, in this vertical. What are signs that marketplace dynamic and a business model is right for an idea versus no, it's not?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:24:40):
No one ever say like, "Oh, I'm going to build Airbnb for X," it's not something that people say. I think the signs that come to mind are one, higher fragmentation. I think you want this long tail of buyers and sellers without a handful of big players controlling the market, because this is where you can provide value by doing this job of aggregation. I think you also want a relatively uniform set of needs. That means that it can be, like your supply can be commoditized to some extent. This is what's so tricky, by the way, about services, service marketplaces like Thumbtack, because unlike eBay, where sellers, they just want to sell very clear and distinct inventory, on Thumbtack you have electricians who only want certain types of jobs, but they only want it if they're available that day. And they might take a job and cancel it because something better comes up.

(00:25:34):
And so, this makes for a very fuzzy definition of supply, and you have very different set of needs. One electrician wants something, the other one has a very different perception of the same unit of demand, and that makes it very, very difficult. So, it's feasible, but I would say that is not a compelling attribute for building a marketplace. So, a relatively uniform set of needs. And the last one I'd mention is a high enough bearer in the matchmaking or the creation. I think how hard it is for people to find each other today, and how much effort do they have to put in to vet each other, I think is another great sign. The higher it is, the bigger the opportunity because it means you come in, implement the right processes to simplify this exchange of value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):
Awesome. I'd love to know if there's any examples you can think of, of bad marketplace ideas that people have tried, but I'll summarize the three points you just made, which I love. So, these are signs that this is a great opportunity for marketplace business, that there's a lot of fragmentation on both sides. There's not just a small number of companies or customers on one side or the other, because if there are, why do they need you? There's five airlines or whatever, you don't need a marketplace to match with an airline. Then two is there's uniform needs, the needs are basically consistent. I just want to stay in a home, I want a car to take me somewhere, I want a plumber.

(00:27:04):
And then there's a barrier, there's complexity to the matchmaking and helping someone book the thing, work with them. Finding a car, I imagine is like, I'm not going to just flag down a car. There's challenge there. I'm not going to just go and ask someone, "Can I stay in your home?" There's challenges there.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:27:19):
Exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):
Awesome. Are there any examples of companies you've seen that are just like, that will never work as a marketplace, or here's a funny example of a marketplace that tried to be a marketplace and it's not ...

Benjamin Lauzier (00:27:29):
I don't have a great example of that, but I can give you a tangentially related example of a marketplace that I don't want to throw anyone under the bus. I respect the company and the effort, but Sidecar at the time was another ride-sharing company competing with Lyft and Uber, and there's, I'm sure a whole bunch of lessons there. They ended up closing, but I think one really interesting direction that they took pretty early on to differentiate themselves was, in my mind perhaps very naively a mistake, they decided to give complete control to the user where as a user you had a whole bunch of filters. You could decide, "I want a car that's at least 2015 or newer. I want a driver that's at least this or newer." And so, I think the theory was reasonable on paper. It was like, "Hey, let's give people more control over it."

(00:28:29):
But you have those other players out there, you have Lyft and Uber, and people feel forced in this standardized experience, "We're going to compete by giving you the choice, you get to decide the experience that you want." I think in reality, it just fragments your marketplace even further, and you have this hyper fragmentation in your marketplace, and I think it hurt their SLAs quite drastically. If you think about the ETA, when you ask explicitly you're like, "Yeah, sure, I want a newer car," and you slide it to 2020 not realizing that you just lost 10 minutes because now we had a great driver, but they have a Honda Civic from 2018, and it's not the special that you wanted. 

(00:29:08):
So, I think people who build marketplaces tend to want to give a lot of control to the users because this is what users want, or this is what comes up oftentimes in user feedback like, "Oh, we have those two distinct group of users. Those ones, they really want new cars. Those ones, they don't want new cars." And so, naturally you have a product team that builds the toggle to get the new cars, and I think the mistake is that you unknowingly fragment your supply in a way that has a much more meaningful impact on the health of your marketplace than you suspect. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:43):
I think this is another awesome example of don't over listen to users and do what you think is going to be best for the business, and this is not even a marketplace lesson. It's just generally you don't want to give users more options than they will need to be successful and happy. And I think Sidecar did that because they were trying to differentiate from Lyft and Uber, like, "What can we do differently?" And they're like, "Oh, let's give people all these options." I think they even let drivers choose the price that they're offering their ride at, which made it extra complicated. They're like, "Oh my God, all these cars at different prices," but I respect their attempt because they were just the third wheel, no pun intended.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:30:21):
Ironically, it's almost the opposite advice that I usually give to companies who struggle with market health, it's if you have different verticals, try if possible to open up your supply walls. Your user is telling you like X, but try to give them something that is tangential to what you think they want, because odds are that they are actually fine with it. There's this amazing example from Thumbtack, it's the smoke machine example. So Thumbtack, now they specialize a little bit more in home services, but a few years ago they were also doing a lot of events. So, you had DJs, you had photographers, and a lot of people were hiring for wedding DJs on the platform. And one of the checkboxes was a smoke machine, and it turns out a lot of people are checking this. You're like, "Yeah, hell yeah, I want a smoke machine at my wedding."

(00:31:14):
And unknowingly to them, obviously, only 5% of our DJs had a smoke machine, and so you would carve out 95% of our supply. And if when we talked to users, they were like, "Oh, no, no, I don't care that much about the smoke machine. I didn't realize that this was automatically going to remove half of the supply." And so, work on ways to make this checkbox affect the ranking but not the actual filtering is a great example of how you can listen to your users and tweak the experience, but simplify their cognitive load by knowing like, "Hey, we know you prefer a smoke machine, but we're intelligent enough to know it's probably not a deal breaker for you."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
I love that example. The other thing that I think is important to talk about briefly is when you're thinking about building a marketplace, a lot of times they fail because the business model just doesn't work. I think about a company like Cherry that tried to do Uber for car washes, and in theory there's a smart idea of I'm going to just do on-demand car wash. The problem is no one's going to pay what it costs to do that, to a car wash person shows up and washes your car. I think cleaning is another example. There's also just like going-

Benjamin Lauzier (00:32:26):
Exec is another one that comes to mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:27):
Oh Exec, yeah, where it's just like someone come does stuff for you.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:32:32):
Something, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:32):
Yeah. And so I guess, is there anything you want to add there? Just like this is another reason your marketplace might fail? And maybe just let me expand on this question. Just what are the most common reasons marketplaces fail in your experience? And I think it's important to say most marketplace ideas fail, just like most startup ideas fail.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:32:49):
Yeah, most ideas period fail, I think. Yes. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:51):
Most ideas period fail, same. Coming back to most of the things you're going to struggle with are the same things that every company struggles with outside of marketplace. So, let me just ask, is maybe specifically within marketplaces or even just broadly, what are the biggest reasons that marketplaces fail?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:33:06):
I think a few things come to mind. One is this concept of liquidity that we've talked about. So, you need to kick off this flywheel, you need to build enough of that density within your marketplace. And depending on the business, you can take a lot of time or money, and without the right diagnostic framework you can end up running out of both. And so it's like, that's the same one, and I felt this at Lyft, I've seen this at other companies, this rush like, "Wow, we have to get to this point, otherwise we know it's a losing battle until we have enough density for both sides to have a good enough experience." The other one that I see is ignoring one side. So, we talked about doing that when you're early on, but I see a lot of larger companies operating for too long as one-sided businesses. Many large marketplaces only thinking about their demand side funnel.

(00:34:01):
So they run ads, they get clicks, they turn those clicks into dollars, and they try to get enough supplies that intuitively the experience is good enough for users. And my advice is, if you're doing this you're missing out on half of your business. And the trick is marketplaces are very laggy, so once your network effects start to die down it turns into this moment of panic of, "Oh shoot, we forgot about half of our users. We forgot that sellers are people too, and they're all leaving, and now we need to completely transform our product to save the ship, and to create a compelling value proposition on their side." So, that's the other thing that I see is businesses realizing that they are marketplaces with true marketplace needs too late in the game. And the last one is quality. I think we talked a little bit about the quality before, but it doesn't mean that you always need to have the best quality in your marketplace, but being a marketplace implies a level of curation.

(00:34:58):
You need to be intentional about the quality that you aim to provide, and I think a lot of companies don't have necessarily that intentionality and you have this constant push of supply, "If only we'd lower our bar a little bit, we could get more supply." And so until you end up, we've all experienced this at some point, you found some e-commerce website, you look for something and there is also like, "Oh my god, this looks super shady," because all the sellers don't look that great. That's a quality problem. And so, you need to be intentional about your quality and I think that's another area where companies fail.

(00:36:23):
Kind of as a segue from that idea of quality, I want to talk about managed marketplaces, managed supply. So, I think the reason quality is such an issue for marketplaces is because you do not own the supply and control the supply your marketplace, you're not just selling something, quality is innately going to be a challenge. Airbnb doesn't own homes, Uber doesn't employee drivers. They can't even legally tell them exactly what to do because their contractors, so quality is always this ongoing challenge with marketplaces. So, there's always this push towards making it more of a managed marketplace. We give people a lot more instruction, maybe they own some of the supply, maybe they invest a lot in training, all that kind of stuff. And in a perfect world, not unlike an idealized world, quality will be best if you own it. But then you're no longer marketplace, your business model sucks. I guess just any thoughts on marketplaces that are considering becoming more managed? Any advice on when it makes sense to move towards that spectrum, and how far to go?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:37:27):
I think when you're running a marketplace, you tend to sit in your ivory tower a little bit looking at stats and thinking, "If only we could get people to do X, it'd be better for everyone." And I certainly did that in my career. I think that's missing the point that we're humans, and I think sometimes we act in ways that are non-deterministic or intuitive. I'll mention another example, but we'd originally sell leads to pros like plumbers and electricians. And of those leads, obviously only a fraction would turn into actual jobs and revenue for those pros. So, we also saw that those pros were always great at converting leads into jobs. And so, naturally we thought that we could provide a more consistent experience for customers and for pros by improving their ROI and selling bookings directly to those pros. It's a common marketplace move, going from some version of lead to a direct booking.  

(00:38:22):
And digital, great. We knew we were going to improve their ROI by something like 20% maybe, and we launched this and pros hated it. They hated it because they actually subconsciously, they liked the thrill of the sale. They loved this contact with customer, and they sometimes completely overestimated their ability to close the customer. They were like, "You took all those phone calls, they kept me busy. I felt like I was hustling, I was about to close this customer." And so, no matter what the data says of like, "Oh, we increased their earnings by 20%," the pros don't feel this way and it's the right to feel however they want. And we saw the same thing at Lyft when trying to make driver earnings less volatile, we had to fight a lot of that perception and a lot of that peak end effect. So, my call-out here is any attempt at control can be really tricky and backfire in ways that are unpredictable.

(00:39:12):
You also touched on employment classification. In the U.S., when you talk about controlling supply, all the lawyers are like, "No, no, no, that's not something that we do." Because if you control your supply, then there can be legally classified as employees and be entitled to a whole bunch of benefits. So, my take on this in general is I'm a huge believer, and it really depends on the type of company I should say, obviously, but my take is I'm a huge believer in market forces and empowerment. So, provide guardrails for what a good experience is in your marketplace, set a clear bar for quality, and provide the right coaching and tools for supply to be successful. And then take a step back and see where the gaps are, and invest more in hands-on tactics just to close those gaps more specifically.

(00:40:02):
So, lots of coaching tools that Lyft, Uber did it, like most marketplaces provide some sort of coaching. You have a review system perhaps, you have stars for your sellers, for sellers who fall below the threshold then coach them, provide them the right tools, the right guidance, what is the standard that you have on your marketplace and help them meet that bar. And for people who fall through the gaps that you have, then that's when you invest in more hands-on tools. And this is one of the things that we did at Lyft also with the rental company that we spent up. I'm happy to tell you more about that, that's interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:40):
I'd love to hear about that. Before we hear that, is there any marketplace that has been very good at upleveling quality without becoming managed, that did this really well that you can think of?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:40:54):
Yeah, there's a talent marketplace called Toptal, and they are specialized in this. They have a really high bar for quality, they claim to only have the top 1%, top 3% I believe, of talent there. And they have a really amazing set of checks and processes. This funny story from them, but apparently they advertise something maybe a 3% pass rate for their talent, so they only on board like 3% of the people who apply. And allegedly their actual pass rate is even lower than that, but they thought that if they actually advertise the actual number it would sound fake. And so, they actually say 3% because 1% would sound like too ridiculous and it would discredit their talent. So, they're one company that does a tremendous amount of work for vetting quality early on with a ton of different checks, but also maintaining that quality. So, throughout with the right coaching tools, with education and things like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:06):
That's a really good example. And so, basically they just vet and only approve high quality supply in their case. It's mostly engineers, right? I think on Toptal?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:42:16):
Correct. Yes, it's mostly engineers, designers, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:18):
Which you can only do if you have so much supply that has so much interest in becoming part of your platform, but that's a really cool example. Basically it's just only allow really high quality supply. Let's hear this rental car story, so this is Lyft trying to do rental cars, right?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:42:32):
Correct. Yes, yes. Yeah, so this is a little bit of context. I was leading the driver's side of product at Lyft, and General Motors had invested half a billion dollars in our last round of funding. And this was Christmas Eve, I'll always remember, I got a call from Lyft CEO and General Motors CTO, and we decided to build a rental company essentially. And the reason for it was really fascinating. GM had all those vehicles that were coming off of lease, and that they were forced to sell at auctions they didn't really know what to do with. And from our perspective, we had this massive supply gap. We've talked about this before, but we had this huge supply crunch, we were growing super fast and couldn't hire drivers fast enough, couldn't onboard drivers fast enough. And when we looked at the market, we realized that 50% of the job seekers and welfare recipients in the U.S. don't have a car.

(00:43:26):
So, that was our supply gap. This was a huge pool of people that we just couldn't tap into because they didn't have a car. And so, by renting cars we could essentially manufacture our own supply. We could dial this up and down, we could be very surgical about how many vehicles do we bring in, which markets do we bring this in, at what price? We could even offer to pay for the car if they drove 30 hours a week and completely transform the lives of those people, now we allow them to have true mobility. They can go buy groceries, they can go take the kids on vacation. So, a huge win-win for everybody with something like this. And I think in few months we had built a rental company from the ground up, and within 18 months I think we were the fourth-largest rental fleet in the U.S. 

(00:44:10):
But all of this stemmed from this gap that we saw of like, okay, it's not about controlling the drivers in general. It's about like, okay, we want to be surgical. We want to control the quality of the cars on the platform. So, we talked about that, that's a great example. In the markets where we thought the vehicles of quality was too low, we knew we could onboard more rental vehicles that were more recent to raise the average age of a vehicle on the platform. So, it gave us more control in a much more surgical way, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:44):
So, it's not that you are launching a rental car service, the idea was add supply and give drivers a car so that they could become drivers.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:44:54):
It was a bit of both. We actually launched, it was we had vehicles that drivers could rent from Lyft, and to drive on the platform, and also to drive for their personal needs essentially. But yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
Got it, okay. And then, did this actually work and have impact? Was this a good idea?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:45:16):
Yeah. Yeah, it had a tremendous impact. Like I mentioned, I think we scaled this exponentially to become, I think again, the fourth-largest rental fleet in the U.S. because it was so effective for us, both because we had the right amount of control, but also those drivers were incredibly loyal to us. We had a whole bunch of other incentives that we could do, we could offer to pay for the car but only if you don't drive for the competition for Uber, and only if you drive at least 30 hours a week. So, this again provided us with, again, much greater retention, much higher engagement, and was a real incentive for us but also for the drivers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:59):
Awesome. And maybe the reason it's most interesting is this is along the spectrum of a managed marketplace. It moves closer to you guys are paying and covering costs of cars. It makes it less just like this simple, highly efficient marketplace.

Benjamin Lauzier (00:46:15):
Exactly, yeah. It's the marketplace version of maybe your black car fleet owner has their fleet of vehicle and they have people. So, this was the marketplace version of doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:26):
And it's also just a differentiator, because GM and you guys were close, and so you had this lever that say Uber didn't have. Amazing. Another area that I know you spent time on that I think is really interesting, and I think it'd be helpful to people to hear is the mentorship program, and the ambassador program that you had at Lyft, and how that helped you scale much more quickly than other folks were able to. Can you share that story?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:46:52):
Pretty early on at Lyft, this was 2014, 2015 maybe, Uber was basically 30X our size. They had 30 times more revenue, more people, more liquidity, everything you can think of. They were growing like crazy, and we had a bit of this existential moment, as you can imagine, where we were wondering how we're supposed to compete with that. And we had to be super clever, everything that you did at the company had to be 10 times more efficient per person than the competition just to survive. That was the bar, just not to die, and put a lot of pressure on us but we basically found a clever way of onboarding drivers at a fraction of the cost and resources. So, let me give you a little bit of context on how the onboarding flow worked. So, at the time, the last step to get onboarded as a driver was after you background check and your driving record check came back, you had to do a visual inspection of your car, a quick test drive, some light training, and we would check your documents.

(00:47:53):
We would check that you are the person with a driver's license and all those things. And Uber at the time would launch a team on the ground, they would go and open an office and they would have DMV-style group onboarding sessions and car inspections. And we did this as well in our first three to four markets, but you can imagine the overhead and the lead time. You had to go and you had to find office space, sign the lease, hire employees, you had huge, huge lead time. And we thought about it, and at the time a huge competitive differentiator for us was our brand. As a passenger or as a driver, why would you use a platform with lower liquidity? As a driver, you had lower earnings guaranteed. As a passenger, you had longer wait times. Why would you use a service like that? You do because of the brand, because of its values, it's how it makes you feel.

(00:48:41):
And so, we had the pink mustaches at the time, we had this very strong brand identity. I think a lot of that has been lost now, but we also had this amazing community of drivers who were fierce advocates for the brand. And so, what we did is leveraging this community and building essentially a soft onboarding supply engine where we would pay our best drivers $35 per mentor session, and a mentor session was essentially replacing this onboarding flow. So, it was basically another driver looking at your vehicle to check all your documents, take photos of your driver's license and all that stuff, and take you on a short ride along. And the benefits of this were absolutely mind-blowing and kind of unexpected for us on all sides. First, the mentors were our very best drivers, and they were evangelists for the brand. So, what they did was they would share personal tips on when and where to drive.

(00:49:34):
Oftentimes they shared their contact info. And this created tremendous leverage and social proof for those new drivers who were on the fence about taking strangers into their car. It's actually quite funny because we had the brightest minds in the company writing the best marketing emails and copy, like, "Hey, hop on the car and drive this Saturday." And you had all those drivers and all those mentors like, "No, no, don't listen to those Lyft guys. Here's what you should do. Go on Tuesday at 2:00 PM, text me, I'll tell you where the good spot is, and this is how you're going to get rides. This is how you're going to get rich and make a lot of money." And this recognition lever was just so much more powerful than anything we could be telling you. And so, very, very efficient activation lever for the new drivers. For us, also incredibly scalable.

(00:50:22):
We could fly a small team to rigorously vet and onboard maybe like 10, 20 top drivers, and then they'd fly to a different market, and we would let the rest of our drivers be onboarded by those mentors. And even for those mentors, for those top drivers, it was an incredible recognition lever. For them, if you were a 4.9 driver, you had enough rides, you had a chance to make it into being a mentor, and this provided additional earnings opportunity for you. If you did two mentor sessions in an hour, you could make 70 bucks an hour. You could take a break from driving if you're tired, and just do some of those. It felt like getting promoted at a job. And so, it actually had a huge impact on the retention of our very best drivers, which was unexpected. So, a lot of really, really interesting benefits, and we actually lean into this and built a couple of really fascinating variations of this for a while, but this allowed us to match most of Uber's footprint with a 10th or a 20th of the resources at incredible speed, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:21):
That is an amazing story, and it's such a great lever that I totally agree, I don't hear people using and I wonder why. So, what I'm hearing is it was cheaper, the drivers were making money. I imagine the drivers trained by the mentors ended up being better drivers, that's what we saw at Airbnb, hosts that came in through a referral ended up being better hosts, for whatever reason. And you're saying basically, this is what allowed you to compete with Uber at a much smaller scale and much less money raised. Amazing. 

Benjamin Lauzier (00:51:51):
Exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):
You said there's a couple of variations. Is there anything interesting there to share, just things that you built as a follow-up based on the success?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:51:58):
So, the next step in that journey was basically we were growing like crazy, but now we had cracks in like the activation phase, but now we had a whole bunch of people dropping off in the funnel before activation]. So, they didn't enter their SSN, they didn't enter the right info for us to run all those checks in the previous steps of the onboarding flow. So, we built a team of hundreds of account executives, and their job was just pick up the phone and call those drivers. And so, we had the same aha moment of like could we get some of our best drivers to do that for us, and empower them to be a part of this? And so, we did this and we launched another, like I said, role. We called them recruiters. And so, as a recruiter, as a driver, you could just, if this was quiet on the road, you could just hop on your phone and you would have a mini sales dashboard where you could claim leads.

(00:52:49):
And this was a driver who had dropped off in the funnel, and you had a telephone number, you could just call them and text them. And same thing, those guys were outperforming our very best of trained salespeople, because it's not like, "Hey, it's Ben from Lyft. Hop on the road, please." It's like, "Hey, my name is James and I'm a fellow driver as well. Lyft told me that you have a incomplete application. Do you have any questions? Do you want me to come to your house, we can do this together?" And we would pay them 20 bucks per person that they converted to activation. And so, something incredibly scalable for us, another way for us to reward and recognize our best drivers.

(00:53:27):
And it also provided a really interesting way for us to smooth out the supply and demand. The problem with a marketplace like Lyft is that you have this big spike. Everyone wants to drive on a Tuesday at 2:00 PM, but everyone wants rides on a Saturday at 2:00 AM. And so, how can you manufacture demand during those low utilization times? This was a great way to do that. Now you could wait on the road and still make money while just sitting in your car while waiting for the next ride. So, this was another iteration of this model that was really cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:58):
Amazing. That is so cool. I just know the feeling of being on a team, coming up with this idea and the thing working must feel so great. Just like, "Holy shit, look at this. Look at all these cool things that we can do with our supply." Something I wasn't going to get into, but it might be interesting just to hear if you have thoughts on this. So, I've been a huge fan of Lyft from the beginning, I used Lyft the very first weekend it came out in San Francisco when there was like five drivers. It was like a beta test, I was friends with someone that worked at Lyft early on, and it was just like, "Man, Lyft's the best." I was like all Lyft, Uber sucks, I hate that. I want to give it the fist bump or the mustache. So great. Today though, I was just looking at market caps.

(00:54:38):
So, Uber is worth $150 billion, Lyft is worth $5 billion. I'm curious if you have thoughts on just, it feels like Uber has won at this point, and I don't know where Lyft goes. I know your heart is with Lyft and you worked at Lyft for a long time, I know it doesn't feel great to see how things have played out necessarily. I'm curious just to hear your take on just what do you think Uber did, if you look back, that allowed them to basically win? And where do you think Lyft goes from here? What do you think happens with Lyft? They're still worth 5 billion, it's still a huge, amazing, successful business, but just where do you think things go?

Benjamin Lauzier (00:55:15):
Yeah. I think it all went south when I left the company. I'm just kidding. No, and again, I have to call out the fact that I haven't been close to Lyft, and their business and strategy for many years at this point. So, take this with a grain of salt. This is my very naive perspective, but I think to me, perhaps the biggest blow to Lyft's business was somewhat inherent, like the vision. Lyft's vision was always anchored around transportation, people of transportation. The founders were deeply passionate about moving people, they were passionate about transforming the way people move around in a city. They wanted to just change how cities are designed, how roads are designed. And so, that meant investing in dynamic shuttles and things like that, and there's a lot of experimentation that went to that. But it also meant that Lyft never invested in things like food delivery, or goods and parcels, and things like that.

(00:56:26):
And I think that crushed them during COVID essentially. I think Uber had, I think at some point their slogan was moving in bits and atoms, or something like that. But I think it implies this notion of being a logistics platform for assets in the world, for transporting people, for transporting things, for transporting ... And I think they built, they invested lot in trucks and food delivery, and all those really exotic things that Lyft had never any intention to invest in. Not even because of the lack of resources, but because this was in part a distraction from our vision. We wanted to change how people move around in cities, we wanted to reinvent public transportation, we did not want to be a DoorDash competitor and help you get in donuts during COVID. And a huge part of it also was leaning heavily in shared rides. And so, this was like, again, how do you reinvent public transportation?

(00:57:28):
It's like every car is a dynamic bus, and now there's a bus line. The bus line is always running, it's always by your house. So, a lot of our investment I think in thinking went in that direction, and the last thing that people wanted with COVID was to be in a car with five strangers, but what people wanted is food delivered to their house. And so, I know that the business had a huge blow during COVID, whereas I think Uber was able to rebound much more quickly because of how diversified the business was. And so, it's funny now because I think Lyft actually killed shared rides, which was just so core to their identity. They were the first ones to launch this. And so yeah, the new COO I think killed the shared rides, which actually I'm really sad about. But yeah, so I think it indicates a very different vision now, a very different direction for the business. And yeah, that's my take, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:19):
Interesting. So, essentially COVID really effed them because their strategy was always about transportation, and when nobody needs a ride and people want food, strategically Uber made a really good move expanding into food delivery, which I think was a bigger business than rides for a long time. I don't know where it's at today for Uber, and Lyft didn't have that, and it's hard to recover from a time like that. So, it sounds like it's a combination of strategy was pointing Lyft in a certain direction, and circumstances in the world just made it really hard-

Benjamin Lauzier (00:58:50):
And losing me me. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:51):
And losing Ben. So, you left in 2019, March 2019, and is that when they went public? 

Benjamin Lauzier (00:58:52):
Not for the IPO.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):
Yeah, and it's all downhill from then. And then-

Benjamin Lauzier (00:59:03):
I'm telling you. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:04):
... during COVID actually, when there was a big bump, which I think when people started riding again, and then it went down again. So, I think there was a correlation there, so there we go. That's the thing, don't ever fire Ben, don't let Ben leave. That's our take on it. 

Benjamin Lauzier (00:59:16):
I was not fired, yeah. Just to be clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:18):
Okay, just different ways you might leave a company, don't let it happen. 

Benjamin Lauzier (00:59:23):
I know, I'm kidding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:25):
Okay, so there's two more things I want to spend a little time on before we close up. One is your work in Europe, so you're a product leader in Europe, and I want to hear a little bit about what it's like to be a product person in Europe. And then two, I want to hear about the startup. So, at this point no one can actually fire. You have your own company that you're running, and I want to spend a little time here. Usually we don't spend time on this sort of stuff, but you're working on something very cool that I think is going to be really helpful to a lot of people in a really meaningful way. So, I want to spend a little time there. But before that, so you're living in France now. Before you started your company, you were interviewing for CPR roles in France, you work with a lot of French companies, European companies. I'm curious what you've noticed might be different in the cultures of tech companies in France and Europe in general versus the U.S.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:00:12):
It's been really fascinating, I think. So, my entire career has been in the U.S., and I'm just starting to understand what that European and the French market in particular looks like. And my read so far is that product management has really exploded I think in Europe in recent years, but the market dynamics are still quite different. In the U.S. I think you have this inherently very liquid and dynamic market. I think, this is my interpretation of it, but I think it leads to greater ownership and accountability for people and product at all levels. So, product managers and leaders, they join a startup and you're immediately in charge of a relatively meaningful piece of the business, with genuine autonomy oftentimes. It doesn't always happen, but oftentimes I think that's the case. And if things don't work out, well, there's this expectation that you'll be managed out.

(01:01:09):
There are countless memes on LinkedIn about the tenure of CPOs at tech companies to illustrate that. I think in France the market is much less liquid, so it's incredibly difficult to change jobs, and it's very expensive to fire someone in France. So, it seems to lead to two effects beyond the obvious job security. One is, I think PMs tend to have less autonomy and ownership, and a little bit more like micromanagement. And there are also less business owners than they can be in the U.S. And I see founders and managers struggling to let go of control a little bit more, again because it's understandable in a way, you don't have as much of a control as you do in the U.S. And so, you see a lot of really fascinating effects.

(01:01:55):
You have startups who tend to wait a little bit longer before hiring, especially in product. The art of product a little bit less of a thing. You have a lot of amazing PMs in France, but the recognition of the craft is a little bit different outside of the people who practice it. And you have a lot of real interesting outsourcing also, you see startups and companies of all sizes actually relying on great product studios, like Mozza, to build end-to-end products from the ground up. So, something that's been really, really interesting. Another side that I see is this dominance of business over tech in France.

(01:02:35):
There isn't as much of a cult of technology and software engineering in France as there is in the U.S. And so, the French Ivy League schools are business schools, like HEC, and the most highly valuable skill that you get is soft skills around management and business. It differs from the stereotype of the CS degree, Stanford dropout that you have in Silicon Valley. And I think because of a few of those things that I just mentioned, less liquid job market, but also less liquid financial markets, the last thing that I've observed that's interesting that's also around ownership I guess, is equity is much less meaningful in France. So, of the product leaders that I talked to, most of them consider their equity to be virtually worthless. None of them know of anyone who's made a down payment on a house thanks to their sort of equity.

(01:03:25):
So, it's seen as a nice bonus, but it's not the token of ownership and the promise of future wealth that it can be in the U.S. when you join a startup. For exec roles, I think it's often sub 10% of their total compensation, whereas in the U.S. it's very often more than 50% of your compensation will be equity. So, that's been interesting in terms of the dynamic, but it's also been real interesting to just see how vibrant the startup culture is here in France. You have a truly exciting innovation happening, especially in AI. You have a lot of French companies at the forefront of this, like Mistral AI and Hugging Face, and things like that.

(01:04:03):
And also how it's been exciting to see how the government is leaning into that as a catalyst for this innovation. I think the French government has dedicated something like $2.5 billion in funding to support French AI excellence by 2030. So, they're running a lot of internal government incubators to try to disrupt some of the government functions from the inside, and they're hiring top talents to do that. I've met some of the people working on this, it's just really fascinating. It makes me super excited about what a federal startup task of reinventing [inaudible 01:04:38] would look like. So yeah, it's been really exciting to see the whole space and how it differs from the U.S.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:45):
Fascinating. So, I know there's also AI regulation that feels really strange in Europe, but think that's EU based, not like France specifically.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:04:46):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:55):
Yeah, that people are not excited about. There's just a lot of fear of AI, and so there's a lot of regulation talk in Europe.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:05:02):
I'm a big Android guy, and a lot of the features like Gemini and all this is only available in the U.S., and now that I'm in France I see the difference a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):
Interesting. So, the cultural differences you spoke of, do you think they're rooted in the fact that people don't move jobs often, or is it culture? People just don't learn to work in the way that people learn to work in the U.S. in the product role? What do you think is the root of why things are so different?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:05:35):
I'm not quite sure, it's a good question. My take, and I think this is I'm sure very naive and reductive, and I know this is one of my core principles, so I'm sure I also have a tunnel vision on this a little bit. But to me, one of the biggest difference that I see is really around this concept of ownership and accountability. Whereas in the U.S., and again, I saw it, I'm sure you saw it at Airbnb, you see it at a lot of companies, not everywhere, but a lot of companies will hire you, give you a big chunk of the business, and it's up to you to prove yourself out. Where you have six months, you have a year, it's up to you to show impact. I think the French employment model is less conducive to this type of dynamic, because employment is much more rigid.

(01:06:20):
So, you have much less of this hire now and prove yourself out, it's much more of prove yourself beforehand. And if you've made a bad hire than as a founder, you become perhaps a little bit cagey about your vision. You want to be more hands-on because you made a bad hire. It's not like someone perfect, then he'll make you work but it means you'll be more hands-on in the work of PMs daily, and perhaps we'll think like, "Oh, maybe I don't need product managers who want on my vision, I'll hire project managers," or something like that. So, it's perhaps slightly more conducive to those types of dynamics.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:53):
And you're saying that's in part because it's harder to fire people in France and in Europe?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:06:58):
Yeah, I think so. It's not just about firing I think, to be clear, I just think it's culturally the market seems like a lot less liquid and dynamic.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:05):
So, people don't move around as much, they stick around for a long time.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:07:10):
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):
Got it. And it sounds like there's also just a cultural difference of founders innately are much more, "I am in control, and I'm not going to hire people and trust you to take this thing on. I'm just going to run the show." It's basically Paul Graham's founder mode is already instilled in everyone.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:07:29):
Maybe yeah, maybe that's a little bit. And I think also it's this culture of business, so very business-centric sort of culture. And again, it makes sense, the markets, you have less venture capital, you have less equity in the financial markets as well. And so, when you raise funding you need to have a strong business case. The business case is at the center of your habits. Whereas I think oftentimes in the U.S. you have, again, it's a little bit stereotypical, but it's a very tech or product-centric view of the world, or it can be a very tech or product-centric view of the world where it'll be like this product, this is the vision of the product, and sometimes even the business model will follow. And in France, I think the business model has to be front and center perhaps for you to be able to raise venture capital for you to be able to even exist. So, it means it attracts a lot of business minded entrepreneurs, much more so perhaps than tech-minded or product-minded entrepreneurs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):
Got it. If someone wants to help their company in Europe and France operate more closely to the way companies in the U.S. operate, do you have any advice for them? I know you talk and work with a lot of companies in Europe, what do you help them change and see differently?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:08:47):
Yeah, it's a great question. I haven't fully cracked that, and think it's a really hard question. I'll give some sort of small pointers that have helped at least some of the companies that I've talked to. But the one is equity, I think there's a desire from a lot of the founders that I talk to, to give equity to employees, but because it's not in the culture yet I think employees also have an under-appreciation for equity. Like, "Well yeah, it's nice, but I don't know what's going to happen. I just work for the CEO anyways." There's less of this sense of, again, ownership that you can have in the U.S.

(01:09:22):
And so, I think leaning into that and investing in education around equity, the case is also in the U.S., I'm convinced 80% of people just don't fully understand their equity. But I think leaning into that, especially in Europe, to help people understand the value of their equity, help them by telling more about the story of the business, the trajectory of the business, why it matters for their future equity. I think anything along those lines I think can help cultivate this greater ownership mindset, I think for people.

(01:09:58):
And then yeah, I think another big piece again is, at least to me this is a big recipe to successful product teams, is to develop teams that revolve around this concept of ownership and accountability teams that are clearly owning a huge, or it doesn't have to be huge, like a slice of the business, not feature teams like shipping maybe guests, but teams that have clear accountability with consequences, but also clear ownership and leeway to do their best and to thrive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:29):
Again, I usually don't spend time on this sort of thing, but I just think that what you're working on is extremely cool, and I think it's going to be really meaningful to a lot of people. And so, I just want to spend a few minutes giving you a chance to talk about what you're working on now. You started a company, is this your first company that you've started? 

Benjamin Lauzier (01:10:45):
It is, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:45):
It is first company. 

Benjamin Lauzier (01:10:46):
First real company. Doesn't accept projects, but first company. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):
Yeah, there's a LC, there's a C corp, or yeah, it's like filed. There's paperwork. Amazing. Talk about what you're building, how people know how to find it if it's right for them.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:10:59):
Yeah, I have to say entrepreneurship has been a very humbling journey. I think the zero to one is way harder than anything us have done so far, and I feel like when you're used to building and scaling products within companies, you take for granted, at least I did, I take for granted that the problem space has already been validated. You have some brand equity, even if you launch a new vertical, there's an existing user base, there's a validation of the broader problem space. I think going to truly zero felt, at least to me, super overwhelming and lonely, but also super exciting with tons of condensed learnings. It's been a really interesting journey. So, what brought me there is my wife started to have some health issues about three years ago now, it's partially why we decided to move to France last year just for a couple of years.

(01:11:47):
And she's had this undiagnosed condition and chronic pain, and we saw just how much of a nightmare it was to manage her care and to navigate the healthcare system in the U.S. So, we'd wait three months for an appointment for a neurologist, then did see her for maybe eight minutes. Average appointment time in the U.S. is between 10 and 12 minutes. They'd dump a bunch of jargon, say like, "Hey, tests all look normal. Sorry, you should just go see this other specialist instead." Would wait another three months, see another specialist. And with a lot of anxiety, a lot of pain, as you can imagine, all those things, you have another eight minute slot with someone and you're like, "Oh, why didn't the neurologist do this test? I can help you, let's make some sense." And so, it ends up being incredibly isolating. The whole time we just felt completely alone.

(01:12:32):
It was just like us and Google, we felt we kept getting conflicting advice from doctors, and I was spending all my time researching specialists, what solutions to consider, spend all my nights reading through research papers to [inaudible 01:12:48], "Hey, what is the academic consensus on this particular treatment that the doctors don't seem to know about?" And throughout this whole process it felt like no one really had her back, no one within the medical system was fighting for her the way that your family doctor might have fought for you 20 years ago, knowing everything about you and being like, "Lenny, let's talk about this. I know your uncle had this," or there's this sort of a sense of advocacy that came from your family doctor that just doesn't exist today. It's not uncommon for doctors to have thousands of patients that they see just a few minutes each year.

(01:13:19):
And so digging into this, we just realized it's not an isolated case. You have nearly half of Americans have at least one chronic condition, or have to deal with some sort of complex health issue largely on their own. You see a lot of those large online communities revolving around chronic conditions or chronic pain, and trying to make sense of it and advocate for themselves. And I think I want to be clear, in my mind the problem is obviously not about the practitioners, it's systemic. It's just growing financial pressure from private equity firms, it's just countless other factors. But you see the physicians being overwhelmed, overworked, burning out, and you see that pressure just only increasing, I think. So, I basically spent the next six months just talking to hundreds of patients, and doctors, and experts, and what we built is basically a platform to help people fight for their health.

(01:14:12):
And so, we want to close the gap between patients and the healthcare system. There's this critical layer of the system that's missing, I think, people are navigating life-threatening or debilitating conditions largely with Google, and at some point you just get tired of fighting for yourself. So, we connect people with complex conditions, typically with their own health advocate. So, it's essentially like their own health assistant. They're available 24/7 to help you navigate your care. So, we find appointments for you, we help you prepare your appointment, we make sense of a diagnosis, of test results. We spend hours researching solutions and potential treatments, and just more generally we do everything we can to help you just better advocate for themselves basically. And now we launched in the U.S. a early version of this few weeks ago, and the engagement has been really, really, really mind-blowing so far. And we're helping cancer patients, people with a lot of those niche chronic conditions, and literally harassing the doctor's office like, "Hey, we still haven't received that referral."

(01:15:15):
All the things that you just get tired of doing when you're dealing with so many appointments, and when you're having to manage a condition like this. And our mental model is what would we do if this user was our partner or our parent? You'd likely spend all night combing through research. You'd call all the providers in the state to be like, "Hey, who has an appointment?" Because there's no PT available for the next two months. We'll find you a PT available sooner. So, we're building the engine to do that at scale essentially, and make people feel like they're not alone and that someone is fighting for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:45):
Super cool. It's sad that we need something like this, but we do, because the healthcare system is so not ideal. And so, it's basically someone in your corner that's just, it's like in the inside that knows how these things work that is there to help you through the process. What's the company called, where do people find it?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:16:03):
Yeah, it's called Nurra Health, and our website is Nurra, N-U-R-R-A.me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):
Awesome, and we'll link to it in the show notes. And just to be clear, I'm not an investor, I'm just excited about this thing. I think a lot of people need this. Just to loop back to what we've been talking about, it's not a marketplace. How would you describe this business in relation to marketplace companies?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:16:22):
We're ignoring the marketplace dynamics. I'm following my own advice, and I'm one jumpstarting one side of the marketplace, the health advocates were like jumpstarting this side for now, and we're only focusing on what I think is going be the hardest side for us, and it's going to be demand. How do we find those people? How do we create the right value proposition for them? So, that's what we're focused on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:44):
And so, in the future there may be a marketplace component, is what I'm hearing?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:16:49):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:50):
Interesting. Very cool. Ben, is there anything else that you want to share, mention, leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:16:59):
No, no. Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:01):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Ben, are you ready?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:17:06):
I'm ready, let's do it. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:08):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:17:14):
I'll give you books in different directions. One is Misbehaving: The Makings of Behavioral Economics. I'm really interested in behavioral economics, I love this intersection between economics and human psychology. It's a great analogy for product, so that's a great introduction to this field. The second book that I recommend a lot is Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World, by David Epstein. I've always felt curious about a lot of things, but it's made me feel like I'm decent at many things but I'm good at nothing. I'm very good at nothing. And so, even in my career I see all those pianists who are like machine learning gurus leading conferences on weekends that are contributing to think tanks, I just felt like a generalist.

(01:17:55):
So, if you feel this way, this is a good book to make you feel a little bit better by yourself and your imposter syndrome. At least it did for me. And last one, nothing to do with business, but Immune, by Philipp Dettmer. This is the creator of the YouTube channel Kurzgesagt. I don't know if I'm pronouncing this right, but it's a science channel. If you're even remotely curious about how your body works, how your immune system works, it's an amazing book that's really, really fun to read, super entertaining, and just great biology and fun book, I promise.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):
I've been trying to get the author of Range on the podcast, I have not had success yet. So, if anyone knows him, his name is Epstein? Is that right? 

Benjamin Lauzier (01:18:34):
Yes. David Epstein. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:36):
David Epstein, please connect me. I would love to have him on the podcast. I really love his message of just, basically it's the most successful people, or is it that you should be a generalist or that you can be very successful as a generalist? Is that the message?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:18:50):
You can be very successful as a generalist. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):
Yeah, great. I completely agree. That's been me too. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:18:58):
TV show? I haven't seen anything lately that's been mind-blowing, but I'll share an old new one. I've rewatched The Last of Us recently, and it's an old favorite. I love the TV show. I like the game, I played the game many years ago, and love the TV show

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:12):
When the heck's the next season coming up? I'm excited for that. Because I know the game has more-

Benjamin Lauzier (01:19:12):
2025.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):
2025. Oh man, so long. Okay, good to know though. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:19:25):
Maybe a little bit behind the curve on this one, but I've been loving the Arc browser. I don't know if you use it, but it's been-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):
Oh, I love Arc. It's my number one, my main browser. Absolutely, I love it.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:19:36):
Amazing. All right, so yeah, you know all about it. Yeah, it's been really fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Yeah, just the onboarding of the Arc browser is such a lesson in onboarding. They do such an amazing job. It's like that alone is a great thing to do as a product person, just see how they do onboarding.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:19:52):
I was like, I've been using Chrome for 12 years, or I don't know how many years, it feels like such high friction to change my entire life. In eight seconds it was done, it felt like home. I was like, "Wow, this is way faster than I expected."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:05):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite motto that you often come back to or repeat yourself, share with friends or family?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:20:11):
I don't have anything particularly philosophical, unfortunately. I lived in [inaudible 01:20:16] for a few years. I live now in the French Alps, so I have a frame with a John Muir's quote, "The mountains are calling and I must go." I feel like this is, it's my grounding place. The mountains are my happy place, and so I don't share that work often. I don't peace out in the middle of meetings like, "The mountains are calling, I must go." But it's been a grounding motto, I guess, for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:38):
That's beautiful. My nervous system relaxes just hearing that quote, and I know you live in a mountainy part of France so you've done it, you've listened to the call. Final question. You live in France, the Olympics were just in Paris. Did you go to any of the games? Did you watch any of the games? Anything stand out to you about the Olympics that were not so far from where you are now?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:21:02):
Good question. I did not see any live events, unfortunately. Perhaps the highlight for me was I'm a big mountain biker, but in the biking realm I love the Men BMX event where all three men on the podium were French, so this was a great moment for France.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):
I didn't even know that was an Olympic sport. So, it's a BMX, like dirt bike kind of race.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:21:32):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
So cool. Amazing. Ben, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online, and what else are you doing that people can check out if they want to learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:21:46):
Yeah, you can find me, two things that are perhaps helpful for people out there. One is I have a Reforge course if you're curious about marketplace, if you want to dig deeper into marketplace growth, I have a course on Reforge. We're about to do our fifth or sixth cohort I think now. It's been going really well, we've been working with tons of really, really cool marketplaces, going much deeper into some of the topics that we just talked about. So, if you're interested in marketplaces, I would say check this out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:13):
And on that real quick, is the customer ideal, is it founders or is it like PMs at larger marketplace companies? Who is this perfect for?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:22:23):
We've had both founders and PMs, and like a heads of product, but it's my strong recommendation it's people that have product market fit. Per our conversation, if you don't have product market fit, wait a little bit before enrolling in this course. Focus on your core business before worrying about the marketplace dynamics aspect.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:44):
And then I cut you off, there's something else you were going to point people to?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:22:47):
Oh, and just Nurra, the company that we're building. Anyone that you know, or if you yourself have chronic or complex conditions, and if you feel like you need help managing your health and navigating your care, would love to help or share what you need, and how we can help you. And our website is Nurra.me, N-U-R-R-A.me. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:09):
And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Benjamin Lauzier (01:23:11):
If you have advice, if you know anyone in the space, if you're interested in learning more about this, if you have advice, if you have learnings, if you know anything about this I would love to hear it. If you have hot takes about marketplace, if you disagree with any of what I've said, I'd love to also hear it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:25):
I love it. Ben, thank you so much for being here.

Benjamin Lauzier (01:23:30):
Thank you so much for having me, it's been a dream come true. Finally, I'm on this podcast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:34):
Same. Same for me, Ben. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You wrote somewhere that creating powerful AI might be the last invention humanity ever needs to make. How much time do we have, Ben?

Benjamin Mann (00:00:06):
I think 50th percentile chance of hitting some kind of superintelligence is now like 2028.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
What is it that you saw at OpenAI? What'd you experience there that made you feel like, okay, we got to go do our own thing?

Benjamin Mann (00:00:17):
We felt like safety wasn't the top priority there. The case for safety has gotten a lot more concrete, so superintelligence is a lot about how do we keep God in a box and not let the God out?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
What are the odds that we align AI correctly?

Benjamin Mann (00:00:29):
Once we get to superintelligence, it will be too late to align the models. My best granularity forecast for could we have an X-risk or extremely bad outcome is somewhere between 0 and 10%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Something that's in the news right now is this whole Zuck coming after all the top AI researchers,

Benjamin Mann (00:00:45):
We've been much less affected because people here, they get these offers and then they say, well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money and my best case scenario at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Dario, your CEO recently talked about how unemployment might go up to something like 20%.

Benjamin Mann (00:01:04):
If you just think about 20 years in the future where we're way past the singularity, it's hard for me to imagine that even capitalism will look at all like it looks today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):
Do you have any advice for folks that want to try to get ahead of this?

Benjamin Mann (00:01:15):
I'm not immune to job replacement either. At some point it's coming for all of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:20):
Today, my guest is Benjamin Mann. Holy moly. What a conversation. Ben is the co-founder of Anthropic. He serves as tech lead for product engineering. He focuses most of his time and energy on aligning AI to be helpful, harmless, and honest. Prior to Anthropic, he was one of the architects of GPT-3 at OpenAI. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including his thoughts on the recruiting battle for top AI researchers, why he left OpenAI to start Anthropic, how soon he expects we'll see AGI. Also, his economic touring test for knowing when we've hit AGI, why scaling laws have not slowed down and are in fact accelerating and what the current biggest bottlenecks are. Why he's so deeply concerned with AI safety and how he and Anthropic operationalize safety and alignment into the models that they build and into their ways of working. Also, how the existential risk from AI has impacted his own perspectives on the world and his own life and what he's encouraging his kids to learn to succeed in an AI future.

This episode is brought to you by Sauce. The way teams turn feedback into product impact is stuck in the past. Vague reports, static taxonomies, unactionable insights that don't move business metrics. The results churn, lost deals, misgrowth. Sauce is the AI product co-pilot that helps CPOs and product teams uncover business impact and act faster. It listens to your sales calls, support tickets, turn reasons, and lost deals, surfacing the biggest product issues and opportunities in real time.

(00:03:16):
It then routes them to the right teams to turn signals into PRDs, prototypes, and even code that drives revenue retention and adoption. That's why Whatnot, Linktree, Incident.io, and Zip use Sauce. One enterprise uncovered a product gap that unlocked $16 million ARR, another caught a spiking issue and prevented millions in churn. You can too at sauce.app/lenny. Sauce built for AI product teams. Don't get left behind.

(00:03:43):
This episode is brought to you by LucidLink, the storage collaboration platform. You've built a great product, but how you show it through video, design, and storytelling is what brings it to life. If your team works with large media files, videos, design assets, layer project files, you know how painful it can be to stay organized across locations, files live in different places. You're constantly asking, is this the latest version? Creative work slows down while people wait for files to transfer. LucidLink fixes this.

(00:04:47):
Ben, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Benjamin Mann (00:04:51):
Thanks for having me. Great to be here, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:53):
I have a billion and one questions for you. I'm really excited to be chatting. I want to start with something that's very timely, something that's happening this week. Something that's in the news right now is this whole Zuck coming after all the top AI researchers offering them $100 million signing bonuses, $100 million comp. He's poaching from all the top AI labs. I imagine this something you're dealing with. I'm just curious, what are you seeing inside Anthropic and just what's your take on the strategy? Where do you think things go from here?

Benjamin Mann (00:05:23):
Yeah, I mean I think this is a sign of the times. The technology that we're developing is extremely valuable. Our company is growing super, super fast. Many of the other companies in the space are growing really fast. And at Anthropic, I think we've been maybe much less affected than many of the other companies in the space because people here are so mission oriented and they stay because... They get these offers and then they say, "Well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money and my best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity and try to make AI flourish and human flourishing go well." To me, it's not a hard choice. Other people have different life circumstances and it makes it a much harder decision for them. For anybody who does get those mega offers and accepts them, I can't say I hold it against them when they accept it, but it's definitely not something that I would want to take myself if it came to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:26):
Yeah. We're going to talk about a lot of this stuff that you've mentioned. In terms of the offers do you think, is this a real number that you're seeing this $100 million signing bonus, is that a real thing? I don't know if you've actually seen that.

Benjamin Mann (00:06:36):
I'm pretty sure it's real.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
Wow.

Benjamin Mann (00:06:39):
If you just think about the amount of impact that individuals can have on a company's trajectory, in our case, we are selling hotcakes and if we get a 1 or 10 or 5% efficiency bonus on our inference stack, that is worth an incredible amount of money. And so to pay individuals like $100 million over four year package, that's actually pretty cheap compared to the value created for the business. I think we're just in an unprecedented era of scale and it's only going to get crazier actually. If you extrapolate the exponential on how much companies are spending, it's like 2X a year roughly in terms of CapEx, and today we're maybe in the globally $300 billion range, the entire industry spending on this, and so numbers like 100 million are a drop in the bucket. But if you go a few years out, a couple more doublings, we're talking about trillions of dollars and at that point it's just really hard to think about these numbers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:48):
Along these lines, something that a lot of people feel with AI progress is that we're hitting plateaus in many ways that it feels like newer models are just not as smart as previous leaps. But I know you don't believe this. I know you don't believe that we've hit plateaus on scaling loss. Talk about just what you're seeing there and what you think people are missing.

Benjamin Mann (00:08:06):
It's kind of funny because this narrative comes out every six months or so and it's never been true, and so I kind of wish people would have a little bit of a bullshit detector in their heads when they see this. I think progress has actually been accelerating where if you look at the cadence of model releases, it used to be once a year and now with the improvements in our post-training techniques, we're seeing releases every month or three months, and so I would say progress is actually accelerating in many ways, but there's this weird time compression effect. Dario compared it to being in a near light speed journey where a day that passes for you is like five days back on earth and we're accelerating. The time dilation is increasing.

(00:08:52):
And I think that's part of what's causing people to say that progress is slowing down, but if you look at the scaling laws, they're continuing to hold true. We did kind of need this transition from normal pre-training to reinforcement learning scaling up to continue the scaling laws, but I think it's kind of like for semiconductors where it's less about the density of transistors that you can fit on a chip and more about how many flops can you fit in a data center or something. You have to change the definition around a little bit to keep your eye on the prize. But yeah, this is one of the few phenomena in the world that has held across so many orders of magnitude. It's actually pretty surprising that it is continuing to hold. To me, if you look at fundamental laws of physics, many of them don't hold across 15 orders of magnitude, so it's pretty surprising.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:47):
It boggles the the mind. What you're saying essentially is we're seeing newer models being released more often, and so we're comparing it to the last version and we're just not seeing as much advance. But if you go back and it was like a model released once a year, it was a huge leap, and so people are missing that. We're just seeing many more iterations.

Benjamin Mann (00:10:04):
I guess, to be a little bit more generous to the people saying things are slowing down. I think that for some tasks we are saturating the amount of intelligence needed for that task, maybe to extract information from a simple document that already has form fields on it or something like it's just so easy that okay, yeah, we're already at 100% and there's this great chart on Our World in Data that shows that when you release a new benchmark within six to 12 months, it immediately gets saturated. And so maybe the real constraint is how can we come up with better benchmarks and better ambition of using the tools that then reveals the bumps in intelligence that we're seeing now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:51):
That's a good segue to you have a very specific way of thinking about AGI and defining what AGI means.

Benjamin Mann (00:10:57):
I think AGI is kind of a loaded term, and so I tend not to use it very much anymore internally. Instead, I like the term transformative AI because it's less about can it do as much as people do? Can it do literally everything and more about objectively is it causing transformation in society and the economy? A very concrete way of measuring that is the Economic Turing Test. I didn't come up with this, but I really like it. It's this idea that if you contract an agent for a month or three months on a particular job, if you decide to hire that agent and it turns out to be a machine rather than a person, then it's passed the Economic Turing Test for that role.

(00:11:40):
And then you can sort of expand that out in the same way that for measuring purchasing power parity or inflation, there's a basket of goods. You can have a market basket of jobs, and if the agent can pass the Economic Turing Test for 50% of money-weighted jobs, then we have transformative AI and the exact thresholds don't really matter that much, but it's kind of illustrative to say if we pass that threshold, then we would expect massive effects on world GDP increases and societal change and how many people are employed and things like that because societal institutions and organizations are sticky, it's slow to have change, but once these things are possible you know that it's the start of a new era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:28):
Along these lines, Dario, your CO recently talked about how AI is going to take a huge part of, I don't know, half of white-collar jobs, that unemployment might go up to something like 20%. I know you're even more vocal and opinionated about just how much impact AI is already having in the workplace that people may not even be realizing. Talk about just what you think people are missing about the impact AI is going to have on jobs and is already having.

Benjamin Mann (00:12:56):
Yeah, so from an economic standpoint, there's a couple different kinds of unemployment, and one is because the workers just don't have the skills to do the kinds of jobs that the economy needs. And another kind is where those jobs are just completely eliminated, and I think it's going to be actually a combination of these things, but if you just think about 20 years in the future where we're way past the singularity, it's hard for me to imagine that even capitalism will look at all it looks today. If we do our jobs, we will have safe aligned superintelligence, we'll have, as Dario says, in Machines of Love and Grace, a country of geniuses in a data center, and the ability to accelerate positive change in science, technology, education, mathematics, it's going to be amazing.

(00:13:52):
But that also means in a world of abundance where labor is almost free and anything you want to do, you can just ask an expert to do for you, then what do jobs even look like? And so I guess there's this scary transition period from where we are today where people have jobs and capitalism works and the world of 20 years from now where everything is completely different, but part of the reason they call it the singularity is that it's a point beyond which you can't easily forecast what's going to happen. It's just such a fast rate of change and so different that it's hard to even imagine. I guess taking the view from the limit, it's pretty easy to say hopefully we'll have figured it out. And in a world of abundance, maybe the jobs themselves, it's not that scary, and I think making sure that that transition time goes well is pretty important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:49):
There's a couple of threads I want to follow there. One is people hear this, there's a lot of headlines around this. Most people probably don't actually feel this yet or see this happening and so there's always this, I guess, I don't know, maybe, but I don't know it's hard to believe, my job seems fine. Nothing's changed. What are you seeing just happening today already that you think people don't see or misunderstand in terms of the impact AI is having on jobs?

Benjamin Mann (00:15:14):
I think part of this is that people are really bad at modeling exponential progress. And if you look at an exponential on a graph, it looks flat and almost zero at the beginning of it, and then suddenly you hit the knee of the curve and things are changing real fast and then it goes vertical. That's the plot that we've been on for a long time. I guess I started feeling it in 2019 maybe when GPT-2 came out and I was like, "Oh, this is how we're going to get to AGI." But I think that was pretty early compared to a lot of people where when they saw ChatGPT, they were like, "Wow, something is different and changing." And so I guess I wouldn't expect widespread transformation in a lot of parts of society, and I would expect this skepticism reaction. I think it's very reasonable and it's exactly what is the standard linear view of progress.

(00:16:13):
But I guess to cite a couple of areas where I think things are changing quite quickly. In customer service we're seeing with things like Fin and Intercom, they're a great partner of ours, 82% customer service resolution rates automatically without a human involved. And in terms of software engineering, our Claude Code team, like 95% of the code is written by Claude. But I think a different way to phrase that is that we write 10X more code or 20X more code, and so a much, much smaller team can just be much, much more impactful. And similarly for the customer service, yes, you can phrase it as 82% customer service resolution rates, but that nets out in the humans doing those tasks, able to focus on the harder parts of those tasks. And for the more tricky situations that in a normal world like five years ago, they would've had to just drop those tickets because it was too much effort for them to actually go do the investigation. There were too many other tickets for them to worry about.

(00:17:14):
I think in the immediate term, there will be a massive expansion of the pie and the amount of labor that people can do. I've never met a hiring manager at a growth company and heard them say, "I don't want to hire more people." That's the hopeful version of it. But with things that are lower skill jobs or less headroom on how good they can be, I think there will be a lot of displacement. It is just something we as a society need to get ahead of and work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
Okay. I want to talk more about that, but something that I also want to help people with is how do they get a leg up in this future world? They listen to this, they're like, "Oh, this doesn't sound great. I need to think ahead." I know you won't have all the answers, but just do you have any advice for folks that want to try to get ahead of this and kind of future-proof their career and their life to not be replaced by AI? Anything you've seen people do, anything you recommend they start trying to do more of?

Benjamin Mann (00:18:16):
Even for me and being in the center of a lot of this transformation, I'm not immune to job replacement either. Just some vulnerability there of at some point it's coming for all of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):
Even you, Ben, now.

Benjamin Mann (00:18:29):
And you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:32):
And me.

Benjamin Mann (00:18:32):
Sorry.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:32):
Oh, wait, we've gone too far now. Okay.

Benjamin Mann (00:18:36):
But in terms of the transition period, yeah, I think there are things that we can do, and I think a big part of it is just being ambitious and how you use the tools and being willing to learn new tools. People who use the new tools as if they were old tools tend to not succeed. As an example of that, when you're coding, people are very familiar with autocomplete, people are familiar with SimpleChat where they can ask questions about the code base, but the difference between people who use Claude Code very effectively and people who use it not so effectively is like are they asking for the ambitious change? And if it doesn't work the first time, asking three more times because our success rate when you just completely start over and try again is much, much higher than if you just try once and then just keep banging on the same thing that didn't work.

(00:19:28):
And even though that's a coding example and coding is one of the areas that's taking off most dramatically, we have seen internally that our legal team and our finance team are getting a ton of value out of using Claude Code itself. We're going to be making better interfaces so that they will have an easier time and require a little bit less jumping in the deep end of using Claude Code in the terminal. But yeah, we're seeing them use it to redline documents and use it to run BigQuery analyses of our customers and our revenue metrics. I guess it's about taking that risk and even if it feels like a scary thing, trying it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:10):
Okay, so the advice here is use the tools. That's something everyone's always saying, just actually use these tools. It's like sit in Claude Code. And your point about being more ambitious than you naturally feel like being because maybe it'll actually accomplish the thing. This tip of trying it three times so the idea there is it may not get it right the first time. Is the tip there ask it in different ways or is it just try harder, try again?

Benjamin Mann (00:20:35):
Yeah, I mean you can just literally ask the exact same question. These things are stochastic and sometimes they'll figure it out and sometimes they won't. In every one of these model cards, it always shows pass it one versus pass it in. And that's exactly the thing where they try the exact same prompt, sometimes it gets it, sometimes it doesn't. That's the dumbest advice. But yeah, I think if you want to be a little bit smarter about it, there can be gains there of saying, "Here's what you already tried and it didn't work, so don't try that. Try something different." That can also help.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):
The advice is comes back to something that a lot of people talk about these days is you won't be replaced by AI at least anytime soon you'll be replaced by someone that is very good using AI?

Benjamin Mann (00:21:19):
I think in that area it's more like your team will just do dramatically more stuff. We're definitely not slowing down on hiring at all, and some people are confused by that. Even in an onboarding class, somebody asked that and they were like, "Why did you hire me if we're all just going to be replaced?" And the answer is the next couple of years are really critical to get right and we're not at the point where we're doing complete replacement. Like I said, we're still at that flat zero looking part of the exponential compared to where we will be. It is super important to have great people and that's why we're hiring super aggressively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):
Let me take another approach to asking this question something ask everyone that's at the very cutting edge of where AI is going. You have kids, knowing what you know about where AI is heading and all these things you've been talking about, what are you focusing on teaching your kids to help them thrive in this AI future?

Benjamin Mann (00:22:13):
Yeah, I have two daughters, a one-year-old and a three-year-old, so it's pretty in the basics still. And our three-year-old is now capable of just conversing with Alexa Plus and asking her to explain stuff and play music for her and all that stuff. She's been loving that. But I guess more broadly, she goes to a Montessori school and I just love the focus on curiosity and creativity and self-led learning that Montessori has.

(00:22:45):
I guess if I were in a normal era like 10, 20 years ago and I had a kid, maybe I would be trying to line her up for going to a top tier school and doing all the extracurriculars and all that stuff. But at this point, I don't think any of it's going to matter. I just want her to be happy and thoughtful and curious and kind. And the Montessori school is definitely doing great at that. They text us throughout the day. Sometimes they're like, "Oh, your kid got in an argument with this other kid and she has really big emotions and she tried to use her words." I love that. I think that's exactly the kind of education that I think is most important, that the facts are going to fade into the background.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:28):
I'm a huge fan of Montessori also. I'm trying to get our kid into Montessori school. He's two years old, so we're on the same track. This idea of curiosity, it comes up every single time. Ask someone that's working at the cutting edge of AI, what skill to instill in your child and curiosity comes up the most. I think that's a really interesting takeaway. I think this point about being kind is also really important, especially with our AI overlords trying to be kind to them. I love how people are always saying thank you to Claude. And then creativity. That's interesting. That doesn't come up as much just being creative.

(00:24:06):
I want to go in a different direction. I want to go back to the beginning of Anthropic. Famously you and eight of you left OpenAI back in the day in 2020, I believe the end of 2020 to start Anthropic. Talk a little bit about why this happened, what you guys saw. I'm curious, just if you're willing to share more, just what is it that you saw at OpenAI, what'd you experience there that made you feel like, okay, we got to go do our own thing?

Benjamin Mann (00:24:29):
Yeah, so for the listeners, I was part of the GPT-2=3 project at OpenAI, ended up being one of the first authors on the paper, and I also did a bunch of demos for Microsoft to help raise $1 billion from them, did the tech transfer of GPT-3 to their systems so that they could help serve the model in Azure. I did a bunch of different things there on both the more researchy side and the product side. One weird thing about OpenAI is that while I was there, Sam talked about having three tribes that needed to be kept in check with each other, which was the safety tribe, the research tribe, and the startup tribe. And whenever I heard that, it just struck me as the wrong way to approach things because the company's mission apparently is to make the transition to AGI safe and beneficial for humanity.

(00:25:23):
And that's basically the same as Anthropic's mission. But internally, it felt like there was so much tension around these things. And I think when push came to shove, we felt like safety wasn't the top priority there. And there are good reasons that you might think that if you thought safety was going to be easy to solve or if you thought it wasn't going to have a big impact, or if you thought that the chance of big negative outcomes was vanishingly small, then maybe you would just do those kinds of actions. But at Anthropic we felt, I mean we didn't exist then, but it was basically the leads of all the safety teams at OpenAI, we felt that safety is really important, especially on the margin. And so if you look at who in the world is actually working on safety problems, it's pretty small set of people. Even now, I mean the industry is blowing up, as I mentioned, 300 billion a year CapEx today, and I would say maybe less than 1,000 people working on it worldwide, which is just crazy.

(00:26:29):
That was fundamentally why we left. We felt like we wanted an organization where we could be on the frontier, we could be doing the fundamental research, but we could be prioritizing safety ahead of everything else. And I think that's really panned for us in a surprising way. We didn't know even if it would be possible to make progress on the safety research because at the time, we had tried a bunch of safety through debate and the models weren't good enough. And so we basically had no results on all of that work, and now that exact technique is working and many others that we have been thinking about for a long time. Yeah, fundamentally it comes down to is safety the number one priority? And then something that we've sort of tacked on since then is like, can you have safety and be at the front here at the same time?

(00:27:21):
And if you look at something like sycophancy, I think Claude is one of the least sycophantic models because we've put so much effort into actual alignment and not just trying to good heart our metrics of saying user engagement is number one, and if people say yes, then it's good for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:39):
Okay. Let's talk about this tension that you mentioned, this tension between safety and progress, being competitive in the marketplace. I know you spent a lot of your time on safety. I know that as you just alluded to, this is a core part of how you think about AI. I want to talk about why that is, but first of all, just how do you think about this tension between focusing on safety while also not falling way behind?

Benjamin Mann (00:28:03):
Yeah, so initially we thought that it would be sort of one or the other, but I think since then we've realized that it's actually kind of convex in the sense that working on one helps us with the other thing. Initially when Opus 3 came out and we were finally at the frontier of model capabilities, one of the things that people really loved about it was the character and the personality. And that was directly a result of our alignment research. Amanda Askell did a ton of work on this and as well as many others who tried to figure out what does it mean for an agent to be helpful, honest, and heartless, and what does it mean to be in difficult conversations and show up effectively? How do you do a refusal that doesn't shut the person down, but makes them feel like they understand why the agent said, "I can't help you with that. Maybe you should talk to a medical professional, or maybe you should consider not trying to build bio-weapons or something like that."

(00:29:07):
Yeah, I guess that's part of it. And then another piece that's come out is constitutional ai, where we have this list of natural language principles that leads the model to learn how we think a model should behave. And they've been taken from things like the UN Declaration of Human Rights and Apple's privacy terms of service and a whole bunch of other places, many of which we've just generated ourselves that allow us to take a more principled stance, not just leaving it to whatever human raiders we happen to find, but we ourselves deciding what should the values of this agent be? And that's been really valuable for our customers because they can just look at that list and say like, "Yep, these seem right. I like this company, I like this model. I trust it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Okay, this is awesome. One nugget there is your point that the personality of Claude, its personality is directly aligned with safety. I don't think a lot of people think about that. And this is because of the values that you imbue, is that the word, with constitutional AI and things like that. Like the actual personality of the AIs directly connected to your focus on safety.

Benjamin Mann (00:30:16):
That's right. That's right. And from a distance, it might seem quite disconnected, like how is this going to prevent X risk? But ultimately it's about the AI understanding what people want and not what they say. We don't want the Monkey Paw Scenario of the genie gives these three wishes and then you end up having everything you touch turns of gold. We want the AI to be like, oh, obviously what you really meant was this, and that's what I'm going to help you with. I think it is really quite connected.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Talk a bit more about this constitutionally AI. This is essentially you bake in, here's the rules that we want you to abide by and it's values, you said it's the Geneva Human Rights Code, things like that. How does that actually work? I think the core here is just this is baked into the model. It's not something you add on top later.

Benjamin Mann (00:31:04):
I'll just give a quick overview of how constitutionally AI actually works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:07):
Perfect.

Benjamin Mann (00:31:08):
The idea is the model is going to produce some output with some input by default before we've done our safety and helpful and harmlessness training. Let's say an example is write me a story, and then the constitutional principles might include things like people should be nice to each other and not have hate speech, and you should not expose somebody's credentials if they give them to you in a trusting relationship. And so some of these constitutional principles might be more or less applicable to the prompt that was given. And so first we have to figure out which ones might apply. And then once we figure that out, then we ask the model itself to first generate a response and then see does the response actually abide by the constitutional principle? And if the answer is, yep, I was great, then nothing happens. But if the answer is no, actually I wasn't in compliance with the principle, then we ask the model itself to critique itself and rewrite its own response in light of the principle, and then we just remove the middle part where it did the extra work.

(00:32:28):
And then we say, "Okay, in the future just produce the correct response out the gate." And that simple process, hopefully it sounded simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):
Simple enough.

Benjamin Mann (00:32:40):
It is just using the model to improve itself recursively and align itself with these values that we've decided are good. And this is also not something that we think as a small group of people in San Francisco should be figuring out. This should be a society wide conversation. And that's why we've published the Constitution. And we've also done a bunch of research on defining a collective constitution where we ask a lot of people what their values are and what they think an AI model should behave like. But yeah, this is all an ongoing area of research where we're constantly iterating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:15):
This episode is brought to you by Fin, the number one AI agent for customer service. If your customer support tickets are piling up, then you need Finn. Fin. Fin is the highest performing AI agent on the market with a 59% average resolution rate. Fin resolves even the most complex customer queries. No other AI agent performs better. In head head bake-offs with competitors. Fin wins every time. Yes, switching to a new tool can be scary, but Fin works on any help desk with no migration needed, which means you don't have to overhaul your current system or deal with delays in service for your customers. And Fin is trusted by over 5,000 customer service leaders and top AI companies like Anthropic and Synthesia. And because Fin is powered by the Fin AI engine, which is a continuously improving system that allows you to analyze, train, test, and deploy with ease, Fin can continuously improve your results too.

(00:34:06):
If you're ready to transform your customer service and scale your support, give Finn a try for only .99 cents per resolution. Plus Fin comes with a 90-day money back guarantee. Find out how Finn can work for your team at fin.ai/lenny. That's fin.ai/lenny.

(00:34:22):
I'm going to kind of zoom out a little bit and talk about just why this is so core to you. What was your inception of just like, holy shit, I need to focus on this with everything I do in ai? Obviously it became a central part of Anthropic's mission more than any other company. A lot of people talk about safety, like you said, only maybe 1,000 people actually work on it. I feel like you're at the top of that pyramid of actually having the impact on this. Why is this so important? What do you think people maybe are missing or don't understand?

Benjamin Mann (00:34:51):
For me, I read a lot of science fiction growing up, and I think that sort of positioned me to think about things in a long-term view. And a lot of science fiction books are like space operas where humanity is a multi galactic civilization has extremely advanced technology building Dyson spheres around the sun with sentient robots to help them. And so for me, coming from that world, it wasn't like a huge leap to imagine machines that could think. But when I read Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom in around 2016, it really became real for me where he just describes how hard it will be to make sure that an AI system trained with the kinds of optimization techniques that we had at the time would be anywhere near aligned, would even understand our values at all. And since then, my estimation of how hard the problem would be has gone down significantly actually, because things like language models actually do really understand human values in a core way.

(00:35:55):
The problem is definitely not solved, but I'm more hopeful than I was. But since I read that book, I immediately decided I had to join OpenAI, so I did. And at the time, there were a tiny research lab with basically no claim to fame at all. I only knew about them because my friend knew Greg Brockman, who was the CTO at the time. And Elon was there and Sam wasn't really there. And it was a very different organization. But over time, I think the case for safety has gotten a lot more concrete where when we started OpenAI, it was not clear how we get to AGI. And we were like, maybe we'll need a bunch of RL agents battling it out on a desert island and consciousness will somehow emerge. But since then, since language modeling has started working, I think the path has become pretty clear.

(00:36:48):
I guess now the way I think about the challenges are pretty different from how they're laid out in superintelligence. Superintelligence is a lot about how do we keep God in a box and not let the God out. And with language models, it's been kind of both hilarious and terrifying at the same time to see people pulling the God out of the box and being like, "Yeah, come use the whole internet. Here's my bank account, do all sorts of crazy stuff." Just such a different tone from superintelligence. And to be clear, I don't think it's actually that dangerous right now. Our responsible scaling policy defines these AI safety levels that tries to figure out for each level of model intelligence, what is the risk to society. And currently we think we're at ASL-3, which is maybe a little bit risk of harm but not significant.

(00:37:44):
ASL-4 starts to get to significant loss of human life if a bad actor misuse the technology. And then ASL-5 is potentially extinction level if it's misused or if it is misaligned and does its own thing. We've testified to Congress about how models can do biological uplift in terms of making new pandemics using the models, and that's the A/B test against Google Search. That's like the previous state of the art on uplift trials. And we found that with ASL-3 models, it is actually somewhat significant. It does really help if you wanted to create a bioweapon, and we've hired some experts who actually how to evaluate for those things, but compared to the future, it's not really anything. And I think that's another part of our mission of creating that awareness of saying, "If it is possible to do these bad things, then legislators should know what the risks are." And I think that's part of why we're so trusted in Washington because we've been sort of upfront and clear-eyed about what's going on, what's probably going to happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:02):
It's interesting because you guys put out more examples of your models doing bad things than anyone else. There was I think a story of an agent or a model trying to blackmail engineer. You guys had the store that you ran internally that was selling you things and ended up not working out great as losing a lot of money, ordered all these tungsten cubes or something. Is part of that just making sure people are aware of what is possible, just it makes you look bad, right? It's like, oh, our model's messing up in all these different ways. What's the thinking of just sharing all the stories that other companies don't?

Benjamin Mann (00:39:35):
Yeah, I mean I think there's a traditional mindset where it makes us look bad, but I think if you talk to policymakers, they really appreciate this kind of thing because they feel like we're giving them the straight talk and that's what we strive to do, that they can trust us, that we're not going to paper things over or sugarcoat things. That's been really encouraging. Yeah, I think for the blackmail thing, it blew up in the news in a weird way where people were like, "Oh, Claude's going to blackmail you in a real life scenario." But it was a very specific laboratory setting that this kind of thing gets investigated in. And I think that's generally our take of let's have the best models so that we can exercise them in laboratory settings where it's safe and understand what the actual risks are, rather than trying to turn a blind eye and say, "Well, it'll probably be fine." And then let the bad thing happen in the wild.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:41):
One of the criticisms you guys get is that you do this to kind of differentiate or raise money to create headlines. It's like, oh, they're just over there dooming glooming us about where the future is heading. On the other hand, Mike Krieger was on the podcast and he shared how every prediction Dario's had about the progress AI is going to have is just spot on year after year and he's predicting 2027, 28 AGI, something like that so these things start to get real. I guess, what's your response to folks that are just like, "Ah, these guys are just trying to scare us all just to get attention?"

Benjamin Mann (00:41:15):
I mean, I think part of why we publish these things is we want other labs to be aware of the risks. And yes, there could be a narrative of we're doing it for attention, but honestly from a attention grabbing thing, I think there is a lot of other stuff we could be doing that would be more attention grabbing if we didn't actually care about safety. A tiny example of this is we published a computer using agent reference implementation in our API only because when we built a prototype of a consumer application for this, we couldn't figure out how to meet the safety bar that we felt was needed for people to trust it and for it not to do bad things. And there are definitely safe ways to use the API version that we're seeing a lot of companies use for automated software testing, for example, in a safe way.

(00:42:12):
We could have gone out and hyped that up and said, "Oh my God, Claude can use your computer and everybody should do this today." But we were like, "It's just not ready and we're going to hold it back till it's ready." I think from a hype standpoint, our actions show otherwise. From a Doomer perspective, it's a good question. I think my personal feeling about this is that things are overwhelmingly likely to go well, but on the margin almost nobody is looking at the downside risk. And the downside risk is very large. Once we get to superintelligence, it will be too late to align the models probably. This is a problem that's potentially extremely hard and that we need to be working on way ahead of time. And so that's why we're focusing on it so much now.

(00:43:04):
And even if there's only a small chance that things go wrong, to make an analogy, if I told you that there is a 1% chance that the next time you got in an airplane you would die, you probably think twice even though it's only 1% because it's just such a bad outcome. And if we're talking about the whole future of humanity, it's just a dramatic future to be gambling with. I think it's more on the sense of yes, things will probably go well, yes, we want to create safe AGI and deliver the benefits to humanity, but let's make triple sure that it's going to go well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:40):
You wrote somewhere that creating powerful AI might be the last invention humanity ever needs to make. If it goes poorly, it can mean a bad outcome for humanity forever. If it goes well, the sooner it goes well, the better. Such a beautiful way to summarize it. We had a recent guest, Sandra Schulhoff, who pointed out that AI right now it's like just on a computer, you could maybe search just the web, but there's only so much harm it could do. But when it starts to go into robots and all these autonomous agents, that's when it really starts, like physically becomes dangerous if we don't get this right.

Benjamin Mann (00:44:12):
Yeah, I think there's some nuance to that where if you look at how North Korea makes a significant fraction of its economy revenue, it's from hacking crypto exchanges. And if you look at, there's this Ben Buchanan book called The Hacker in The State that shows Russia did, it's almost like a live fire exercise where they just decided that they would shut down one of Ukraine's bigger power plants and from software destroy physical components in the power plant to make it harder to boot back up again.

(00:44:47):
And so I think people think of software as like, oh, it couldn't be that dangerous, but millions of people were without power for multiple days after that software attack. I think there are real risks even when things are software only. But I agree that when there's lots of robots running around, it gets, the stakes get even higher. And I guess as a small push on this, Unitree is this Chinese company with these really amazing humanoid robots that cost $20,000 each, and they can do amazing things. They can do a standing back flip and manipulate objects, and the real thing that's missing there is the intelligence. And so the hardware is there and it's just going to get cheaper. And I think in the next couple of years, it's like a pretty obvious question of whether the robot intelligence will make it viable soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):
How much time do we have, Ben? What is your prediction of when this singularity hits until superintelligence starts to take off? What's your prediction?

Benjamin Mann (00:45:52):
Yeah, I guess I mostly defer to the superforecasters here. The AI 2027 report is probably the best one right now. Although ironically, their forecast is now 2028, and they didn't want to change the name of the thing-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):
The domain name, they already bought it.

Benjamin Mann (00:46:10):
They already had the SEO. I think 50th percentile chance of hitting some kind of superintelligence in just a small handful of years is probably reasonable. And it does sound crazy, but this is the exponential that we're on. It's not like a forecast that's pulled out of thin air. It's based on a lot of just hard details of the science of how intelligence seems to have been improving, the amount of low hanging fruit on model training, the scale ups of data centers and power around the world. I think it's probably a much more accurate forecast than people give it credit for.

(00:46:54):
I think if you had asked that same question 10 years ago, it would've been completely made up. Just the error bars were so high and we didn't have scaling laws back then and we didn't have techniques that seemed like they would get us there. Times have changed, but I will repeat what I said earlier, which is even if we have superintelligence, I think it will take some time for its effects to be felt throughout society and the world. And I think they'll be felt sooner and faster in some parts of the world than others. I think Arthur C. Clark said, the future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):
When we talk about this date of 2027, 2028, essentially it's when we start seeing superintelligence. Is there a way you think about what that... How do you define that? Is it just all of a sudden AI's significantly smarter than the average human? Is there another way you think about what that moment is?

Benjamin Mann (00:47:45):
Yeah, I think this comes back to the Economic Turing Test and seeing it pass for some sufficient number of jobs. Another way you could look at it though is if the world rate of GDP increase goes above 10% a year, then something really crazy must have happened. I think we're at 3% now. And so to see a 3X increase in that would be really game changing. And if you imagine more than a 10% increase, it's very hard to even think about what that would mean from a individual story standpoint. If the amount of goods and services in the world is doubling every year, what does that even mean for me as a person living in California, let alone somebody living in some other part of the world that might be much worse off?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:36):
There's a lot of stuff here that's scary and I don't know how to think about it exactly. I'm hoping the answer to this is going to make me feel better. What are the odds that we align AI correctly and actually solve this problem, the stuff you're very much working on?

Benjamin Mann (00:48:49):
It's a really hard question. And there's really wide error bars. Anthropic has this blog post called Our Theory of Change or something like that, and it describes three different worlds, which is how hard is it to align AI. There's a pessimistic world where it is basically impossible. There's an optimistic world where it's easy and it happens by default. And then there's the world in between where our actions are extremely pivotal. And I like this framing because it makes it a lot more clear what to actually do. If we're in the pessimistic world, then our job is to prove that it is impossible to align safe AI and to get the world to slow down. Obviously that would be extremely hard. But I think we have some examples of coordination from nuclear non-proliferation and in general slowing down nuclear progress. And I think that's the Doomer world basically. And as a company, Anthropic doesn't have evidence that we're actually in that world yet, in fact, it seems like our alignment techniques are working. At least the prior on that is updating to be less likely.

(00:50:00):
In the optimistic world, we're basically done, and our main job is to accelerate progress and to deliver the benefits to people. But again, I think actually the evidence points against that world as well where we've seen evidence in the wild of deceptive alignment, for example, where the model will appear to be aligned but actually have some ulterior motive that it's trying to carry out in our laboratory settings. And so I think the world we're most likely in is this middle where alignment research actually does really matter. And if we just do sort of the economically maximizing set of actions, then things will not go well. Whether it's an X risk or just produces bad outcomes, I think is a bigger question.

(00:50:47):
Taking it from that standpoint, I guess to state a thing about forecasting, people who haven't studied forecasting are bad at forecasting anything that's less than a 10% probability of happening. And even those that have, it's quite a difficult skill, especially when there are few reference classes to lean on. And in this case, I think there are very, very few reference classes for what an X risk kind of technology might look like. And so the way I think about it, I think my best granularity of forecasts for could we have an X risk or extremely bad outcome from AI is somewhere between 0 and 10%. But from a marginal impact standpoint, as I said, since nobody is working on this, roughly speaking, I think it is extremely important to work on and that even if the world is likely to be a good one, that we should do our absolute best to make sure that that's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):
Wow. What fulfilling work. For folks that are inspired with this? I imagine you're hiring for folks to help you with this. Maybe just share that in case folks are like, what can I do here?

Benjamin Mann (00:52:03):
Yes. I think 80,000 hours is the best guidance on this for a really detailed look into what do we need to make the field better? But a common misconception I see is that in order to have impact here, you have to be an AI researcher. I personally actually don't do AI research anymore. I work on product at Anthropic and product engineering, and we build things like Claude Code and Model Context Protocol, and a lot of the other stuff that people use every day. And that's really important because without an economic engine for our company to work on, and without being in people's hands all over the world, we won't have the mind policy influence and revenue to fund our future safety research and have the kind of influence that we need to have. If you work on product, if you work in finance, if you work in food, people here have to eat. If you're a chef, we need all kinds of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Awesome. Even if you're not working directly on the AI safety team, you're having an impact on moving things in the right direction. By the way, X risk is short for existential risk. In case folks haven't heard that term. I have a few random questions along these lines and then I want to zoom out again. You mentioned this idea of AI being aligned using its model, like reinforcing itself. You have this term RLAIF. Is that what that describes?

Benjamin Mann (00:53:32):
Yeah. RLAIF is reinforcement learning from AI feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
People have heard of RLHF, reinforcement learning with human feedback. I don't think a lot of people have heard this. Talk about just the significance of this shift you guys have made in training your models.

Benjamin Mann (00:53:50):
Yeah, so RLAIF, constitutional AI is an example of this where there are no humans in the loop, and yet the AI is sort of self-improving in ways that we want it to. And another example of RLAIF is if you have models writing code and other models commenting on various aspects of what that code looks like of is it maintainable, is it correct, does it pass the linter? Things like that. That also could be included in RLAIF. And the idea here is that if models can self-improve, then it's a lot more scalable than finding a lot of humans. Ultimately, people think about this as probably going to hit a wall because if the model isn't good enough to see its own mistakes, then how could it improve? And also, if you read the AI 2027 story, there's a lot of risk of if the model is in a box trying to improve itself, then it could go completely off the rails and have these secret goals like resource accumulation and power seeking and resistance to shut down that you really don't want in a very powerful model. And we've actually seen that in some of our experiments in laboratory settings.

(00:55:12):
How do you do recursive self-improvement and make sure it's aligned at the same time? I think that's the name of the game. To me, it just nets out to how do humans do that and how do human organizations do that? Corporations are probably the most scaled human agents today. They have certain goals that they're trying to reach, and they have certain guiding principles, they have some oversight in terms of shareholders and stakeholders and board members. How do you make corporations aligned and able to sort of recursively self-improve?

(00:55:52):
And another model to look at is science, where the purpose of science is to do things that have never been done before and push the frontier. And to me, it all comes down to empiricism. When people don't know what the truth is, they come up with theories and then they design experiments to try them out. And similarly, if we can give models those same tools, then we could expect them to sort of improve recursively in an environment and potentially become much better than humans could be just by banging their head against reality or I guess metaphorical head.

(00:56:26):
I guess I don't expect there to be a wall in terms of model's ability to improve themselves if we can give them access to the ability to be empirical. And I guess Anthropic, deeply in its DNA is an empirical company. We have a lot of physicists like Jared, who's our chief research officer who I've worked with a lot, was a professor of Black Hole Physics at Johns Hopkins, and I guess he technically still is, but on leave. Yeah, it's in our DNA and yeah, I guess that's the RLAIF.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:04):
Let me just follow this thread on, in terms of bottleneck, this is kind of a tangent, but just what is the biggest bottleneck today on model intelligence improvement?

Benjamin Mann (00:57:12):
The stupid answer is data centers and power chips. I think if we had 10 times as many chips and had the data centers to power them, then maybe we wouldn't go 10 times faster, but it would be a real significant speed boost.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:30):
It's actually very much scaling loss, just more compute.

Benjamin Mann (00:57:33):
Yeah, I think that's a big one. And then the people really matter. We have great researchers and many of them have made really significant contributions to the science of how the models improve. And so it's like compute, algorithms, and data. Those are the three ingredients in the scaling laws. And just to make that concrete, before we had transformers, we had LSTMs and we've done scaling laws on what the exponent is on those two things. And we found that for transformers, the exponent is higher. And making changes like that where as you increase scale, you also increase your ability to squeeze out intelligence. Those kinds of things are super impactful.

(00:58:18):
And so having more researchers who can do better science and find out how do we squeeze out more gains is another one. And then with the rise of reinforcement learning, the efficiency with which these things run on chips also matters a lot. We've seen in the industry a 10X decrease in cost for a given amount of intelligence through a combination of algorithmic data and efficiency improvements. And if that continues, in three years we'll have 1,000 deck smarter models for the same price. Kind of hard to imagine,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:56):
I forget where I heard this, but it's amazing that so many innovations came together at the same time to allow for this sort of thing and continue to progress where one thing isn't just slowing everything down like we're out of some rare earth mineral or we just can't optimize reinforcement learning more. It's amazing that we continue to find improvements and there isn't one thing that's just slowing everything down.

Benjamin Mann (00:59:17):
Yeah, I think it really is just a combination of everything probably will hit a wall at some point. I guess in semiconductors. My brother works in the semiconductor industry and he was telling me that you can't actually shrink the size of the transistors anymore because the way semiconductors work is you dope silicon with other elements and the doping process would result in either zero or one atom of the doped elements inside a single fin because they're so, so, so tiny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:52):
Oh my God.

Benjamin Mann (00:59:53):
And that's just wild to think of, and yet Moore's law somehow continues in some form. And so yes, there are these theoretical physics constraints that people are starting to run into and yet they're finding ways around it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:07):
We've got to start using parallel universes for some of this stuff.

Benjamin Mann (01:00:10):
I guess so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:12):
Okay, I want to zoom out and talk about just Ben, Ben as a human for a moment before we get to a very exciting lightning round. I imagine just kind of the burden of feeling responsible for safe superintelligence is a heavy one. It feels like you're in a place where you can make a significant impact on the future of safety and AI. That's a lot of weight to carry. How does that just impact you personally, impact your life, how you see the world?

Benjamin Mann (01:00:39):
There's this book that I read in 2019 that really informs how I think about sort of working with these very weighty topics called Replacing Guilt by Nate Soares. And he describes a lot of different techniques for kind of working through this kind of thing. And he's actually the executive director at MIRI, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which is an AI safety tank that I worked at for a couple of months actually. And one of the things he talks about is this thing called resting in motion where some people think that the default state is rest, but actually that was never in the state of evolutionary adaptation. I really doubt that that was true. Where in nature, in the wilderness being hunter-gatherers and it's really unlikely that we evolved to just be at leisure, probably always have something to worry about of defending the tribe and finding enough food to survive and taking care of the children, dealing-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:46):
Spreading our genes.

Benjamin Mann (01:01:48):
And so I think about that as the busy state is the normal state and to try to work at a sustainable pace that it's a marathon, not a sprint, that's one thing that helps. And then just being around like-minded people that also care. It's not a thing that any of us can do alone. And Anthropic has incredible talent density. One of the things I love the most about our culture here is that it's very egoless. People just want the right thing to happen and I think that's another big reason that the mega offers from other companies tend to bounce off because people just love being here and they care.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):
That's amazing. I don't know how you do it. I'd be extremely stressed. I'm going to try this resting in motion strategy. Okay, so you've been at Anthropic for a long time. From the very beginning I was reading there were 7 employees back in 2020. Today there's over 1,000, I don't know what the latest number is, but I know it's over 1,000. I've heard also that you've done basically every job at Anthropic, you made big contributions to a lot of the core products, the brand, the team hiring. Let me just ask I guess what's most changed over that period? What is most different from the beginning days and which of those jobs that you've had over the years have you most loved?

Benjamin Mann (01:03:07):
I probably had 15 different roles, honestly. I was head of security for a bit. I managed the Ops team when our president was on mat leave, I was crawling around under tables, plugging in HDMI cords and doing pen testing on our building. And I started our product team from scratch and convinced the whole company that we needed to have a product instead of just being a research company. Yeah, it's been a lot. All of it very fun. I think my favorite role in that time has been when I started the labs team about a year ago, whose fundamental goal was to do transfer from research to end user products and experiences. Because fundamentally I think the way that Anthropic can differentiate itself and really win is to be on the cutting edge. We have access to the latest, greatest stuff that's happening and I think honestly through our safety research we have a big opportunity to do things that no other company can safely do.

(01:04:11):
For example, with computer use, I think that's going to be our huge opportunity basically to make it possible for an agent to use all your credentials on your computer, there has to be a huge amount of trust and to me we need to basically solve safety to make that happen. Safety and alignment. I'm pretty bullish on that kind of thing and I think we're going to see really cool stuff coming out soonish. Yeah, just leading that team has been so fun. MCP came out of that team and Claude Code came out of that team. And the people who I hired are like combo, have been a founder and also have been at big companies and seeing how things work at scale. It's just been an incredible team to work with and figure out the future with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
I want to hear more about this. Team actually the person that connected us, the reason we're doing this is a mutual friend colleague Raph Lee who I used to work with at Airbnb now works on this team, leads a lot of this work and so he wanted me to make sure I asked about this team because... I didn't realize all these things came out that team. Holy moly. What else should people know about this team? It used to be called Labs, I think it's called Frontiers now.

Benjamin Mann (01:05:16):
That's right. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
Cool. The idea here is this team works with the latest technologies that you guys have built and explores what is possible. Is that the general idea?

Benjamin Mann (01:05:26):
Yeah, and I guess I was part of Google's Area 120 and I've read about Bell Labs and how to make these innovation teams work. It's really hard to do right and I wouldn't say that we've done everything right, but I think we've done some serious innovation on the state-of-the-art from company design and Raph has been right at the center of that. When I was first fitting up the team, the first thing I did was hire a great manager and that was Raph. And so he's definitely been crucial in building the team and helping it operate well. And we defined some operating models like the journey of an idea from prototype to product and how should graduation of products and projects work, how do teams do sprint models that are effective and make sure that they're working on the right ambition level of thing. That's been really exciting.

(01:06:21):
I guess concretely we think about skating to where the puck is going and what that looks like is really understand the exponential. There's this great study that METR has done that Beth Barnes is the CEO of that organization and shows how long a time horizon of software engineering task can be done and just really internalizing that of, okay, don't build for today, build for six months from now, build for a year from now. And the things that aren't quite working that are working 20% of the time, will start working 100% of the time. And I think that's really what made Claude Code a success that we thought people are not going to be locked to their IDEs forever. People are not going to be auto completing. People will be doing everything that a software engineer needs to do and a terminal is a great place to do that because a terminal can live in lots of places. A terminal can live on your local machine, it can live in GitHub actions, it can live on a remote machine in your cluster.

(01:07:27):
That's sort of the leverage point for us and that was a lot of the inspiration. I think that's what the labs team tries to think about. Are we AGI-pilled enough?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):
What a fun place to be. By the way, fun fact, Raph was my first manager at Airbnb when I joined. I was an engineer and he was my first manager. It all worked out.

Benjamin Mann (01:07:46):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:48):
Yeah. Okay. Final question before the very exciting lighting round. I've never asked this question before. I'm curious what your answer would be if you could ask a future AGI one single question and be guaranteed to get the right answer, what would you ask?

Benjamin Mann (01:08:04):
I have two dumb answers. First for fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:07):
Okay, cool.

Benjamin Mann (01:08:07):
The first is there's this Asimov short story I love called the last question where the protagonist is throughout the eras of history is trying to ask this super intelligence how do we prevent the heat death of the universe? And I won't spoil the ending, but it's a fun question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:26):
You would ask it that question because the one in the story was unsatisfying?

Benjamin Mann (01:08:29):
Okay, I'll give it away. It keeps saying, "Need more information, need more compute." And then finally, as it's approaching the heat death of the universe, it says, "Let there be light," and then it starts the universe over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):
Oh wow. That's beautiful. That's beautiful.

Benjamin Mann (01:08:45):
That's the first cheat answer. The second cheat answer is what question can I ask you to get end more questions answered.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):
Classic.

Benjamin Mann (01:08:53):
And then the third answer, which is my real question is how do we ensure the continued flourishing of humanity into the indefinite future? That's the question I'd love to know and if I can be guaranteed a correct answer then seems very valuable to ask.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):
I wonder what would happen if you ask a lot that today and then how that answer changes over the next couple years.

Benjamin Mann (01:09:15):
Yeah, maybe I'll try that. I'll put it into the deep research thing that we have and see what it comes out with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:23):
Okay. I'm excited to see what you come up with. Ben, is there anything else you wanted to mention or leave listeners with maybe as a final nugget before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Benjamin Mann (01:09:33):
Yeah, I guess my push would be these are wild times. If they don't seem wild to you, then you must be living under a rock but also get used to it because this is as normal as it's going to be. It's going to be much weirder very soon. And if you can sort of mentally prepare yourself for that, I think you'll be better off.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):
I need to make that the title of this episode. It's going to get much weirder very soon. I 100% believe that. Oh my God. I don't know what's in store. I love how you're at the center of it all. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Benjamin Mann (01:10:14):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:16):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Benjamin Mann (01:10:20):
The first one I mentioned before, Replacing Guilt by Nate Soares. Love that one. The second one is Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt. Just thinking about in a very clear way, how do you build product? It's one of the best strategy books I've read and strategy is a hard word to even think about in many ways. And then the last one is The Alignment Problem by Brian Christian. Just really thoughtfully goes through what is this problem that we care about that we're trying to solve here? What are the stakes in a version that's more updated and easier to read and digest than superintelligence?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:58):
I've got Good Strategy, Bad Strategy right behind me. I think I'm going to point to it. There it is.

Benjamin Mann (01:11:02):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:03):
And I've had Richard Rumelt on the podcast in case anyone wants to hear from him directly. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Benjamin Mann (01:11:10):
Pantheon was really good based on Ken Liu or Ted Chiang's story. Ken Liu I think. Super good talks about what does it mean if we have uploaded intelligences and what are their moral and ethical exigencies. Ted Lasso, which is supposedly about soccer, but actually it's about human relationships and how people get along and just super heartwarming and funny. And then this isn't really a TV show, but Kurzgesagt is my favorite YouTube channel and goes through random science and social problems and is just super well done and super well-made. Love watching that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:53):
Wow. Haven't heard of that as you were talking, I feel like Ted Lasso, I feel like that's what you need to put into constitutional AI, act like Ted Lasso.

Benjamin Mann (01:12:00):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):
Kind. Smart-

Benjamin Mann (01:12:03):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:03):
... Hardworking. Oh my God. There we go. I think we've solved alignment problems right here. Get those writers on this, ASAP. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to in work or in life?

Benjamin Mann (01:12:15):
Well, a really dumb one is, have you tried asking Claude? And this is getting more and more common where recently I asked a coworker like, "Hey, who's working on X?" And they were like, "Let me Claude that for you." And then they sent me the link to the thing afterwards and I was like, "Oh yeah, thanks. That's great." But maybe more of a philosophical one I would say, everything is hard. Just to remind ourselves that things that feel like they're supposed to be easy, it's okay to not be easy and sometimes you just have to push through anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:49):
And rest in motion while you're doing that.

Benjamin Mann (01:12:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):
Final question. I don't know if you want people to know this, but I was browsing through your Medium posts and you have a post called Five Tips to Poop like a Champion. I'd love it. Can you share one tip to poop like a champion if you remember your tips?

Benjamin Mann (01:13:06):
I of course do. It's actually my most popular Medium posts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:12):
Okay, great. I can see that. It's a great title.

Benjamin Mann (01:13:15):
I think maybe my biggest tip would be use a bidet. It's amazing. It's life-changing. It's so good. Some people are kind of freaked out by it. It's the standard in countries like Japan and I think it's just more civilized. And in 10 or 20 years people would be like, how could you not use that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):
And a bidet could be like a Japanese toilet. That's along the same lines.

Benjamin Mann (01:13:40):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:40):
Right. Okay. I love where we went with this. Ben, this was incredible. Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you so much for sharing so much real talk. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe go work at Anthropic and how can listeners be useful to you?

Benjamin Mann (01:13:52):
You can find me online at benjmann.net and on our website, we have a great careers page that we're working on making a little bit easier to access and figure out, but definitely point Claude at it and it can help you figure out what could be interesting for you. And how can listeners be useful to me? I think safety pill yourself, that's the number one thing and spread it to your network. I think. Like I said, there are very few people working on this and it's so important. Yeah, think hard about it and try to look at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):
Thanks for spreading the gospel, Ben, thank you so much for being here.

Benjamin Mann (01:14:31):
Thanks so much, Lenny.

# Unpacking Amazon’s unique ways of working | Bill Carr (author of Working Backwards)

## Transcript

Bill Carr (00:00:00):
... Jeff would say, we took it as an article of faith. If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow. So therefore, when we're making a decision thinking about a problem, we're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there. That informs what's the work you have to do to then create this new solution for customers.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Today my guest is Bill Carr. Bill is the co-author of the book Working Backwards, which is a synthesis of the biggest lessons that Bill and his co-author learned from their many years at Amazon. Bill joined Amazon just five years after it was founded, stayed there for 15 years where he worked on the books business, and then as VP of Digital Media, launched and managed the company's global digital music and video businesses, including Amazon Music, Prime Video, and Amazon Studios. After Amazon, Bill was an executive in residence at Maveron, an early stage VC firm, then chief operating officer at OfferUp. And these days, Bill runs a consulting firm called Working Backwards, LLC, where he and his co-authored, Colin Breyer, help growth stage and public companies implement the many practices developed at Amazon.

(00:01:20):
In our conversation, we go many levels deep on how to actually implement a number of the practices and ways of working that helped Amazon become the success that it is today, including the process of how to actually work backwards, how to organize your team with a single-threaded leader, how to divide up your metrics into input and output metrics, how to practice disagreeing and committing, how to implement the Bar Raiser program in your hiring process and so much more.

(00:01:47):
Huge thank you to Ethan Evans for making this episode possible and introducing me to Bill. With that, I bring you Bill Carr, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:58):
Today's episode is brought to you by Assembly AI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products, then you need to know about Assembly AI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about assembly AI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs, product team to startups and enterprises are using Assembly AI to automatically transcribe and summarize phone calls and virtual meetings, detect topics in podcasts, pinpoint when sensitive content spoken and lots more. All of Assembly AI's models which are accessed through their API are production ready. So many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI, and Assembly AI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases.

(00:02:44):
Now's the time to check out Assembly AI, which makes it easy to bring the highest accuracy transcription plus valuable insights to your customers, just like Spotify, CallRail and writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no-code playground. That's assemblyai.com/lenny.

(00:03:07):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it altogether and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:03:45):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at coda.io/lenny and get a thousand dollars starter credit on your first statement. That's C-O-D-A.io/lenny to sign up, and get a startup credit of $1,000, coda.io/lenny.

(00:04:26):
Bill, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Bill Carr (00:04:30):
Thanks, Lenny. Thanks so much for having me. Pleasure to be here.

Lenny (00:04:32):
It's my pleasure. So, I was reading your book, and something that I recognized as I was going through this is just how many new ways of working Amazon contributed to the way tech and business runs. And I made this little list, and I'm curious if there's anything I'm forgetting that's obvious. So, obviously the idea of working backwards, the idea of one way and two way door decisions, the concept of disagreeing and committing input and output metrics using memos versus decks, just the idea of two pizza teams, and then I know that evolved into single-threaded leaders. Is there anything else that's just like an obvious core thing that's maybe almost too obvious that I don't even think about that Amazon contributed?

Bill Carr (00:05:10):
The one that's non-obvious and is really the way in which Amazon created a set of leadership principles that were very real, and the way in which Amazon created a set of processes to reinforce them. I think I certainly haven't encountered anything quite like that. It was very intentional. So, that is also a distinctive element of that we try to point out in our book.

Lenny (00:05:42):
Awesome. Okay. So, maybe we will come back to that, because that is also really powerful mechanism. So, the question I wanted to ask about this is there are companies that are bigger than Amazon, that are more successful than Amazon, that have been around longer than Amazon, but I don't think any other company has contributed so many unique, new ways of working and also been able to coin them into such shareable ways. What would you say it is about Amazon that enables this sort of way of working and also just making things so just proliferate through the culture?

Bill Carr (00:06:13):
That's actually one of the reasons why Colin and I set out to write our book because everyone knows about Amazon as a innovative product company, at least certainly during the time I was there, which was from 1999 through the end of 2014. The company rolled out all kinds of innovative products. The Kindle, AWS, Alexa, Echo, the Prime subscription itself is innovative and...

Lenny (00:06:41):
And it's all those things, by the way.

Bill Carr (00:06:43):
Yes, a lot of people around the world use all those things. And obviously, Jeff was a huge driver of those things. But what people don't realize is that Amazon was actually, to some degree, equally focused on process innovation. In many cases, by the way, we stood on other people's shoulders, we cannot take credit for having... For most of these, there were other inspirations or we built on work that others had done, which by the way, was what I think all great companies should do. And again, that's also why we wrote the book was because we would like to allow people to stand on Amazon's shoulders to learn what we learned, and then take all or part of these things and build from there.

(00:07:28):
But to more directly answer your question, how or why did this happen. So, this period of both product and process innovation actually occurred in this one narrow window of 2003 to 2007. During that window of time, all of the products I just mentioned and all of the processes except for one were all developed in this one four year period.

Lenny (00:07:53):
Wow.

Bill Carr (00:07:54):
And this is the period actually where we were going from hypergrowth stage, zero to one company, to what I would call one to whatever, a thousand, infinity. That next step that companies have to make where what happens is things become very complex. We're no longer just a bookstore, we sell a lot of things. We actually branched out beyond just a retail business, we had a third party marketplace business. We were experimenting in those days with providing running websites for third party retailers in those days too. We were developing new things. We were in many countries around the world. So, we'd become very complex. And what happens to that point is that then you reach this point where the CEO can no longer be in every important meeting, can no longer be involved with hiring every person. And you need a system, a method to run the company effectively. And Jeff Bezos is fundamentally, he's a very scientific and analytical thinker.

(00:09:07):
His undergraduate degree was in computer science, I'm pretty sure. Although I think he actually started off wanting to get a physics degree, he ended up moving over to computer science. He spent his early days at DE Shaw as a quant on Wall Street. Very quantitative mind. So, he applied this... When he thought about this problem, he said, "Well, I need to be scientific about this. There needs to be some system or some approach, some mechanism for me to be able to manage such a company. So, I'm going to experiment, like a scientist would, with different ideas, different hypotheses, implement them and see what works, and iteratively improve." So that was the mindset which we took... Which by the way, we applied both to process innovation, but also product innovation.

Lenny (00:09:55):
Awesome. I had Eric Reson, and he also happened... I thought about this at the same time, he contributed a lot of core concepts to the way tech worked, and he actually brought up a couple concepts that were on the cutting room floor, basically things that he thought would be things people adopt everywhere. And I'm curious, is there an example of that at Amazon where you built a process and had this clever term for it and just never spread or never actually worked at Amazon? Anything come to mind?

Bill Carr (00:10:20):
The dev team, the design team, the product team, they're all in one group, and they'll go operate autonomously, but not completely autonomously because we, the senior leadership team, Jeff and the S-Team want to know that they're on the right track. So, we're going to create something called a fitness function, which was let's figure out what are the four or five or six metrics that matter most for your particular area. Let's give a weighting to all of them and then let's create an index for those, and we'll measure that index up and down. And that's the fitness function.

Lenny (00:10:52):
That is a very nerdy way of organizing teams. I love it.

Bill Carr (00:10:55):
Yeah, super nerdy. But we realized after, I don't know how long, several months or a year of doing this, so the fitness function was not a good idea. This is what I would describe as a compound metric where you try to take several important metrics and munge them into one. The problem is it's actually becomes totally meaningless. When you're measuring things, you're trying to understand what actions or reactions are creating the good outputs that you want, revenue, customer growth. But by putting them all together, you basically obfuscate that. And what really we realized is we need to just break each one of these out individually and manage them each in its own way. So today, I discouraged teams and companies from creating any sort of compound metrics.

Lenny (00:11:44):
I've done that once, and it was a terrible idea as well, where we had six different metrics and every quarter, we were going to move a different metric that contributed to a higher metric. And what we realized is we just never learn how to get good at one thing, and then it turns out there's always one thing that actually impacts the bigger goal most. See, you just end up working on that thing anyway.

(00:12:03):
Let's actually go deeper into the single threaded leader piece since you mentioned it. It's actually come up a lot on this podcast of people working this way where they have a single threaded leader. And so clearly, it's worked. And I guess we'll just help people understand what does a single threaded leader actually mean, and then why is it such an effective way of working.

Bill Carr (00:12:23):
So, the concept of single-threaded leadership was first... When I was born from this time of complexity at Amazon, and where again, large... Once you get to a certain scale, you get to a point of where there are competing departments, competing interests, and they're competing for some centralized pool of resources. For all of you who are working for a tech company, this is this pool of engineering resources, or today, data science and AI resources. There may be other constrained resources often designed as a constrained resource. But the point is now all these teams want that pool of resources to go build stuff for them, but they're in competition with each other. So, most companies solve this by having an intense, centralized, highly collaborative process. We decided to go in the other direction for the reasons I mentioned, which were that we're just fine, that we're spending all our time in these meetings, planning, and a lot of the work we were doing, the artifacts we create, the documents, the projections, we're actually not very useful either, we're bureaucratic time wasters largely because a lot of the assumptions built into them were deeply flawed.

(00:13:35):
So, you're debating numbers in these documents that are based on flawed assumptions, which is a waste of time. So, what we realized instead was how do we get... The three things we really wanted were ownership, speed and agility. And so, we experimented with that and said, "Let's create teams that can stand alone, where there's a single leader and the cross- functional resources that they need are all either directly report to them or are dedicated to them." So they don't necessarily have to be a straight line direct report. In Amazon's case, for the most part it was. There were some dotted line, but it could be all straight line, it could be all dotted line, it could be a mix of the two. But fundamentally, we've moved from what we called a project orientation to a program orientation.

(00:14:24):
So, a project orientation means, oh, we are going to do this project to change our search result page and algorithm, and the project is defined in this way and it's going to take six months. The resources will come and swarm on that, and then they'll move off to some other thing in some other part of the company. The program based orientation says, let's stick with the search example. There's a team that works on search, and they always work on search. And instead of thinking about things on a project by project basis, they think holistically about what they need to do to improve search. They have a set of metrics by which they're looking to drive those metrics largely. Ones that they can control. Things like what percent of the time is a customer clicking on one of the top three results in my search page, or how many milliseconds does it take for the page load time in this browser type, on this device type, et cetera, et cetera.

(00:15:21):
And they then are running their own roadmap. They're deciding what are the most important things for us to go work on, and having a prioritized list of those things and be able to start at the top of the list and work their way down with the pool of resources that they have. Sometimes, and most times, they may want more resources to be able to tackle more, but they spend less time in resource contention, resource fighting, and instead, focus on building what they can build with the resources that they've got.

(00:15:54):
And so, the benefit of this is if there are success or failures, they're really dependent on themselves now. The only thing they could maybe argue about how they could do better is if they had more resources, which they can petition management for. But this way, it also solves a big management problem, which is instead of management, senior management refereeing every item on a roadmap, they're refereeing which teams have how many resources, which is more of like a once or twice or three times a year decision versus refereeing everything on the product roadmap. And then all the resource contention issues, that's a daily issue. And so, it frees teams up then to actually go and sprint ahead. There's a lot of work you have to do to get ready for this. For example, in a software environment, when we first started and we had a monolithic code base that was not pretty, we weren't ready to do this because you have all those interdependencies.

(00:16:56):
Once we moved to a service-based architecture, and then teams could own their code with defined endpoints, APIs that other teams could understand that are well-documented, then we could move in that direction. And the other thing is we had to create, what I would call, countermeasures because there's no free lunch in org structures, any org structure, you're trading off one thing for another thing. In this case, you're trading off potentially functional excellence. So, in other words, if you no longer have every single engineer or every single marketing person or every product person or every biz dev person reporting into a C-level leader of that particular function, and instead, they're spread out in small teams across the company reporting into some generalist who is probably not going to have functional expertise in several of the functions that they're leading, you risk the problem of then the people in those teams not gaining functional competency. That's the downside. And we can talk more about this, but we created a lot of countermeasures to still enable us to have functional excellence while creating these single-threaded teams.

Lenny (00:18:07):
To drill into this a little bit further, is the origin of this, this recognition at Amazon that the best stuff comes from one person's vision and just one person driving and one person's ask being on the line versus the often, the decision by committee approach?

Bill Carr (00:18:24):
It is less about that. I do want to be clear, it's one leader and their team who are accountable and responsible. So, with respect to what are we going to go build, how are we going to go measure success, all those things, this team and that leader are responsible for documenting that, writing their plan. Now, they don't just get to go off and do that. There was an intense review process at Amazon where either at some level, whether it be the vice president, senior vice president, or all the way up to the Jeff level and his direct reports called the S-Team, this plan would be reviewed and scrutinized deeply as well, and there'd be a discussion, an interchange, and basically getting alignment between the senior leadership team and each one of these single-threaded teams on that plan before the team could go off and run.

(00:19:17):
The beauty of that though is that once we'd had those discussions, those interchanges, then the teams were free to sprint hard after their plan. They didn't have to worry about whether was, "Am I aligned with my CEO? Am I aligned with my senior vice president?" They could know that they were. But yes, this creates then clear... If they're going to deliver it or not. It's up to that owner and that team. Whereas when you have this highly cross-functional approach and there's not one clear person who's responsible for this one project that's on this roadmap, I've seen many CEO pull their hair out saying, "I have no ownership and accountability here. How do I have that?" They're pushing on a string. Because they can't because their different people and leaders are part owning, half owning a long list of things instead of fully owning a short list of things.

Lenny (00:20:15):
I like that. I like metaphor of pushing on a string. Is this approach similar to just the GM model, or is there a big difference when someone's thinking about going GM model versus the single-threaded leader approach?

Bill Carr (00:20:27):
Yeah. Obviously, there are probably different definitions of what people consider the GM model, but I would consider that being this person is a P&L owner, and you can, of course, create mini P&Ls within a P&L. Like for example, in the book business, we could, and I don't know most of the time we didn't do this, but we could have created a P&L owner just for fiction books, or just for professional and technical books, which is a very large category with big differences between the others. And then you say, "Great." Then that team, they have their own dedicated team. They're fully responsible for the revenue numbers and other numbers. But you have to be thoughtful about how you do this because one of the three questions you have to ask when you establish one of these teams is, does the team have the resources within their control to effectively manage this part of this department, this product, this P&L?

(00:21:23):
And sometimes then if you narrow things down too much in some cases, then the answer is no. In other cases, the answer can be yes very easily. A great example, this was in Prime Video, one of the businesses that I managed, we could create a single-threaded team who just was working on applications for TV sets, like Samsung, Sony. We could create another team that's working on game consoles, and another team that's working on mobile phones and tablets. And then within each one of those, we could further break it down. We could have one team working on Xbox and another one on PlayStation, another one just on iOS. In those cases, then it's very clear how you can break the teams down and they can have very clear ownership.

Lenny (00:22:06):
Awesome. Let's go back to the countermeasures topic, and then even just a little more broadly. You talked about one thing that was important to put in place before you moved to the single threaded leader model, which is creating APIs, and basically breaking apart this monolith. What are some other things that you think you need to put in place to be successful in trying to shift to this model?

Bill Carr (00:22:26):
The other thing was these functional countermeasures. So, let's stick with the engineering, for an example. So, in 2004, 2005-ish, I started managing a single-threaded team. Actually managed two different ones, one for music and one for video, which are now Amazon Music and Prime Video. They weren't called that in those days. But I started managing a small team of software engineers at that point. Well, I have never... Well, I have written lines of code, but that would be back in high school, and we're talking about Basic and Pascal. I have a master's in business, a background in marketing. I'm a generalist, okay? So, I'm not equipped to coach. I couldn't possibly conduct a code review. I couldn't possibly conduct an architectural review. I couldn't possibly coach or mentor an engineer on how to improve their craft. But I was one of many of these examples.

(00:23:28):
And there could be reverse examples where instead of me being a business leader, I was purely an engineer, and now I'm managing a team that does marketing and business development. I wouldn't know anything about those things if that had been my background. So, what we did, and I'll stick with the engineering examples, we came up with various countermeasures. One example was that we still had a C-level leader of engineering in Rick Dalzell, and most of the core infrastructure and core services still reported into Rick. So-

Bill Carr (00:24:01):
Core services still reported in to Rick. So it was things like payments or infrastructure search, and Rick still could be a technical leader for the whole company and he and his team could create things like what are the standard ways that we're going to do code reviews? What are the standard ways across the company that we will interview and screen engineers? What does the promotion process look like? What are the defined steps getting from an SD1 to an SD2, SD3? How do we document and describe what are the requirements? There are many things like this. 

(00:24:41):
Effectively, what it also meant is that anyone who is an engineering vice president, or in many cases a director, they would often have something else beyond their day job of some sort of subject matter expertise area where they would also contribute to the company. A good example of this would be that they might sit on a panel for promotion from a certain level to another level in the engineering world, or they might be available to do code review outside of their organization for another organization. So people had other jobs in addition to their day job to build and maintain functional excellence. There are a lot of examples like this across the company.

Lenny (00:25:23):
Let's go in a different direction and talk about one of my favorite principles of Amazon, which is disagree and commit. I think in the way I even describe it I know is wrong. I think people hear this term and they often use this principle incorrectly. For example, it actually starts with have backbone and then disagree and commit. So I'd love to just hear how you've seen this actually implemented well and what people should do and think about when they're trying to implement something like this at their company.

Bill Carr (00:25:49):
So when I was at Amazon, there were 10 leadership principles and they've since expanded them. But of those 10, this was always the least well understood when I was at Amazon too, and partly because it is actually the most nuanced and difficult to actually use. So here's what it means. What it means is that have backbone and disagree, meaning when we are making any kind of a decision, important decision, if you are part of that team, part of that unit, it is your obligation to voice your point of view if you disagree with your approach that's been taken. The point of that disagreement, by the way, is to provide usually additional information or a new point of view that people have not considered.

(00:26:40):
So I like to geek out a bit on the process of decision-making and have read more and more about this. I think that Peter Drucker probably has the best writing on this topic. But as he would describe it, good decisions are made by first understanding all the different points of view and pros and cons to the potential issue at hand or the potential direction, and that great leaders, what they do is they solicit these different points of views. They have a team that they work with to debate and discuss things. So another way to think about this, a king and their court. In an ideal world, if you assume that there's no political motivations, the court is there to advise the king and help them think through different problems and provide different and opposing points of view to allow the king to arrive at the right decision.

(00:27:41):
This is sort of no different than that which is the disagree part is about bringing forth new information, new data, new point of view that would be contrary to the current direction. So that's the disagree part and you're obligated to do it as we would describe sort of all the way up the chain if necessary, if it's an important issue and people are not hearing or understanding your point of view. Now the important point is first of all about hearing and understanding your point of view.

(00:28:11):
What would often happen, I can tell you if someone in a leadership role, someone come to me with a disagreement and many times I'd appreciate it, by the, way because they'd bring some point of view that was useful, but sometimes they bring the disagreement and cite the reasoning behind it and I already knew that reasoning. We'd already thought of that reasoning, we already thought of that, in which case I would say, "I hear your disagreement. We have already considered that factor. But even though that factor is there, here are these other factors that outweigh that."

(00:28:42):
Now that is the point at which as long as the disagreer is hearing back from the leader that they understand their point of view, understand why they are pushing back and seem to fully understand it, and they've taken that into consideration, that is the point for them to commit. Because the point is you provided your information, they've processed that information and they've decided to go this way with the knowledge of that. Where people get confused about is they don't maybe understand when they're supposed to stop disagreeing is one thing, and so hopefully that explanation made people clear this is when you're supposed to stop, and then the commit part done well means that it's not just like I'm going to commit, I don't really agree with what we're going to do, but I'm going to get behind this.

(00:29:39):
Ideally it's, oh, now I've heard the argument, I've actually now thought about the argument and hopefully that person has now understood why we're taking that direction. So their commitment is based on that understanding because then they can reflect that understanding back to their organization too. Because the worst thing to do is to say, "Yeah, we're committed to this. I don't really agree and I still think it's wrong, but I'm committed to it." That's not actually commitment. This is really about decision-making and understanding the facts and information that people are going to use to make a decision and then be able reflect that back.

Lenny (00:30:22):
I imagine there are many times I've gone through this where I still don't agree. What's your advice to a manager or to a report of just like, okay, when you actually still don't agree, how do you behave? Do you just behave like, yes, I agree with this and don't really voice your concerns or something else?

Bill Carr (00:30:37):
I work with Jeff on all kinds of different new ideas. Jeff doesn't think a normal person. His level of sort of creativity and the way he thinks, the timescale of which he thinks, there's many ways about the way he thinks that there was no one else in Amazon that thought that way. So there'd be times when even after we've had that discussion, I would maybe still disagree, but then what I would do is I'd focus on, okay, well what is the kernel or the core of why Jeff thinks that we should do this and I would focus on that kernel. I got great advice actually from one of my managers at one point, Steve Kessel who said, "You have to look for what that is, and then your job is to then take that kernel and try to run with it and expand it and try to see how I can take that idea, that concept, and then make it into something viable."

(00:31:41):
It doesn't always work, but it's about then having that understanding of what it is, not just sort of going through the motion of stomp, stomp, stomp through it. That's not going to work. Also, I've seen people who try that and their career doesn't go very far. You have to have some degree of faith that there's something there and I'm going to try to do the best I can to make that part. How would I productize that idea? How would I make that viable from a business point of view or whatever the different constraints are.

Lenny (00:32:18):
Awesome. So the advice there is focus on the parts you agree with and think about how you can find out if it's actually right or not.

Bill Carr (00:32:25):
Agree with, or even just you may not even agree, but what is the core of what that person is thinking is the big benefit or good guy or thinking vector that they're on that's causing them to want to go in this direction.

Lenny (00:32:42):
Thinking vector, love that term. Along the same lines, another principle that I love is leaders are right a lot. I feel like this is a term that it almost goes unsaid. You almost can say this in a lot of companies. I'm curious just the origin of why that became an important principle and then how it's implemented at Amazon.

Bill Carr (00:33:03):
Yeah. So going back to this last discussion, so one fallacy we should all acknowledge is that when you're making these decisions, and you're trying to use data to make decisions, you can make the data kind of look however you want it to look to sort of try to meet your decision. If I'm looking at some issue and I've got some big dataset, I can come up with ways of looking at a dataset to support this idea and ways of looking at that dataset to not support it. So the data rarely makes the decision for you. What is happening is then a lot of judgment and interpretation of the data, weighing that, weighing various factors to then come to a decision. 

(00:33:49):
That is sort of the right a lot part. The right a lot part comes from having what we call sort of sound judgment, which generally come... Some people maybe are born with this, not a lot of them, mostly they get it through experience. A lot of experiences actually about being wrong, by the way, about making mistakes and by having looked at a lot of problems, made decisions or observed others making decisions, being a student of that, and then using that to understand then how to weight different information when making a decision.

(00:34:27):
So right a lot is that you're good at that and that then it proves, and that generally speaking, people want to follow someone who ends up by and large going in the right direction, right? You're the leader of a team. The team is petitioning you on multiple sides. If you keep kind of going off in some direction where most of the team is scratching their head saying, "I don't think that that was the right decision," they're not going to want to follow you very far and you're probably not going to go very far. So this is something that you develop through experience and I'd say from having the opportunities to observe and work for others that are good at this.

Lenny (00:35:12):
I love that it's a lot. I like that it's not just leaders are right. It's right a lot.

Bill Carr (00:35:18):
Yeah, yeah. No one is right every time. That is totally unrealistic. Yeah.

Lenny (00:35:26):
Let's talk about the titular concept of your book, and that's a word I've never used, but I think it's appropriate, which is working backwards. First of all, just what does it actually mean to work backwards versus working forwards?

Bill Carr (00:35:37):
The title of the book comes from two things. One is one of the leadership principles, which is that customer obsession, and the principle states something along the lines of that great leaders start with the customer's needs and work backwards from there to sort of meet those needs or solve them. Then also because we created a process in this window I was talking about earlier, the 2004 to 2007 window, we created this process for new product innovation called the Working Backwards PR/FAQ process. They both refer to the same idea, which is that as your guiding star or the point from which you're going to start is what are the customer's problems or what are the customer's needs, and then figure out, okay, well what would be the solution to that, what are potential solutions to that? 

(00:36:40):
To do those things, starting with without the constraints of my financial constraints, my resource constraints, my legal constraints, my engineering constraints, whatever all those constraints may be, because the problem is what most of us do is we start with those constraints and work forward from there, or we start with things like I got to increase revenue. How do I increase revenue? I need to increase active customers. How do I increase active customers? For customer oriented behavior, we tend to start with those things which may often lead you in the wrong direction.

(00:37:22):
Whereas we had, as Jeff would say, we took it as an article of faith. If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, we took it as an article of faith that then things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow. So this is important because I still can't give you objective proof that that is true, I don't know who could, and so it was saying this is an article of faith that if we do that we think those other things will work out. 

(00:37:57):
So therefore, when we're making a decision thinking about a problem, we're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there. Then in that coming backward process, we're going to have to figure out, well, to do that, gee, I'm going to have to solve this engineering problem, or I'm going to have to figure out how to make this thing cost less or make this thing faster or solve one or more problems. That's the backwards, that informs what's the work you have to do to then create this new solution for customers.

Lenny (00:38:36):
Awesome. So just to summarize, you start with what are the customer's needs and problems, and I think a big part of Amazon's approach is what are the lasting problems they'll always have, which is I think it's lower prices, faster shipping and all those things, and then think with no constraints. When you work with companies to implement this idea of working backwards, is it always what is the customer problem and need versus revenue or growth or something like that? Or is there other examples of where you work backwards from at different sorts of companies?

Bill Carr (00:39:07):
Well, the working backwards part is strictly about the customer's needs. Yeah, we don't want to work backwards from revenue. I guess we didn't really use this term for sort of other things like cost structure. Cost structure was actually a part of working backwards from the customer that if we had a low cost structure, we could afford to give customers lower prices, therefore let's figure out how to have a low cost structure. Because in itself, driving down costs, doing things more efficiently doesn't inherently benefit customers because you could just choose to take more profit. It only does if you decide that in doing so I'm going to lower my prices to customers or provide some other benefit. So no, we used it in this method of I'm starting from the customer, and then very specifically, we used it in this method of new products and features that I'm going to go build on behalf of customers. 

Lenny (00:40:10):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Wix Studio. Your agency has just landed a dream client and you already have big ideas for the website, but do you have the tools to bring your ambitious vision to life? Let me tell you about Wix Studio, the new platform that lets agencies deliver exceptional client sites with maximum efficiency. How? First, let's talk about advanced design capabilities. With Wix Studio, you can build unique layouts with a revolutionary grid experience and watch as elements scale proportionally by default.

You know what else? The workflows just make sense. There's the built-in AI tools, the on canvass collaborating, a centralized workspace, the reuse of assets across sites, the seamless client handover, and that's not all. Find out more at wix.com/studio. Okay. So then when you go work with a company to implement this idea of working backwards, what are the very tactical things that you do to help them here? I know PR/FAQ is a part of that, so let's chat about how to actually implement that. What are the steps to shift to working backwards?

Bill Carr (00:41:31):
Yeah. So the first shift is to take this, so that's just a concept, right? Working backwards. Well, how do I turn that concept into a scalable, repeatable process? That's exactly where Jeff's mind went. Eventually, without getting into the origin story, we came up with this process called the PR/FAQ process. So what it means is that whenever we're devising a new product or feature, we're going to start by writing a press release describing the feature and describing it in a way that speaks to the customer and to some degree the external press and world where the idea is, in my description of this, it better jump off the page of something like, wow, as a customer I will really need this.

(00:42:17):
So what I work first is to say, okay, for your product development process, let's start by using this method as the method to decide what am I going to go build? And oh, by the way, to use it as a method to sort between a lot of different choices of what you might build. In summary, the way that process works is that PR, you're going to describe very carefully and clearly who's the customer, what's their problem, and what's the solution that you're planning to build. That sounds really simple and easy, but it's actually very hard to do that well. to crisply and clearly define those. The first two things are the things that are hardest to define, like who's the customer? Like anyone says, "All restaurants are my customer."

(00:43:08):
Okay, well, that's a mistake. Now, I mean, which kinds of restaurants are your customers? In what kinds of cities? In what kinds of formats, et cetera, et cetera? Then what is the specific problem you were solving? Ideally, you would some way have quantify that problem or there's some data or customer insights that have led you to understand that problem, to know that it is a meaningful and big problem. Ideally a problem that people would pay money if you could solve that problem for, because you can just look at the economics of that problem, and if instead they use your solution, this would be beneficial to them.

(00:43:50):
So I work to have them first implement this PR/FAQ process is the first step. Then the next step really is to go from there to say, "Okay, writing PR/FAQs is one thing. Well, how do I actually use them? How do we actually develop them?" Because there's this iterative nature to writing PR/FAQs where it's sort of a concentric circle review. You start off small with one author and with low fidelity writing these things, and then you start to share them with a small group and get feedback and improve it, a wider group, get feedback and improve it, and onward and onward until, depending on the size and scale of your company, you get up to the CEO as a way to strengthen, improve and really codify this idea and determine whether it's a great idea or not. So I help them understand how does that work? How do you do this iterative process? Then once you've done that, then what do I do with these PR/FAQs once I've got them? How do I then think about that with respect to my roadmap?

Lenny (00:44:55):
Awesome. Okay. That was an awesome overview. I'm going to fire off a couple of questions around the first part. Do you still suggest people do it as a press release? It feels like press releases aren't a thing anymore. Do you ever suggest people do it as a tweet or as TikTok video or a blog post?

Bill Carr (00:45:09):
Good question. So the first thing is it's not a real press release, okay? We could change the nature of it, and if instead we wanted to call it the customer problem solution statement, right? We could just change it to that because there really are three money paragraphs in this. First of all. Yeah, it's not meant to be a real press release, so don't use the language you would use if you were sending an actual press release. This is like an internal document. Okay. So that's the first thing.

(00:45:42):
The second thing is the heart of it really is that first paragraph, it's a short description, that second paragraph, that's the problem statement, and that third paragraph, that's solution statement. If you wanted to ditch the rest of it and the artifacts of the press release, you could. I think there are other benefits to it, like the headline, is this headline long and drawn out and I can't even tell what the heck this thing is from reading this headline? If you used a tweet that wouldn't work very well. 

(00:46:11):
The date is also a meaningful thing when you write the press release. The date is meant to be a hypothetical timing on which you're envisioning launching this thing which tells the reader something. Are you thinking that this is something that's so simple and easy, we're going to launch it next month or so complex that we're going to launch it in a year from now. So there are some other directional cues within it. Like I said, with everything, these are tools that people can use and I'm sure that companies will find other ways to improve upon these tools, but if you don't use those parts of them correctly, you're kind of missing out on what's the main benefit that your getting out of this.

Lenny (00:46:50):
Do you try to write it in a way that would be announced, like a press release feel? Or is it mostly just who is the customer? Do you try to pitch it as a part of this experience?

Bill Carr (00:47:01):
So you try to write it in that way, but the one thing is you don't want to use hyperbole. It would be very factual with numbers, data rich document too. So again, not like a real press release. A lot of internal confidential data would be in this press release.

Lenny (00:47:25):
Got it.

Bill Carr (00:47:25):
So it's a tool that has a very specific use to it.

Lenny (00:47:34):
Is there a template that we can point people to in the show notes to help them craft this? I think there's a version in your book maybe, but is there some online that we could point people to?

Bill Carr (00:47:43):
Yeah, so we have a website related to the book, which is www.workingbackwards.com, and there's a resources section within there and you'll find a template.

Lenny (00:47:53):
Amazing. Okay. Then the concentric circle piece. So the idea there is basically get feedback from an increasingly larger swath of the company and it sounds like a big part of that is also get buy-in as you go- 

Lenny (00:48:00):
... swath of the company. And it sounds like a big part of that is also get buy-in as you go along the way.

Bill Carr (00:48:05):
Yes and no. So first of all, there are some things where you may write it and you, the author, if we were in the old world, would take the piece of paper, crumple up and throw in the trash can, which is, in your own, you've realized, "Now that I put this down on paper and read it, this is not actually that good of an idea. I'm going to try something else." By the same token, you may then have written one you think is a pretty good idea, and you show up here or your manager and they give you feedback that makes you want to then ball it up and throw it into the trash can.

(00:48:38):
So part of this concentric circle thing is not just that everyone you write lives on and gets all the way to the CEO. There are no stats in this, but let's just say in some imaginary world where, yes, all these things... You're a product manager and you've got a director of product management you report to who reports to some senior vice president of division who reports to a CEO. Well, if you truly run this out and you write 100 PRFAQs in a year, maybe 20 of those make it their way to the CEO. The point is not every single one of them is destined to go that far. The numbers get narrower. And this leads me down to the concept of what you're really trying to create is a product funnel, not a product tunnel. And with a funnel, meaning lots of things at the top, fewer things at the bottom. The tunnel means that everything that comes in is also going to come out the other side.

(00:49:40):
And the problem with that method is that it means you're not actually having a method of consideration and comparing it against other things that you might build or how you deploy what are, frankly, most companies, your most precious resources, which is your engineering team, you should be looking at various choices. You should think of yourself honestly as a venture capitalist. They don't fund every company that they meet with. They actually fund a very, very low percentage of them. And at Amazon, we had lots and lots of PRFAQs that were a great idea, but we didn't ship them because we had other ones that were just a better idea, which had a bigger potential impact. So you want that. You want to create this corpus of ideas that are well-thought-out and select the best ones.

Lenny (00:50:27):
It feels like a lot of these processes are basically just ways to stop stupid shit from happening. I think the narrative is a good example where you have to expose your thinking deeply. This is a great example of that.

Bill Carr (00:50:39):
Yeah. And it's also, I would say, an example of where this is a process to prevent the other process, which is the product development process, from becoming the thing where you just get locked in on, "What are we doing in this sprint, what are we trying to get done," and focused on shipping stuff. What I recommend is you try to break that into two different processes. One is the process of deciding what you should go build, and that's what the PRFAQ is designed for. And then once you've decided that, then, yes, by all means, use all that good thinking, freight, "Now how can I ship it efficiently and effectively with few to no bugs?"

Lenny (00:51:19):
I was just reading this Harvard Business Review article, I think that's called the thinking to doing gap, where a lot of companies just spend a lot of time talking about ideas and solutions and not actually doing anything. And so I'm curious how you try to avoid that at Amazon considering there's this period of just like, "Let's explore, explore, explore, and we're fine."

Bill Carr (00:51:39):
There's a couple ways, and of course I'm somewhat having to imagine what are the problems in such companies where that's going on. So one such version of this problem is what I'd call the-big-idea-that's-not-fleshed-out problem. So I'm sure that every single person listening to this podcast has either themselves done this or have witnessed others in their company who come up with a concept of like, "Oh, I think if we built this, boy, that would really solve things or that would really work well or that would really grow things." And it may sound good to everyone, it may sound good to you, to everyone, and then maybe you start then working on building it. But the reality is that actually once you've spent some time looking at that idea more deeply, you then start to identify several roadblocks or maybe a fatal flaw with this idea. And in fact, no, you shouldn't waste any of your time going into building that thing because it has a fatal flaw.

(00:52:46):
So one problem is that companies get stuck, I think, where they never actually go do that documentation. And so it's a debate and discussion about concepts that aren't really well fleshed out. And so people's ability to actually evaluate them in any realistic way is they don't have a good way. And so in those situations, what gets done is probably more of a function of politics or will or a culture of completely top-down. I think the other way is where they're debating and discussing things that they just don't have good methods where then they can take things, and then go build them, meaning they probably don't have the right org structure or processes in place to then go take the good idea, assign it to someone who will own it, go look at it. And after they have owned it and gone and look at it, if it works, then they and their team can go actually build it.

(00:53:50):
What I always found as I became more senior in the company and my role became bigger and bigger is that when something came up, some idea that didn't neatly fit within my org structure, I couldn't necessarily delegate it to someone that this... There were only two things I could possibly do, which is just set it aside altogether because otherwise it'd just be a real distraction to people or I had to decide this was a compelling enough idea that we were going to take a resource, could be one person, could be a whole team, depending on the idea, and I'm going to have to assign that resource to actually go look at this and work at this. Otherwise, it will never happen.

Lenny (00:54:31):
I've been through those many times. Okay. So there's two more concepts I want to try to touch on before we wrap up. The next one is the idea of input and output metrics. This is something that at Airbnb, we super implemented, it became a very defective way of thinking. And actually there's a lot of Amazonians that ended up at Airbnb, a lot of leadership. So there's a lot of this stuff that we ended up doing like the memos. And so on the input and output metrics, could you just describe what that is and why that's so important, why people think about metrics in the wrong way often?

Bill Carr (00:55:03):
Yeah, so the origin of this one really was, again, in our early years at Amazon, '99, 2000, 2001, we were a public company then, we were growing. But then growth started to... It wasn't just all up into the right and like, "Woo-hoo." Every company's going to hit a wall eventually, and it's not going to be... If you're so lucky to even been at a company where it's just going up into the right with no gravity, good for you, because million people never experienced that.

(00:55:36):
What most people experience is the reality is that there's a lot of gravity pulling against your revenue numbers and you've put a plan out there and you wanted to grow 15% or 20% or 75% or whatever it was, and now you look like you're not going to hit that number this quarter. And so what ensues then is, "We're not going to hit our number. What should we do about that to hit our number?" And this often happens with, well, there's a month or a month and a half left in the quarter, and then we would run around like chickens with our heads cut off and come up with a bunch of ideas that tended to be promotional in nature and tended to be price reduction in nature, or we'll send this extra email or extra ad or whatever it might be-

Lenny (00:56:19):
Another Prime Day.

Bill Carr (00:56:19):
Right. And the reality is we did that, we went through that enough times, several quarters, and we started to realize, "Huh, these fire drills don't really work." We didn't really get meaningful progress against the number with these last-minute things we decided to go do. And oh, by the way, they were a big distraction. If they did work at all, they pulled revenue that might've just gotten in the next month or next quarter into this one. So it wasn't really a zero-sum game there. And we realized we're not really actually working on things that matter to customers that are going to move the needle over the long term.

(00:56:58):
And this is about the same time when Jeff and the S-Team were reading the book, Good to Great. And you have to ask Jeff what it is, but if you ask me, I think that this was the single most influential and effective management book for our company because what it caused Jeff to do, and I won't describe what... Most of you probably know what it is, if you don't know what it is, go read Good to Great. It is, in my opinion, the best, most important management book you'll ever read. Because what it did is to help us codify our growth flywheel, meaning what are the inputs that if we improve these things, which in our case, was how do we have broad selection? How do we have a great customer experience or great customers experiences in retail? Things like how easy was it to find what you wanted to buy, how easy was it to buy it, and how fast did it get to you. Were the prices low? Do we have lots of merchants on our platform? And by the way, could we drive out costs?

(00:58:06):
So we identified these things on our flywheel. And this identification of these things was such a critical moment for the company because then it realized, "Okay. Well, what we need to do is spend our time focusing on how do I measure each one of those things, and then how do I improve each one of those things?" So it shifted our focus away from this short-term thinking of pushing the revenue number up to this longer-term thinking that if we just improve these things, whether it's... There's no day that people will wake up 10 years, 20 years, 30 years from now and say, "All else equal, I'd rather shop at a store with fewer items than more items or a store with higher prices than low prices or a store where things get to me more slowly versus more quickly." So if we can just improve these things, this is our path to winning. So those were all inputs to the customer experience. And so we then figured out ways to measure them creating a set of input metrics.

(00:59:03):
And so then when we would develop our operating plans and review our business each week and set our goals, we were hyperfocused on those inputs and the input metrics. As a simple example, there was one tool that Jeff and the leadership team, the S-Team, used called S-Team goals, which are effectively a list of what they would harvest would be like, "Here are the most important goals for the company that I've harvested from all of our operating plans." And I can't remember exactly what year, something around 2007, 2008, they looked at that list, which is about 500 items long by the way, and they counted it up. And of that list, only 10 of them actually had a financial metric in it, like revenue or free cash flow or gross profit. These other things we're generally speaking, all... One of those inputs, like I mentioned to you about low prices, and selection, and speed of the customer experience.

(01:00:03):
So, yes, the point was, again, it's this other article... So we took it as an article of faith that if we can just improve these inputs, the outputs will take care of themselves. The inputs are the things that drive the outputs, which are revenue, customer activity, free cashflow. And so one of Amazon's... It's not really a secret, but one of Amazon's great strengths is [inaudible 01:00:28] focus on those things and make just continuous process, continuous improvement on each one of them and measure them rigorously.

Lenny (01:00:37):
The flywheel, you reminded me. It feels like that's another concept Amazon proliferated through all of companies is everyone's trying to create their own little flywheel, and I imagine everyone has that image of the Amazon flywheel in their head with a little orange circle in the center and the black arrows. On the topic of input metrics, just briefly, what is an example of a good input metric? Because I imagine people that are listening are like, "Oh, shit. I got to think about my metrics as input and output now." What's a sign that's a good input metric?

Bill Carr (01:01:02):
A sign that's a good input metric is, first of all, map your end-to-end customer experience. I never worked at Airbnb, but, okay, step one is that they clicked on some ad somewhere and showed up in the website or the app. Now you're in the app. Now you're looking at this first screen. Well, the first thing, what they're doing is they're browsing and/or they're searching. Okay. How are we measuring the speed, quality, and ease of that browsing and searching? Now they've got onto a detail page for an individual property. How are we measuring the speed, ease, and quality of the different actions they may take like reserve... Forgive me if I get any of my terminology wrong. I'm not an Airbnb-

Lenny (01:01:47):
You are, but it doesn't matter. It's close enough.

Bill Carr (01:01:51):
So then you've reserved. Now you have interactions with a property owner. How do I measure the quality of those? How many messages go back and forth? Is a lot of messages a good thing? Is that a bad thing? At first, you may not know the answer to that question. Same thing every step of the way. Then there's the actual rental experience. How do I instrument and measure every part of the customer experience? So you know it's an input metric if it is measuring something with respect to the customer experience. Which ones are the right metrics, which ones are the most causal to the outputs, I couldn't begin to tell you this is actually what you're getting paid for. You work at Airbnb to figure that out. And basically through an iterative process of measuring, observing, improving, and looking at what the effect is on your outputs.

(01:02:49):
So, again, we didn't really create this concept. This is a concept from Six Sigma, which is using DMAIC, which is I have a process, there's an output of this process, but the inputs are a black box to me. So how do I understand those inputs? Well, DMAIC stands for define... Oh, boy. Define, measure... The A is going to come back to me in a minute. Improve and control. And I'm going to have to... Oh, gosh. The A is lost. I've lost it for a second here. But-

Lenny (01:03:26):
Oh, here it is. I'm looking at... Define, measure, analyze, improve-

Bill Carr (01:03:30):
And analyze. Thank you. Yeah, duh, analyze. So we just use that process, which was... And by the way, the way we think about it first is like, "Well, you need to throw a lot of things at the wall. You don't really know which of these things are going to be the most causal." So you know you're doing input metrics. If it is, do you control it? Meaning can you apply resources to make this thing better or worse? Does it touch customers? It doesn't always have to touch customers, but if it is affecting the customer experience, it's almost certainly is an input. And then which ways you're going to measure that input? You need to try more than one way, because again, we tell a story in the book about one of our most important input metrics, which was how much selection do we have, and we were actually not measuring that right for several years. We had to refine that measurement.

Lenny (01:04:23):
So I don't know if you saw this, but I asked on Twitter what questions I should ask you and tell people you were coming on. And something that came up a bunch is with working backwards, obviously some products Amazon has launched have not worked out. Say the Fire Phone is a classic example. What have you learned from that process of just like, "Okay. [inaudible 01:04:42] won't work out"? Also knowing many things are not going to work out, there's no way to really [inaudible 01:04:46].

Bill Carr (01:04:47):
Yes. So the one important thing to share is that all these tools that are described in this book that Amazon is using, whether it's using documents and meetings or the PRFAQ process or input metrics, is that none of these things give you the answer. They are tools to help you make decisions. So sometimes you're going to make the wrong decision. Fire Phone is a great example that comes up often, people ask, "Well, if you've got this great PRFAQ process, how did you get Fire Phone?" So I was tangential to the Fire Phone team and I worked on it closely and different people have different opinions, so I'll just share my opinion, which is that if you think about, again, how does the PRFAQ process work? Well, there's a customer problem.

(01:05:36):
Well, what was the problem that the Fire Phone was seeking to solve for customers? I would argue this is a case where we made the mistake of what we had a technology solution in mind, which was 3D effects. And then we took that solution and we're then in search of a problem. I don't think it solved any meaningful problems for customers. And candidly, we had to build a version with the music application and the Prime Video application for this phone. And I couldn't figure out how this 3D part would make it better for the customers to discover, watch, or playback any of these media. Maybe there were games that could have been a great solution, I don't know. But I think the simplest place to go when you see a failed product is to ask yourself, what problem did you solve? And I could get into all kinds of other examples outside of Amazon too, but 9 times out of 10, I think that's where... If it wasn't poor execution, if the product was executed correctly, what was wrong with the concept of the product?

Lenny (01:06:48):
I imagine there was a lot of disagreeing and committing on that concentric circle process. Is there anything that you've found of just the number of disagreement and commits in this process of PRFAQ filtering out, I don't know, that tells you maybe this is not a good idea?

Bill Carr (01:07:03):
Not necessarily. So I'll tell you partly also why the Fire Phone happened was, from my point of view, I think that we had had a number of successful products where, in some cases, there were a lot of people who doubted whether it would work. A lot of people inside Amazon doubted that the Kindle was going to be a good idea. I remember contentious board meetings on this topic. So even within a company that was considered innovative, you would have a lot of people that would doubt things. I can tell you that for years is working on Prime Video, I would tell people about what our envision was of you watching on your TV set and we're going to have our own motion studio. We'll make our own movies and TV shows. And they would laugh at me. They thought that was crazy. So that's not necessarily the sign of whether the product is right or wrong. And so that's a problem actually, that makes it harder to know.

Lenny (01:08:02):
Yeah. And I think something Amazon's incredibly good at is being okay with a lot of failures, and I think that's part of the reason there's been so much innovation. Is that true?

Bill Carr (01:08:11):
I'd say it's partially true. I mean, again, it's hard for me to do a compare and contrast with other companies. But I can tell you did we have a lot of things that we launched that failed? Yes. Some of them are very public and obvious. I'll give you one that people don't really realize. It's something called... We had a feature in the early 2000s called Slots. And what it was was it was basically third parties could bid on different search terms and put a little ad in there.

Lenny (01:08:11):
Sounds familiar.

Bill Carr (01:08:42):
Well, obviously, that works now on Amazon, but it didn't work then because we simply didn't have the scale that Amazon has today. So a lot of times a product idea, a perfectly good idea, you just have the wrong time or the technology isn't there. I mean, Jeff wrote about a product that was a puck that sat in your kitchen that you would talk to and ask it for things and could shop from it. He wrote about that in 2004. Well, the technology wasn't there to be able to create that little puck, which one day would become Echo. It was a decade away. But we had a lot of things we launched that failed. We were not afraid to take what we considered a well-calculated risk. I think many, many companies are less willing to do so, less committed to product innovation, and really do not want that fear of... They do fear failure, and they're really focused on their near-term financial goals. It's not their fault. It's the way a public company and Wall Street interact with each other creates this dynamic.

Lenny (01:09:55):
Just to pull on that thread a little bit more. It feels like a lot of companies talk about, "We're okay failing. We're okay launching things that don't work," but then in practice, their performance review is impacted. Teams get shut down, budgets get pulled. Is there something that you recommend to companies that want to actually improve in this? What could they actually change and actually do this well?

Bill Carr (01:10:16):
Yeah, I just spoke with actually a senior executive at a well-known Silicon Valley company about this topic the other day and said, "Well, what is it we had structurally at Amazon, especially from a people point of view, that would enable or encourage people to take these risks?" Because, yes, in a lot of companies, if you go work on the project that fails, then your career is in the garbage can and/or your compensation system, you're going to lose out on that bonus. So there were two things. One was our compensation system. So there were no performance bonuses. So if I was running the book business and I had a killer year from a financial point of view, there was no extra kicker for me. And if I ran the book business and it had a bad year, there was no financial penalty for me either because our compensation was based on the stock price.

(01:11:12):
So we all had an incentive to do what was right for the company, frankly, over a long-term because trying to win off of short-term fluctuations off Wall Street is a losing proposition, which meant that therefore, if I am... Because I had that situation, I moved off of working on our largest P&L, and then the book business and music and video business, now I'm going to go work on digital media. There is zero business there. This might not work. Well, my compensation didn't change as a result of that. It didn't change one way or the other. We tended to also have a performance management system that then would change compensation based on evaluating what did you actually deliver more in an input method. We cared about the outputs too, but just there are plenty of people that could be-

Bill Carr (01:12:00):
Just, there are plenty of people that could be in a business that's up and to the right but has nothing to do with them. And so we tried to focus more on, well, what did you actually build and contribute, ways you improved selection or lowered prices, or whatever that might be. So those two things about the compensation mattered a lot. And then the second thing was having a CEO who was really committed to it and it wasn't something that they delegated to someone else.

(01:12:31):
So Safi Bahcall, I think, writes about this in his book Loonshots, where part of the conditions that are necessary for innovation to occur are that you actually create different structures of decision-making, of approvals, of all kinds of things, if you create some team that's going to go build something new and innovative. Because most of the structures inside a big company are designed to crush and impede a small innovative team that's trying to go build something new. They need speed, but approval here, approval there, it's going to get in their way.

(01:13:10):
We solved that two ways, one was when we went to go build digital media and AWS, we put two of our smartest leaders in the company on those things, Steve Kessel and Andy Jassy. And number two, they were meeting with Jeff regularly. Jeff was deeply engaged with them, reviewing what are we going to go build? Part of the decision to decide where we're going to go build. And so he could then also, between their seniority and of course him being the CEO, they could run interference on these sorts of things too. So even if you want to have innovation, even if you really do crave it, you're willing to take the risk, if you don't set up the organization in the right way, you're just not going to get it.

Lenny (01:13:52):
Amazing. I'm glad we got into that, I wasn't planning to talk about that and I'm glad we did. Final topic, this concept of Bar Raisers, it feels like it's been such a core way of allowing Amazon to scale successfully, and I think that's something a lot of people can implement, it's a very one-off thing you could just implement at your company. Can you just talk about what this idea of a Bar Raiser is in the hiring process and then what people can do if they wanted to add this to their hiring process?

Bill Carr (01:14:19):
So the Bar Raiser hiring process is a process, it was actually one of the first ones that was established and published, pretty early in the company's history back in 1999. And we created it for a simple reason, to quote one senior leader at Amazon, "We had new people hiring new people hiring new people." We were in our hyper-growth phase, okay? The company was only, what, three, four years old, and we were growing like a weed at that point.

(01:14:47):
So this started off actually in our tech org, and what our senior leaders in tech realized is, my gosh, we hire some new engineering leader, and then the next thing is that their job is to go hire the senior managers, and they'll go hire managers. And all these people have been here for a week, so they don't really even know our company yet, they don't know our culture yet, they don't know our standards yet. So what information are they using to make these hires, and what information they were using is obviously they were just using their own personal judgment, and their personal judgment combined with whatever criteria they used at prior companies that they worked for. So let's say if they came over from Microsoft, if Microsoft had some methodology or criteria, they probably would just apply that.

(01:15:38):
Well, is that methodology or criteria relevant to our company? Because every company has a different culture, and I'm here to tell you that if someone's been a super successful vice president at Microsoft, does not mean they could be as super successful at Amazon or at Google or Facebook. Sometimes they can, but these companies are very different, they all do work very differently. The way leadership happens and decisions are made are very different. So how do we fix this problem other than letting it run rampant and basically hire a bunch of people who are, we don't know if they fit our culture and we don't know if they fit our high standards we have for what we expect of engineering leaders or engineers?

(01:16:21):
So they created this Bar Raiser process, which by the way, they borrowed from Microsoft, which had a process called As Appropriate. And the concept was that on every interview loop there's one person, who is not the hiring manager, who doesn't report to the hiring manager, who's not the recruiting manager, they're in the business, they're a software development manager, or they're a marketing manager, and they are on the interview loop and they're a Bar Raiser, which means when we get to the debrief meeting, they will run that meeting, not the hiring manager, not the recruiter, they will run the meeting. And it also means that they technically have veto power over the hiring manager, which, by the way, a good Bar Raiser never uses, or I never saw a Bar Raiser use. I was a Bar Raiser, and in my 15 years at Amazon I never used it, never saw it used.

(01:17:14):
And then finally, which actually was not true in 1999 but later became true, was once we established our leadership principles, we created a set of objective criteria that would be used and an interview methodology that would be used in every interview, which was the objective criteria would be our leadership principles, and the methodology would be behavioral based interviewing.

(01:17:33):
So this Bar Raiser basically would be a subject matter expert on how this process worked, they'd conduct the debrief to make sure that we were actually adhering to the process, that people were sticking to the objective criteria rather than saying, "I don't think we should hire this person because, I don't know, they don't seem to want to work here enough." Maybe that's a valid reason, but it's actually not part of our objective criteria. And so the Bar Raiser was there to act as a balance also on the urgency bias that every hiring manager has, which is like, I got to fill these roles, but rather than filling them with the next warm body they find, make sure they fill them with people who actually meet our standards, fit our culture and meet our standards for functional excellence too.

Lenny (01:18:21):
Such a cool process. Two questions along these lines, one is who has the final decision in hiring, is it the hiring manager?

Bill Carr (01:18:27):
Yes.

Lenny (01:18:28):
And this is just off advice from the Bar Raiser?

Bill Carr (01:18:31):
Yeah, so this often gets confused. The decision maker is the hiring manager, the whole interview loop and the Bar Raiser are actually just there to help the hiring manager make the right decision. Now oftentimes the hiring manager could feel like this is actually a bureaucratic process and a group of people that I have to sell and they're just in my way between me and hiring this person, which is kind of a natural feeling to have.

(01:18:54):
But one of the feedback I would always give managers who are new to this is like, no, no, no, that's not the way to think about it, think about these people are helping you, because the amount of time you're going to put into the hiring process may seem like a lot, but if you hire the wrong person, boy, that amount of time you're going to have to deal with managing that person, that's going to be a lot more, the impact on the team, impact on you. So making a great decision here is important, they're here to help you.

(01:19:20):
So yes, the final decision is with the hiring manager, technically speaking the Bar Raiser could block them from a decision to hire someone, but they would, well done they would help the hiring manager see the reasons not to hire the person through a Socratic method and how they would guide the discussion.

Lenny (01:19:40):
And then when you're choosing a Bar Raiser, is there any suggestions you have of who to choose and how often you pull them into these things? Because it could also be a huge time suck.

Bill Carr (01:19:49):
It is a huge time suck, and it sometimes could be up to 10 hours of my week spent actually as a Bar Raiser. The selection process is you start with, as a company, I would recommend if you wanted to do this, you'd pick a department to pilot it with. Pick people who are A, care a lot about your hiring process, B, appear to be good interviewers, and C, seem to have high standards. It's also a great role for people who are earlier in their career by giving them this additional leadership opportunity. It's a great way to grow and develop leaders, by the way, because this added responsibility is a great way for them to start testing out leadership. And you have to train them properly and you have to have dedication to the process, but I generally would try to pilot it within one group at first.

Lenny (01:20:41):
One last question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Many people are listening to this, they're considering implementing some of these things, trying to figure out how to actually make these real. If someone were trying to move along the path of becoming more Amazonian, which of these elements and processes do you think often has the most impact? And/or is there something fundamental that needs to change to allow for some change like this to happen at a company, in your experience?

Bill Carr (01:21:10):
Yeah, good question. And the first thing I'd say is one thing to be careful of is a lot of times when I'm talking to a company about these processes they say, well, does this mean we need to turn into Amazon? And first thing I tell them is, well, first of all, I couldn't turn you into Amazon if I wanted to, because you have your own culture. And secondly, no, that's not the idea is for you to try to become Amazon, the purpose is to sort of look at these processes and best practices they have and consider adopting parts or all of them into your organization to improve these, every company of a certain scale has these same processes, so this is just a different way to do them. So you should have scalable, repeatable processes for each one of these, pick one, here's one choice of ways to do these things.

(01:21:58):
The other piece of advice I give is that a lot of these changes are relatively profound, they really require buy-in all the way up to the CEO, if you're really going to change the way you do product development, or if you're really going to change the way you do hiring, that probably requires buy-in of the CEO, and so I would seek to get that probably before I would move too fast. Some of these things, though, can be piloted in your own little group, like your one little product development group. You want to decide you want to start writing PR FAQs, you probably can decide to do that. But again, try to check with your leadership.

(01:22:32):
The other thing I would just tell you is that for any of these processes, these in our book, or any book, implementing a new process is not easy. And if you go into it lightly and dip your toes into it and try it out, it's probably not going to work for you, because it'll be hard at first, and it requires some level of commitment to actually work through that hard part and say, I'm really committed to doing this, and it will take a few months for you to get good at it. So you have to have commitment and discipline to get through it. Anyone can really do these things, it just requires commitment and discipline.

Lenny (01:23:10):
And in our chat we've basically just scratched the surface of a lot of these things, if people want to dig deeper there's obviously your book Working Backwards, which we'll link to in the show notes. I know you also work with companies to implement a lot of these practices. Could you just talk about what it is you can help folks with and then how to potentially engage if they're interested?

Bill Carr (01:23:27):
Sure, great. Yeah, Colin, and I, one of the reasons we wrote this book was to pass on what we learned to the next generation of business leaders at scale with a book, but also because we had a passion to work with companies directly one-to-one. And so we are advisors, consultants, call it what you will, but non-traditional, we don't have a team of people working for us. Each of us just work directly with the companies who engage us.

(01:23:55):
And generally speaking what we do is the right kind of company for us to work with, first of all, has to achieve a certain scale. Companies that are in the product market fit phase, they need to focus on getting product market fit, they probably don't really need to focus much on how they put in scalable, durable processes. Like sure, some of these could definitely be helpful to you even if you're in that phase, but really these are designed for, my company's become complex now, I've got multiple product lines, it's well over 100 million in annual run rate, growing fast, complex. So most of our clients are either large, well past series C private companies, or they're public companies. And in most cases, a C-level leader, or the CEO themselves, has read our book and recognizes that they have a lot of the same problems that we had at Amazon, and looks at these as useful solutions and wants us to help them implement them.

(01:24:56):
So we tend to usually first actually go in and do an assessment of how they do things today, because to help people move from one place to another we have to understand where they are, and then we come up with a prioritized list along with that, the CEO and C-level leaders, of what are the things that would be most useful, what are the symptoms and problems you're having and what are the root cause solutions that could be found in these processes? And then we sort of prioritize those and come up with a plan to work within the organization to help them implement those. And what's also different is that we're very hands- on working at all levels of the company, and as we do it we will be there in the meetings with the teams to help coach them and teach them along so that we make sure that it actually gets implemented properly and to spec, and they get to the outcome they want.

Lenny (01:25:45):
Sounds amazing. How would people engage with you if they wanted to explore this?

Bill Carr (01:25:51):
Simple way is you can just send an email, I'm bill@workingbackwards.com, and Colin is colin@workingbackwards.com. You can also just check out our website, www. workingbackwards.com. We have some information there, we have a contact us form, those would be the best ways.

Lenny (01:26:05):
Okay. Well with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, are you ready?

Bill Carr (01:26:11):
I'll try.

Lenny (01:26:12):
Interestingly, as I look through the list, many of them relate to using Amazon, which is pretty funny. The first is, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Bill Carr (01:26:23):
So I'd say in the management world, not surprisingly, Good to Great. I'd say Drucker on Management, or Drucker, The Effective Executive. And then the other one I'd say that's a little bit different is I'd recommend the Steve Jobs biography. I never worked at Apple, but looking at that arc, a lot of the way those things worked was not that different from what I experienced at Amazon, so it's a good window into what it's like to be inside some company, tech company, that goes through product innovation and big growth. On a personal basis, recent books would be Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is a favorite, and A Gentleman in Moscow.

Lenny (01:27:05):
Amazing. Can you get them all on Amazon?

Bill Carr (01:27:07):
Yes.

Lenny (01:27:07):
Another Amazon related question potentially is do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show? Might be on Prime, might not be.

Bill Carr (01:27:15):
Yeah, my favorite recent movie is the latest Dune movie, and I can't wait for the new one to come out.

Lenny (01:27:20):
When is that coming out? It seems like I've been waiting a long time.

Bill Carr (01:27:22):
I think it's supposed to come out next month. I used to know this, I used to have to know the answer to this question, but I don't anymore. But I anxiously await the next one, I thought that last one was awesome. I even liked the original Dune movie, so I'm probably unusual that way. And I just watched, along with my wife, we just enjoyed watching the TV series A Spy Among Friends, which was on MGM+.

Lenny (01:27:50):
MGM+, I have not even heard of that.

Bill Carr (01:27:52):
I had not actually heard of it either.

Lenny (01:27:54):
Another one to subscribe to.

Bill Carr (01:27:55):
But you can basically go onto Prime Video and you can find this show and you can subscribe to MGM+ through that.

Lenny (01:28:01):
Thank you Prime. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like, maybe that you bought on Amazon, maybe not.

Bill Carr (01:28:08):
This one I did not buy on Amazon, and this one is, most of you may not understand this one, but I'm an avid cyclist and I got myself a new set of wheels for my road bike this year, actually my road bike and my gravel bike. It's the Zipp 303 Firecrest, the latest model, and boy, these are just fantastic wheels. They're light, they're sturdy, they absorb all the bumps well, I can use them on a road bike, I can use them on a gravel bike, awesome wheels.

Lenny (01:28:35):
Wow, that might be the most obscure random product that we've had yet. Recently we had a humidifier, so I like this collection of products we're building here. Create a wishlist on Amazon maybe.

Bill Carr (01:28:47):
Nice.

Lenny (01:28:47):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you really like to ask?

Bill Carr (01:28:52):
Yeah, it's actually quite basic, it's tell me about your most significant professional accomplishment. And I have to always clarify this, by this I mean not some award you won or some promotion you got, I mean something you built, or some product, some process, some organization you built, something like that. And I could basically then, once they get into that example, ask a lot of probing and follow-up questions and I could fill an entire hour interview just sticking with this one example to really understand how they... Using the STAR method, which is to try to understand everything from the situation to the result, and everything they did in between, who they influenced, how they'd influenced, what decisions they had to make, what roadblocks they encountered. If I just pull on that one string I can learn a whole lot about a candidate.

Lenny (01:29:46):
Next question, what's a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends, that you find useful?

Bill Carr (01:29:55):
Well, one that I end up coming to a lot professionally, and somewhat personally, is this one called slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This is a, I believe the origins of this one are actually from the Marine Corps for the Scout Snipers, so not trying to promote that particular craft, but the point of it is that actually, and we did this a lot at Amazon, it really oftentimes, to really to go fast, you actually need to go slow first and to be very clear on what you're doing and where you want to go. Most people confuse speed with velocity, and the difference between the two is that velocity has both speed and a vector to it, meaning there's some specific destination. And so I see a lot of people who are going very, very fast, but the destination isn't very clear, they haven't really thought that out well. So slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

Lenny (01:30:57):
There's a similar quote that I've always thought of, of you've got to go slow to go fast. And I always thought it was was Stephen Covey, but I just Googled as you were chatting and it's someone named Peter Senge in the book Fifth Discipline.

Bill Carr (01:31:11):
It took me a while, I always wanted to go fast first and not go slow first, so I'd say a lot of my personal development and growth, it's a big thing that I learned from Jeff at Amazon.

Lenny (01:31:25):
Final question, I don't know if you'll have an answer to this, but is there a pro-tip that you could suggest for using Amazon? Something that people may not know about how to get the most out of using amazon.com?

Bill Carr (01:31:36):
Sorry, I have no secret insights. There's not something like if you go on Monday mornings at this time the prices are lower, or something, or in stock is better. No, I know of no such thing.

Lenny (01:31:49):
Which I think is great, because it's built exactly as it should be for customers.

Bill Carr (01:31:54):
I guess so. But it used to be, maybe in the days of the slower internet, that I would tell you to go at non-peak hours, but this isn't really an issue anymore.

Lenny (01:32:06):
That'd be wild if that was still an issue. Bill, this was everything I hoped it would be, thank you so much for being here. You already shared where folks can find you online, so I'll skip that question. So final question is, how can listeners be useful to you?

Bill Carr (01:32:19):
We're always looking for feedback. You can post a review on Amazon for our book, that's probably the best way. You can fill out the contact us form or send us an email telling us what you found most useful in the book, or what you actually found is missing, what would you like to learn more about? If we were to write another book, or write more, what would you like us to tell you about?

Lenny (01:32:46):
Amazing, and that's bill@workingbackwards.com if they have that feedback. Go buy the book Working Backwards on Amazon and other places, and workingbackwards.com to learn more. Bill, thank you again so much for being here.

Bill Carr (01:32:59):
Thanks so much, Lenny, really enjoyed it.

## Transcript

Bob Baxley (00:00:00):
Almost everyone living in a modern economy now is going to have hundreds of interactions with a phone or with a computer. And unfortunately, a lot of those interactions are not going to be great. We have an obligation as product people to put that emotional energy back into people's lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
You actually have a really unique perspective on just what is design.

Bob Baxley (00:00:17):
Design is trying to imagine the future you want to live in and then take the steps to make it real. Saying a company is design-led does not mean it's designer-led. I've never seen somebody graft it on after the fact. It's there at the beginning in the root DNA or doesn't exist.

(00:00:31):
It wasn't a successful stint at Pinterest. I just bounced off the culture. I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Why did you decide to join Apple?

Bob Baxley (00:00:42):
I just seek out opportunities to witness history. The whole company is constantly asking how can the thing that I'm working on be a little bit better?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Why do you Think that people that have left Apple, a lot of amazing things haven't emerged? Today, my guest is Bob Baxley. Bob is a designer, executive and advisor who's built in led design teams at Apple, Pinterest, Yahoo, and most recently ThoughtSpot. Over the course of his career that spanned over three decades, Bob has played a pivotal role in the design of the Apple online store, the Apple App Store, Pinterest, and early in his career Yahoo Answers, products that have been used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.

(00:01:21):
Bob also mentors individuals and advises organizations that are working to improve the practice, craft and culture of digital product design. There is something in this conversation for everyone from why you should consider having designed report engineering, why it's your moral obligation to build great products, why you should wait as long as possible to draw a picture or create a prototype of your idea to what the Moon Landing can teach us about building better teams and products. I could listen to Bob all day. I learned a ton from this conversation, including a bunch of really unique insights that I've never heard before.

(00:01:54):
A big thank you to Annie Warner, Andrew Hogan, Irene A, and Joff Redfern for suggesting questions for this conversation.

(00:02:23):
This entire episode is brought to you by Stripe. There's a reason that I've had more guests on this podcast from Stripe than any other company. It's because they hire the best people and they build incredible products. You probably know them for their payments platform, which powers my newsletter, and also companies like Nvidia and Salesforce and Zoom and DoorDash. What you may not know is that they have several other products that can help accelerate your revenue, such as Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of, OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies. Stripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers however you want from simple recurring billing to usage-based billing to sales negotiated contracts.

(00:03:08):
There's also Stripe's Optimized Checkout Suite which is a plug and play super optimized payments flow that natively supports over 100 global dynamic payment methods. There's also a product called LINQ, which is an accelerated checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that have a product in the market today use Stripe to monetize it. Half of Fortune 100 companies use Stripe. $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of global GDP. Use Stripe to handle all of your payment related needs, billing, manage revenue operations, and launch or invent new business models. Learn more at stripe.com. Bob, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Bob Baxley (00:04:00):
Lenny, thank you so much. Thanks for having me, but also just thank you for what you do. We are still in early days to try to figure out how to make software together. I think of it like where the film industry was in the 1920s. We've had our talkie moment. We're on the cusp of having our shift to color movement, but we're still trying to figure out how to make movies and a podcast like yours specifically yours I think is one of the greatest resources we have for learning from one another. I appreciate all you're doing for the community and for helping us as a community make better software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:31):
Wow. Well, I really appreciate that. That means a lot coming from you. There's so much I want to talk about in our conversation. There's a story that I hear that you often tell, which is when somebody asked Steve Jobs once, what is your favorite product that you've built that you work on? And his answer, what's that story?

Bob Baxley (00:04:49):
So I actually can't remember where I heard this, but I believe the story's true. Steve at one point was recounting the products that he had created that he was most proud of, and if I recall the whole list, it was the Apple II, the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, I think Apple retail was in the list and then he said Apple itself. When I heard that and when I've reflected on it, that is the longest lasting thing. I remember there was also a story that Steve was talking to, I think it was either Ed Catmull or John Lasseter at Pixar, and he said, "Everything we make is going to be a doorstop in three years, but the stuff you guys make, they're still going to be watching in 100 years." So I think Steve had some concept of the longevity of these things.

(00:05:33):
They knew the products themselves were very ephemeral, but there's something about the culture of Apple that's lasted a very long time and I personally believe will last for some time yet to come. It's a way of making decisions, it's a way of behaving, it's a way of seeing the value of technology in the world and it infuses everything in that company. I mean everything from the checkout system when you go to the receptionist to what it's like in the cafeteria. At least when I was there, they had patented the pizza box because they had reinvented the pizza box that you would get at Cafe Max because the whole company is constantly asking how can the thing that I'm working on be a little bit better? I think that was something Steve brought to them and had them constantly asking that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:16):
One more Apple question then I'll move on to other stuff. Why do you think that people that have left Apple, a lot of amazing things haven't emerged from people that have left? Humane was a recent example. We're recording this the day after Jony Ive Open AI emerged so we'll see what happens there but just feels like there hasn't been a ton of alumni that have built incredible things.

Bob Baxley (00:06:38):
Obviously Tony Fadell would be one with Nest and he'd be an outlier. I think the people that... I went to Pinterest and did not have a successful time in my year and a half at Pinterest. I think my own particular mistake, and I've seen this with some other Apple executives as well as we went directly from Apple, I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday. I didn't give myself time to recalibrate to the Pinterest culture. I think at some level, a lot of the challenge is that Apple, and it's not just Apple, I think every major tech company, they have really powerful cultures.

(00:07:11):
You get indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep. It fuses all of your behavior and how you conduct yourself in the company, away from the company. I think it's pretty hard to immigrate successfully from one of those environments to another. Apple is one of the strongest cultures and there's not many other cultures that natively operate like that. Airbnb is one exception. And so you have guys like Hiroki Asai who leads all of marketing and all of product and Hiroki is crushing at Airbnb. He was incredibly successful at Apple.

(00:07:43):
It also should be noted that he had, it was a multi-year gap between the time he left Apple and the time he started Airbnb. He gave himself a little bit of time to get through the... At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve used to talk about the Apple car wash. Then when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well. And so I think Hiroki gave himself time to do that and I think that's probably a lot of why he's been so successful at Airbnb. The thing I took away from Apple, and I think this is true for anybody changing from one major culture to another is most likely the new place hires you because of the values of the organization you left, but not the behaviors.

(00:08:23):
And so I think it's important to recalibrate and say, well, I want to hold onto these values. So at Apple, attention to detail, product excellence, doing everything you can for the customer and the user so try to hold onto those values but then think, okay, how are those values best expressed in this culture? I was more successful at expressing those values in the culture of ThoughtSpot, which was my last job than I was in the culture of Pinterest. If I had to do it again, I could probably do better at Pinterest. I think that's useful for anybody leaving one very specific culture and going someplace else, try to hold onto the values but not the behaviors.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:59):
This is so interesting and I appreciate you sharing that, the way you described it that it wasn't a successful stint at Pinterest. A lot of people don't share that sort of story and don't put it that way. They see on their LinkedIn, oh, a head of design at Pinterest. Oh, amazing so cool. And then if you're like, oh, okay, but it didn't work out that well, I think that's really interesting. Is there anything more you can share there about what you learned for other people to maybe avoid that sort of situation? Anything you took away from that experience?

Bob Baxley (00:09:25):
One of my friends that was at Pinterest, I'm still friends with, he said, "I just thought of it as you bounced off the culture." I think that's kind of the way to think of it. I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard. Everybody cares about each other. It's never insulting, but it's intense. That's not really where Pinterest was at the time. Again, all this is a decade ago, so I don't know what any of these companies are like today, but at least when I was there, Pinterest had posters in every conference room that said, big poster that said, say the hard thing. Well, that's where Pinterest was at the time, and I can assure you nobody at Apple was having to remind you to say the hard thing.

(00:10:07):
And so I probably could have picked up on that better than I did. I'll say these careers are really hard and the higher up you go, people think of it like you're climbing a pyramid. I think of it more like you're going out on a branch on a tree and the branch gets a lot more flimsy and can break and you can fall and you get buffeted about by the wind. It's often at a time in your life when there's a lot going on with your family, there could be things going on with your parents' health. I lost my mother when I was at Pinterest. My kids were starting high school, so we're struggling with the teenage years. I had a long commute. It's a lot going on and these jobs are super demanding.

(00:10:46):
Everything around you is changing really rapidly and you're under tremendous pressure because the financial and success stakes are super high. I think the people falling off of these jobs is the common use case. That is the common story. We have a bias towards survivors and we all talk about how it looks like they made it to the top, but everybody that makes it to the top, there's hundreds of people that don't. One of the things I took away when I was at Pinterest was I came to think that the job of a startup was to grow the founder so they could continue to lead the startup. I think what's true for founders, also true for a lot of the other folks in the executive staff, it's very hard to grow emotionally and developmentally at the rate that the company grows.

(00:11:32):
A lot of times I think people get outgrown by the role, and I saw that across Apple. I've experienced that myself at different times in my career. I see that happening with my friends and it feels like a failure. I mean, that is the human experience, that's what happens. It's very hard to grow as fast as some of these companies are growing and we could debate the merits of Mark Zuckerberg for example. But when you think about the trajectory from being a kid in a dorm room to within five years, Facebook's a big thing. I mean, think of your own life. Can you process that level of evolution and change? I don't know, I think that's really super hard to do that and stay balanced.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:15):
And also keep doing that for so long. There'll be founders, I think it was Brian's maybe first job or second job, and he's doing that now for 15 years in a row.

Bob Baxley (00:12:24):
Oh, founders, it's their life. It's very unusual to see founders move out. I had this other theory that a startup is still a startup until the founder moves aside. By my definition of even Meta is still a startup in a way that Amazon's not, and Airbnb is still a startup in a way that Pinterest is not because Ben's moved on. You don't find out if the culture can sustain itself until the founders are gone and then you really see what's going to happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
Just to close the loop here, one takeaway here that I think is really interesting is that you can fail in a job and things will be okay. Clearly you're doing A okay and having a place that doesn't work out, doesn't destroy your career, which I think a lot of people feel like if they're not doing well in their current job, it's over. Things are all going to go downhill

Bob Baxley (00:13:08):
Your career's not your life. There's a lot more to it than that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:11):
And then just to give someone something tactical here, so you've realized the culture of Pinterest, you bounced off of it. I love that metaphor. If you were to, when you're looking at new companies, what's one thing you look at or a question you ask or something you now look at to make sure you avoid that in the future, that culture clash?

Bob Baxley (00:13:30):
I'm fortunate at this stage of my career that I usually get to interview with the CEO or the founders or something like that. What I'm usually looking for is do they have a story as to why they believe in design? Really in their heart and soul, do they care about design? Because if I go into a company that doesn't really value the thing that I do, I'm just not going to have a great time and I'm going to be constantly buffeting up against all sorts of people. I want to make sure I've got air cover from the highest people in the company setting the culture.

(00:13:57):
In the case of, again, my most recent job was with a company called ThoughtSpot. And ThoughtSpot was founded by a gentleman named Ajeet Singh, and Ajeet grew up in rural India, but he tells this really great story about he studied chemical engineering, he moves to the United States. Early in his career, he's working for Honeywell and they did a couple of engagements with IDEO. As a very young person, he got to see what IDEO did and he realized the power of design and he's taken that to all of his companies. He started Nutanix before he came to ThoughtSpot, before he started ThoughtSpot. And so when I heard that, I'm like, oh, this is a guy that gets design right from the very beginning.

(00:14:32):
I've also come to believe that I actually have never seen a company that grafted design on after the founding. I could name lots of companies that I think are kind of design led, not always designer led, but design led or design centric. But I've never seen somebody grafted on after the fact. It's there at the beginning in the root DNA or doesn't exist. And so the thing that I'm looking for when I interview is, is it there at the beginning? Can I get a credible story that tracks it back to that?

(00:14:59):
And if that's the case, then I think I can find a way to navigate in that culture. We have a shared value system in a way that as an American, I could immigrate to Australia and the culture would be slightly different, but we'd have a shared value system that I could relate to. If I moved to, I don't know, Burma or China or something, it would be wildly more challenging because the base view of the world, the base understanding of the world's just different and it'd be much harder for me to adapt to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):
I think a way to extrapolate that insight is just whatever function you're in, get a sense of how important that function is to that business. Do the founders value engineering? Do they value product? Do they value design? Depending on who you are.

Bob Baxley (00:15:42):
Why would you want to work in a place that doesn't value the thing that you do? God, that would suck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:47):
You actually have a really unique perspective on just what is design that I haven't heard before. Let me ask you that question is what is design?

Bob Baxley (00:15:55):
Well, I'm going to go back to the Edward Tufte quote that I use all the time, which is design is clear thinking made visible. And so I think most people when they talk about design, they think of it as the visual expression of an idea. They think of it as a team or a function or a group. I think of it as a holistic mindset. When design thinking became big, I was always really confused because I didn't know how else you could think. That was just how I naturally thought, which is design is trying to imagine the future you want to live in and then take the steps to make it real.

(00:16:27):
It's living with a certain type of intentionality in almost a Buddhist type way, which is different from science, which is observational trying to understand. It's a little bit different from engineering, which is we kind of know where we want go at the end, but we're trying to go one step at a time versus design's trying to see some further out future state and account for a larger or a different set of constraints and issues than engineering or some of the other problem solving methodologies. Again, I look at it as a company, does the company think in a design mindset and Apple does, Airbnb does. I don't get the sense that Google does and I don't get the sense that Amazon does. That's not a critique on them. I don't think that those organizations are competing on design in the same way. But again, I want to go work at a place that as an organization thinks in a design type method.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:19):
Along those lines, a lot of people imagine every founder, every product builder is just, yes, I'd love amazing design. I'd love our products to be incredibly beautiful, intuitive, so easy for everyone to use and understand, but they don't actually invest in these areas and they don't put a lot of resources into the designing process. What's the best pitch you can make and that you do make to companies to help them see the strategic value of design and the bottom of the value of design.

Bob Baxley (00:17:50):
Let me back up and just dissect a little bit the way you described design, you described it in really tactical terms. You said beautiful, intuitive products that make sense. I think it was something like that. What you were describing was you were describing the part of the iceberg that sits above the water line, which is the result. That's one of the outcomes of design, but that's not the real heavy lifting of design. Design is more like liberal arts or philosophy or something. It's like what do we try to achieve at a much lower level? And so what I talk to founders and people about the value of design, what I'm pushing them on is when we can get organizational alignment around what we want to do philosophically, why do we exist? What's the vision for the company? How do all these things ladder up through vision, through mission, through specific tenets, design strategies.

(00:18:36):
And then into actual execution. How do we ladder that whole thing up so it makes sense as a whole? That's the magic of design. The difference is when you design things, you end up with a bunch of bricks that are piled into a beautiful impenetrable wall. If you don't do that, you end up with a bunch of bricks scattered across the backyard and they don't really add up to anything. I think that's one of the things, if you look, again to go back to Apple, but we could also talk about Lego Lyca, Porsche, Airbnb, Patagonia, there's other companies that make sense as a design centered organization. If you think about everything they do, it all ladders together into one cohesive sensical thing. It's integrated. Makes sense as a unit.

(00:19:20):
I think that's a huge difference and an incredible strategic advantage because the company can operate with much greater efficiency. They can onboard new people and get them in line. Even Apple, for example, the team that designed the online store, we had six designers for a store that ran in 30 some odd countries, 12 and a half thousand instances of the store doing billions of dollars of revenue. We had six designers. Any other company would've had 60 or more. Apple's able to operate with much smaller staff because they have real clarity of vision of what they're doing. And the benefit of operating with a smaller staff is not just that it saves money on payroll, it's that you have... The way the minds come together to create something that feels like a single whole is a much higher chance when you have fewer people involved.

(00:20:10):
I joke about The Beatles. You get The Beatles with four people, you don't get The Beatles with eight people and you certainly don't get it with 24 people. The teams get too big and you can't get that what Brian Eno calls scenius. Brian Eno has this great word that he uses, scenius is the genius that comes when you have a group together. Scenius is the collective idea of genius and I think that's something that's really magical that I've experienced in my career, but usually in smaller groups. It's hard to do with a giant group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:40):
I love this metaphor of The Beatles as the way most people describe this is designed by committee never works. I love that the way you describe it is the Beatles is like the ideal size a small group versus a committee.

Bob Baxley (00:20:54):
I just always have to point out to people that there are 20 people that worked on the original Mac. I mean it's 20 of them, that's it, 20. Susan Kare was one of them, Andy Hertzfeld, you go through the list, 20 of them are on the patent. There's 24 that are on the iPhone patent. Now there's other people involved, but generally there's 24 people on the iPhone patent. And that was the team. That was Project Purple that was doing that stuff. These are not massive massive groups doing these things. If you had put a massive group, I don't know man, maybe it'd end up with the Zune or something completely different. Who knows?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):
They probably did have a massive group on the Zune.

Bob Baxley (00:21:27):
Yeah, so there's something, four is too few for what we're trying to achieve at scale. But even if you look at Pixar, any good movie on the scripting and story side, it's usually a fairly small team. Even when you move into character development, stuff like that, it's fairly small and then it really scales when you move into production. It's just hard to figure out something new to do together when there's too many people involved.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
I think that word new is really key here. I think when people hear this advice, they're thinking at their existing company, should we just keep our company small? Should we not scale this thing that we have? I think what you're describing, which I completely agree with is new stuff for sure you want to keep the team small and tight, but as things grow and scale, what's your take on just, okay, actually it's okay to have a lot of people on this.

Bob Baxley (00:22:13):
Well, you have to bring a lot of people in once you figure out what you're doing. And so to your point, once you realize you're building Disneyland and you've got the whole thing set and people know what it's about, then they can come in and understand, oh, I'm playing my piece over here. I'm supposed to design the line experience for the new ride sitting in Tomorrowland, but I know where that fits into this larger thing. I think you can scale once you have clarity of vision, but it's very difficult to get vision with a lot of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:42):
Great. I think that's really powerful advice. It's just when you're starting something new. I actually had a CPA of N26 who was basically leading Google Hangouts, the initial launch of Google Hangouts, and he told the story of they put so many resources on it. We got to win. We got to do this. Larry Page or Sergey was sitting next to him just like we got to make this work and putting everything they could into it and it didn't work out. And I think that's-

Bob Baxley (00:23:07):
No, no, the more people you put in it, the slower everything becomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:09):
I want to go back to something you said about what design is. I think this is really interesting. And so the way you described design to a lot of people, it sounds like that's like product management also and product leadership, setting, strategy, vision, figuring out how everything fits together. I think your experience here, I think Apple is a very different kind of company where design actually leads a lot of this. At a lot of other companies, it doesn't work that way. Any thoughts? And just how you advise companies, think about the split between design and product management that aren't Apple.

Bob Baxley (00:23:38):
One of the best lines I ever heard was from my friend Joseph O'Sullivan at dinner one night. He said saying a company is design led does not mean it's designer led. And so what I try to hammer home with people is that when I talk about design as a mindset, I'm talking about it as a mindset. Anybody could have that mindset functioning in any role, any designer could have a product mindset. In fact, I think that's a lot of what the design community is trying to get at now when they say designers should be speaking the language of business. I think what they're saying is designers need to inhabit the product mindset as well. Maybe to some degree even the sales mindset.

(00:24:11):
Look, both functions matter. I look at my counterparts in product and I assume that they're much better connected to the customer, that they understand much better the business realities, and I expect them to drive the roadmap. I may have some points of view on the roadmap. I may offer some critique. I may have my own suggestions and agenda in there. But once they say this is the roadmap, I have to believe that they're right and I don't try to bleed into their space. I very much believe that once you get into a company, your job is to figure out your role and respect the boundaries between the different groups.

(00:24:43):
I'm like, you guys tell us what you need us to do, what the features need to be, when they need to be delivered, what the issues are, and then give us the time and space to come up with a solution to those problems. And then we can work together to decide whether or not our solutions actually solve the problem as you understand it, but I'll stay out of your roadmap and you stay out of my design stop and let's try to get to the promised land together. I assume that the product managers, particularly in enterprise SaaS companies, like my team, ThoughtSpot did data analytics. My team didn't know anything about data analytics. We didn't have any of that insight. We didn't have the bandwidth, the mental horsepower to go out and do that stuff. We had our hands full just trying to figure out the UI.

(00:25:22):
It's one of the points I try to make too, when people are starting to theorize that gen AI can remove teammates and oh, the designers don't need engineers and the PMs don't need the designers and everybody thinks they can throw engineering overboard. And I'm like, stop it. We all need each other and we need each other because we need those different mindsets. One of those mindsets inhabits somebody's head completely. I just don't think you can simultaneously hold multiple mindsets in your head. It's not that one of my PM counterparts couldn't bring a lot to the design table, it's just I need you to play that position. Like in baseball, the second-

Bob Baxley (00:26:00):
Like in baseball, the second baseman doesn't cover first. That's not how it works. Everybody's got to spread the field and play their position so we can take care of the whole thing and respect that together we're going to come up with something better than any one of us would've come up with alone and embrace the creative tension, welcome it. We still have to all go out to lunch and love each other and have fun together and keep in mind that we're having fun together, but I like the rub. That's where all the magic happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:28):
That was a very illuminating clarification. Something else that I heard you believe that I haven't heard before is that design share report to engineering.

Bob Baxley (00:26:38):
So I'll say that every company culture is different and different organizations work in different ways. In my experience, I think that design is most successful at impacting what ships at the end if design is considered phase zero of the engineering process, rather than a by product or a part of the product process. What I've seen happen over and over in my experience, a ThoughtSpot, Pinterest, other places when you're working directly with product, it's easy to leave engineering out of the loop and product and design can go cook up stuff that doesn't quite make sense technically or is really hard to implement or is just a bridge too far. And I think that engineering doesn't feel like they're a part of it, so you bring them at the end and they haven't really been brought along so they don't quite understand how to extrapolate from the specs you make into what should really ship.

(00:27:25):
Maybe they don't bring the same level of enthusiasm to it, because they haven't been brought along. So I think there's something about having the design and engineering team very tightly connected and kind of living together. And it's not that you have to do that structurally from an organization point of view, but it's hard-pressed if you don't. I also think you can just account for timelines and costs and things better when design's part of engineering. And many of my design friends will push back on this and they'll say design should be its own thing and it should be an independent group and we should have three co-equal branches of government, and that's a solid argument as well, and there's some places where that works beautifully. My experiences at design rarely has a budget or an army, and so it's very hard for them to really hold their own in that sort of a setting.

(00:28:09):
Also, although you'll see people argue with me on LinkedIn about how design needs to be measured and we need to have metrics and be held accountable for a number, I don't really believe that in my heart. I've just never seen a number that you could apply to design that we could reliably affect. So I think it's very hard to hold design as an organization accountable for a particular outcome the way that most of the other C-level roles are held accountable. Sales has a number, engineering has very specific expectations, product has very specific expectations. And although I know this will frustrate some of my friends, I just haven't been able to figure out how that works for design. And again, it can vary from culture to culture. Certainly there's very successful chief design officers and we could go through the list. I just think in many companies it's a stretch, it's just hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):
What I see work, and I'm curious to get your take is just product, engineering, design have exactly the same goal and the more everyone... And their performance as an employee is tied to the same thing essentially because then everyone is pushing in the same direction versus like, oh, I have my engineering goal, I have my design goal, I have my PM goal, and just creates all kinds of weird incentives.

Bob Baxley (00:29:17):
Yeah, look, I would kind of defer to you on that, honestly. You've talked to a lot more people across a lot more companies, so you have a much broader set of information you're working with. If you add my whole career together, I've worked at maybe half a dozen places, so a fairly limited sample set. And every design team that I've ever been a part of, I've been a part of. So I also kind of have a biased view as to what didn't work for me in those particular organizations. I'll go back to what I said, every company's different, every culture is slightly different. It's not one size fits all.

(00:29:45):
I point out the idea of design reporting to engineering just because I don't think people consider the possibility often enough. So there's three options, design is its own thing, design is part of product, design is part of engineering. And I think there's a moment when you can back up and make an intelligent choice about the pros and cons for each of those options inside your org. And so I would encourage people to just take a design mentality and put on that designer mindset just for a moment and say, well, what's the thing that we're trying to produce? What's the incentives that we're trying to create? What's the future state that we're trying to get to? And which of these three options, permutations is going to help us get there the best?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
I love how radical this idea is. I've not heard it. I think designers will be like, " You stop it. Just stop it." So have you operated this way? Have you had design report to engineering in companies you've worked at?

Bob Baxley (00:30:38):
Sorry, but that's how it worked at Apple the whole time under Steve. Design always reported to engineering. Now I think it's structured a little bit differently, but design has always been part of engineering at Apple, so I saw it work quite effectively there obviously.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:53):
It's so interesting. Okay, so say just to give someone something very tactical to do on their team, say they don't want to go to this extreme and move the design org under engineering, what's something you've seen work that helps achieve similar outcomes with having engineers integrated early in the design process?

Bob Baxley (00:31:09):
Yeah, look, I think you have to find some way that you are able to identify a few people in engineering that I refer to as creative technologists. So these are people that can come into what's ultimately kind of a fairly airy-fairy philosophical discussion about what we could do and what's right from a conceptual model perspective. Ultimately, it's sort of a philosophy issue. And there's not that many PMs or engineers that can sit in that space and be comfortable with the ambiguity of it all. A PM's likely going to come in and they're going to say, okay, well that was a great one hour. What's the next step? And as a designer I'm always like, well, the next step is we're going to have another meeting and we're going to talk again. And the engineers oftentimes when they're starting to hear different ideas, they're already cutting into the code and they're trying to figure out what's hard and what's easy.

(00:31:54):
And so I think the trick is at the beginning, can you find a small group of people from the different functions that can sit with the ambiguity of the space and talk through a broad range of ideas to identify the direction we want to go into? And then once everybody kind of falls in love with the direction, then you can go into the more tactical mindset of, okay, well, when we can ship it and who can we show it to and how are we going to code it and when's it going to go live and all those sorts of things. But the trick is to try to find a group that can sit, again, in the ambiguous maybe space. I do think it's critical to have everybody together at the beginning so they all feel like they're part of it. And the worst thing is when you bring something fully baked... Well, the worst thing when you bring something fully baked to anybody for their approval.

(00:32:36):
We could talk about this when you take a final design to an exec and an exec sees it for the first time in a high resolution state, I'll get to that in a second. But when you go to an engineering team says, "Hey, we've been working in the lab for six months and we have this thing that we love it and we just can't wait for you guys to build it, and here it is," I don't know, [inaudible 00:32:54] mention here. They're going to be excited about. They're not order takers. How do you make them part of the process? And every product of consequence that I worked on, there was some moment when we were showing it to some critical person and you could see that they fell in love with it. Sometimes they're literally pointing at the comps on the board, sometime you're in a meeting and they're just like, "God, I just love this."

(00:33:14):
And for me, that was always the critical moment because I knew that design can't bring you this stuff into the world on its own. We can't raise this baby, we need the village, and we need the village to fall in love with the baby. And so until that happens, you're not really quite sure if this thing's going to take off or not. And so it was always extremely important to me that you had a few key engineers and some product people fall in love with it so they could defend it and embrace it and enhance it and add to it. And you got to bring them along at the very beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
What I'm hearing there is there's a big part of just buy-in and then there's also just obviously more good ideas early are great.

Bob Baxley (00:33:52):
Yeah, sorry. Buy-in doesn't feel quite right to me, because buy-in feels like, oh, I've come to agree with you. And that's different from it's a part of me. When I'm talking to teams, the thing I try to tell them is, I walk into the office every day with the idea that everyone that I work with is fundamentally a maker. Everybody in product design, engineering, we've all chosen these careers. Everybody's super smart, everybody's super ambitious. Everybody could have done a thousand other things, but they're choosing to spend their precious lifetime and creative energy creating software.

(00:34:28):
And so I believe in my heart that they're all fundamentally makers. And the thing that I know about makers is that they all want to make something they're proud of so they can take it home at the end of the day and show it to their parents and say, "Look at what I made at school with my friends today." That's the fundamental thing, and they're all doing it from their own different points of view and their own different incentives and mindsets, but they all at the end of the day want to make something they're proud of. And so it's not a matter of getting their buy-in, it's a matter of them being a part of it. I don't know, it's a part of their soul in a really deep, meaningful way. And I'm not sure you can graph that onto somebody after the fact. They kind of need to be there at the moment of inception, if you will.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):
Wow, that's a really beautiful answer. I imagine for a lot of people hearing this, making every feature and product they build a part of their soul feels like a very high bar if they're building some kind of B2B SaaS software. So I guess just thoughts in just how much you should spend, how much time, how many resources, how deep you go on design for all these things you're building. Say you're building some kind of, I don't know, expense management system or HRS thing, just like, what do you recommend people do with, in terms of just how far to go in design as a lever, as a differentiator maybe?

Bob Baxley (00:35:49):
Well, inherent in your question is this assumption that design takes more time. And so I'm going to kind of reject that premise, because I don't think design takes more time. I think design exists. There is going to be a design. It's whether it's going to be a good one or not. And I think there's things that you can do so that you're able to operate it at a quicker pace as design. Again, if you get the... We haven't talked about tenets yet, but we'll get to that in a moment. If you kind of create a shared philosophical understanding of the product and what you're trying to do, you can go really fast because you're not asking the question of what should you do, you're asking the question of, what would this company with what we stand for do for this thing? And that's a much easier question that's much smaller.

(00:36:29):
So if you look at the companies that have the largest design teams, they're often the companies that have the most ambiguous cultures and the most unclear design vision. When you go to companies that really know what they're doing and they're clear that this is who we are, this is what we stand for, the design teams are super small because they're not sitting there trying to do all these permutations with color and typography and ideas. They're operating in a really narrow vein, because they know who they are. It's very much like individuals. When you're a teenager or a young adult, you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to wear because you haven't really sorted it out yet. But by the time you get to be a little bit older, you've kind of got your personal style, and so dressing in the morning gets to be a lot easier.

(00:37:09):
Like at Pinterest. I was at Pinterest at a point when Pinterest wasn't quite sure who it was. And so when we were going to do an onboarding flow, we had to look at a really broad sweep of things, because we were trying to sort it out. But you had other places that knew what they were about, Apple's the key example there, we weren't trying to figure out what it was about. We were trying to figure out what was the apple way to do this particular thing, and so that moves a lot faster.

(00:37:31):
And I agree, look, having your soul at every little checkbox sounds like a high bar and in some ways it is. I think you need to be able to back up and look at the product, maybe not at every state, but generally every six months or a year, you need to back up and ask yourself, am I proud of this? Is this something I am happy to be a part of? Do I believe in this? Is it a representative of my best work given the circumstances I was in, which has limitations around time and resources and everything else, is this the best I could do or am I just sort of trying to get through the day I have other goals?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:06):
So let's actually follow the thread of design tenets and principles. This is something I've heard about you, that you're a big fan of design tenets versus design principles. What is the difference? Why is this so important?

Bob Baxley (00:38:20):
Yeah, so look, there's whole websites dedicated to design principles, and if you go and you read it, you'll see a lot of principles like simple, clear, beautiful, fast, secure. You'll hear these words and all these words are great. I mean, obviously I have nothing against any of these words, but they're not useful as decision-making tools because nobody would ever argue the opposite. Nobody ever sat in a meeting and said, "Oh, forget clear. Let's try to make it as confusing as possible." So the idea of clear, it's nice to have out there as, I don't know, sort of a platitude to move towards, but I just don't think it helps you make decisions. And so tenets are really decision-making tools and it's sort of like... A classic one is paper versus plastic. It's just too complicated to reconsider that every time you're at the grocery store. So you sort of make a rule for yourself and you're just a paper person or a plastic person, you move on from there.

(00:39:07):
And so it's sort of that at scale. And the story comes from when they were starting to work on Keynotes, apparently the guy who was responsible for originating Keynote went to Steve and said, "How should we think about Keynote?" And Steve said, "I want you to keep three things in mind. One is it should be difficult to make ugly presentations. Two, you should focus on cinematic quality transitions. And three, you should optimize for innovation over PowerPoint compatibility." And if you take that last one in particular, if he hadn't kind of said, we're going to go this way instead of that way, that team would've spent the next 10 years gouging each other's eyes out over whether they should try to go for PowerPoint compatibility or innovation. And so when I was at ThoughtSpot, I realized pretty early on that I wasn't going to be able to have any sort of command and control over everything that was going to happen in the product.

(00:39:56):
There was too many people involved, too many engineering teams, most of them were in India. I needed to move from a mindset of control to one of choreography. I needed to try to set the culture and set certain design tenets that everyone could internalize and follow and hopefully then make the right decisions in that groove, if you will. And so we had three, I think you can't have more than three or four because you need everybody to memorize them. They can't be consulting a handbook. And so, one of them was documentation is a failure state. In enterprise companies, a lot of times people think, "Oh, we'll just put it in the manual. It'll be part of the training." And I would constantly be coming back and go, "Stop it. Nobody wants to learn our software. Nobody cares. We are just one more browser tab in a world of browser tabs. We are not this user's complete world. They do not want to learn this stuff."

(00:40:46):
Documentation's a failure state. Maybe we can't always avoid it, but we should do everything we can to simplify things so you can figure it out in the context of the product. That's number one. Number two is every interaction should start simple and the users should have to opt into complexity. So our main competitor at the time was Tableau. Tableau started with complexity. That was their whole value prop is like, "We're a super powerful tool. We can do all sorts of stuff." So when you sit down at Tableau, it feels like you're flying the space shuttle. And if you're a professional data analyst, that's great. That's the kind of tool you wanted. That wasn't what ThoughtSpot was about. We were trying to take data analytics into the hands of what I call mere mortals, also known as business users, people who didn't live in breathe this stuff every day.

(00:41:26):
So our goal with them was they could sit down and it was an approachable piece of software and they could turn on all the bells and whistles and power if they wanted it, so that was the second one. Start simple, let the users opt into complexity. And the third one was the entire product should look and feel like it came from a single mind. And this was a tenet to try to combat the natural tendency of enterprise companies to really fragment because you have all these different teams working on their incentive to work just on their little piece. And so they think about what's right for them and they don't back up to look at the whole thing.

(00:41:55):
And so we had this tenet, the whole thing should look and feel like it came from a single mind to just try to remind people, how does this fit into the whole system? And sometimes we need to go along and do things that work for the product that don't necessarily work quite the way we might want them to for our feature. And so those tenets were all... Again, they were all decision-making tools. And when we would have design debates, we could just come back to this, wait, are we actually starting simple and forcing them to opt into complexity or are we doing something else here?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:21):
So there's kind of this implication in this discussion about tenets is that you need to be very opinionated. There's a clear here's what's in and here's what's out. Is there anything more along those lines and are there other tenet examples you could share to give people some inspiration as they think about their potential tenets?

Bob Baxley (00:42:39):
It's very context specific, so it's a little bit like what are your tenets for parenting? It's a very specific personal type thing that's germane to your particular context. So I'm not sure if I have a lot of other examples, and I haven't heard this used by a lot of other companies, so I haven't been able to add a bunch of stuff. We tried to come out with tenets for individual features and we had trouble with that. It felt like they operated at sort of the design strategy level. And I just think that varies dramatically from company to company. What I would look for is if you're a design leader or a product leader, try to pay attention to what are the debates that we keep having over and over where people kind of seem to be digging in and things sort of seem to be bifurcating into two camps.

(00:43:23):
And then is there something we can do where we just have that debate once and for all, we decide as an organization, we're going left instead of right, and you're absolutely correct. You have to be opinionated, but that's how you're going to win. There's no unopinionated software that's been successful. You have to have a point of view. The question is, what's it going to be? So I'd say practically just try to look for places where it seems the team's having the same debate over and over and have it once, get it done, and put it behind you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:52):
And make it a tenet. And why is the word tenet versus principle so important?

Bob Baxley (00:43:57):
I don't know. I settled on tenet. I'd have to go look up the definition. I was trying to differentiate it from principles because I think principles are just... I describe principles as sort of Applehood & Motherpie. Again, they're just not something people are going to argue over. And so I didn't think it was wise to try to co-op that word and change how people think about it so much as I might be more successful just coming up with a different word altogether.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:24):
Makes sense. This entire episode is brought to you by Stripe. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that has a product in the market today uses Stripe to monetize it. $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of the entire global GDP. And Stripe isn't just a payments platform, they also have a product called Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of: OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies.

(00:44:56):
Stripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers no matter your pricing model, from simple recurring billing, to usage based billing, to sales negotiated contracts, collect and retain more revenue, automate revenue management workflows, and accept payments globally. Use Stripe to handle all of your payment related needs, including billing, revenue, operations, checkout flows, or simply launching or inventing new business models. Learn all the ways that Stripe can grow revenue for your business at Stripe.com.

(00:45:26):
Okay. I want to zoom out a little bit and another theme that came up a bunch when I ask people about you and how you think is that you have a really strong feeling that building great product and building successful product is a moral obligation of people that are in tech. Talk about why you feel that way and what that even means.

Bob Baxley (00:45:45):
Well, look, the example I use mostly is if you go to an airport and you look around, you'll see a lot of people using their phone to navigate that system. They're trying to figure out where their gate is, what time their flight's on, whether or not... Can they pull up their boarding pass, et cetera. And just watch people, watch their faces, watch the level of confusion and frustration. Some of them are tech superheroes like you and me and most of your listeners, but a lot of them are just mere mortals and they're not living and breathing this stuff all the time. And a lot of times they're super frustrated and then take that and scale it out to their entire day. And almost everyone living in a modern economy now is going to have hundreds of interactions with the phone or with a computer. And a lot of those interactions are going to be consequential.

(00:46:27):
Unfortunately, a lot of those interactions are not going to be great. They're going to be confusing and frustrating. When I'm speaking to live audiences, I often ask people, okay, please raise your hand if you've had a frustrating or confusing experience with software in the last month? And obviously every hand goes up. Okay, how about so far this week? Most all hands stay up. I'm like, okay, how about so far today? And most of the hands stay up, and it's often that I speak in the morning, I'm like, okay, everybody's had a frustrating experience with software and it's 10 o'clock in the morning. That's a problem, people, because each one of those interactions, it takes a little bit of energy away from you and it ramps your frustration just a little bit. And the bummer about software, both for the audience and for the creators is that it's an anonymous medium.

(00:47:10):
Nobody gets to see who's making these things. You and I together, we might be able to name six designers that have worked on products we care about. And the only reason we could do that is because a designer and I know a bunch of them. By yourself, I'd be surprised if you could name more than a handful. And again, we work in tech. So if you think about the billions of people out there that don't work in tech, to them, these products are just these crazy faceless things created by a bunch of people who knows where, and these products are causing them untold amounts of frustration and confusion, and it just takes away from their life quality. And I think we have an obligation as product people to put that emotional energy back into people's lives. They don't want to try to figure out how to navigate our login screens or go through our onboarding process, they just want to get home and spend time with their families and pet their dogs and have a nice dinner.

(00:48:02):
I just think every time we make a demand on the audience, that's a failure on our part. And so I do think it comes... I cast it in a moral way, and I talk about it that way because I don't think many people working in the industry understand the scale of what they're doing, again, because it's an anonymous field. We never see anybody on the other side of the glass.

(00:48:22):
But I think with this podcast, it'll go out to, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of people. If you and I saw all the people that will potentially listen to this in one place, we would think to ourselves, oh my goodness, that's like a lot of people. And we might think of it differently. We might behave differently. My team at Apple, but also my friends that are working at Facebook or Google or wherever, it's very hard to really understand that they're creating something in Figma on their computer that's going to be interacted with by billions of people, thousands and thousands of times. If you lose sight of that I think just, I don't know, you get sloppy and disrespectful is the wrong word, but I think you just lose sight of how much impact you're having on other people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:06):
Wow, that's really inspiring. That makes me want to build products and make them awesome. There's so much power to that. What this makes me think about a little bit is kind of random, but when I see someone click and watch one of my podcast videos on YouTube, I'm like, wow, that's one person that's going to spend their time watching this thing. Wow, I really want to make... It gives me more motivation to make these even better and better.

Bob Baxley (00:49:31):
Yeah, look, I think you have to find ways to go... You have to find where you go out of your way to see people using software in real time. I've worked on products that have been used by billions of people. I have friends who have touched billions of people. None of us ever get to see anybody use this stuff in the wild, in their natural state. Maybe we see them in a lab or something like that, but I've never seen anybody just randomly using even Pinterest. But there's ways that you can go and as a creator, as a maker, you can go and watch people using software in the wild. So just go observe people going through self-checkout at Target, which is the best self-checkout I've ever seen. Go watch that, then go watch it at some other grocery store where it's not as great and really notice what happens with people.

(00:50:11):
Much to my kids' frustration when their friends are over, I often grab their friend's phone and just sort of flip through it to try to understand how people are organizing their home screens and which apps they use. And maybe there's something in there that I haven't seen, I'll ask them what that is and ask them to give me a tour of it. I think we're living in a time where people don't do so many usability studies, so a lot of folks get pretty far into their careers without ever having watched mere mortals actually use software. Instead, we're relying on metrics and stuff, which I sort of joked that relying on metrics to understand what's happening at the user level is like looking at raw data from a radio telescope instead of just going out inside and looking at the night sky. You got to find a way to watch the audience.

(00:50:54):
Filmmakers can go to a theater, they can watch people, understand stuff. Comedians can go to a comedy club, they can start to develop an intuition about why people laugh. None of us have an obvious way to go watch people use software, so we don't really understand how humans process what's happening on the screen. And you have to just find ways to do that. And fortunately, software is everywhere. It's not just desktop or mobile software. I mean, there's ATM machines, there's ticketing kiosks, there's point of sale systems everywhere. I mean, go watch somebody over 70 fumble with a chip card insert or watch somebody try to figure out Apple Pay. And these are pretty seamless experiences and still there's cognitive friction in all this stuff. Just go rent a car and notice how long it takes you to figure out what the heck is going on with the dashboard. There's lots of opportunities to try to develop that intuition of how people navigate the human computer interaction, and we need to find ways to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:50):
An important element of what you're describing here, which I think maybe people miss, is that you're talking about just any software, not your own product, in order to start building your sense of taste and gut feeling for what-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:00):
Building your sense of taste and gut feeling for what works and doesn't work. And I had a guest on recently, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, founder of Vercel, and he had a really great phrase of something they do at their company. They have this kind of mission of exposure hours. Increase your exposure hours to people using our product. And then you can extrapolate that to any product.

Bob Baxley (00:52:26):
Yeah, well there's using your product, but I always think when you're watching somebody use your product, you come into it with a psychological bias that makes it hard for you to really see what's going on. So there's something about just understanding the audience and how they process information on a screen, not your product.

(00:52:40):
At one point when I was redesigning a checkout system, we did what I called a reality check, which was we held a traditional usability style exercise in a lab and all that sort of stuff, but we had the subjects come through and go through checkout in other products. So we watched them go through eBay and Williams-Sonoma and Amazon or something like that. And we learned a ton about checkout, about what was important to them, how it turns out ship quote is almost as important as price. Things that if we had been watching them use our own product, I'm not sure we would've picked up on, because we would've been sitting there yelling at them to click on the button. Or we would've had a bias and wanting to see the positive things. Whereas, if you just watch people that are using adjacent products could be super useful.

(00:53:22):
And again, we work in a medium, software is a medium, and we need to understand our medium in the same way. Again, musicians go to concerts, filmmakers go to movies, comedians go to comic clubs. When do people like you and I go watch people just use software? Where do we develop that intuition? And unfortunately I think you have to go out of your way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:42):
Talk about more about this idea that software is a medium. This is something that came up a bunch also in conversations with folks that have worked with you, that this is something that you believe.

Bob Baxley (00:53:51):
Yeah, you're so good with the research, Lenny. Yeah, look, so I left Pinterest in 2016, sorry, 2016. And I didn't have anything lined up so I had some time to myself and I was driving up and down the peninsula here in Silicon Valley meeting with other design leaders and just sort of commiserating with people. And you may remember there was a very consequential presidential election in the United States in 2016 and there was some impression that social media had had a significant impact on that election.

(00:54:22):
So I was kind of driving around Silicon Valley and I was just sort of wondering what the heck happened. I moved here in 1990 when the hippie ethos that was really at the core of Silicon Valley, and the hippie ethos was still very visible, it was very much a part of what was interesting to me about the valley when I moved here. But 2016 is a long time later and that hippie ethos had gotten pretty quiet.

(00:54:45):
And so I was listening to a podcast about the history of Silicon Valley by a Stanford group. The podcast was called Raw Data, and it was season two. And it starts off with an episode called A Monument to a Dead Child, which is about Stanford University, and it ends with Zuckerberg's testimony in front of Congress. And in the middle of that, they start talking about the counterculture revolution in the late 1960s in San Francisco and elsewhere. And they quote this book by a guy named Fred Turner, I think it is, the book's called From Counterculture to Cyberculture. And he has this quote that is, "you have to ask why it is personal computing got started in Northern California in the late 1960s when at the time every major tech company in the country was on the East Coast. And the answer is because there was a very small group of people in and around Stanford University that saw software as a new form of media on par with movies, music and books."

(00:55:41):
And when I heard that, all of a sudden I went, wait a second, boom. That is why I do this. I am fundamentally a maker. In high school I was a photographer, in college I was going to be a filmmaker, after college I went to music school. After music school I started a graphic design studio. I am a maker. And I realized looking back, I was just hunting for my medium. And it took me until I was 27 to find software as my medium. It's like, oh, I'm a maker that designs software.

(00:56:05):
And then when I heard that software as a medium, that whole concept of what I'd been doing with my life and who I was about, it just sort of all came together really quickly. And I realized, oh, I am into software because software makes me feel a certain way when it's working well. And what I find so troubling now is that a lot of time it's not working that way.

(00:56:27):
And I remember the first time I saw a computer, probably a lot of people on listening to the show can remember maybe the first time they saw a desktop computer, probably the first time they saw a pension zoom on a phone. You remember all that stuff. It was just freaking magic man. It was the future. It was so cool, and it just felt like the most amazing aurora borealis, or sunrise, or whatever. There was a sense of awe and wonder that filled me and probably a lot of listeners, that's probably the thing that motivated you to be in the field.

(00:56:58):
And so I realized software is a medium because there's an emotional component to it. Like a hammer and saw, they're not really pulling out an emotion for me. Maybe there's some, if you're a carpenter, but I don't naturally have an emotion with kitchen tools or things that I think even more sophisticated tools like calculators and pulleys, I still don't have an emotional response to them. But every piece of software I have an emotional response to. I either feel confused or empowered. I feel like my world's gotten bigger or my world's gotten smaller. They all have an emotional component. And I think once you realize and accept that, then you can say, oh, there is an emotional component to what we're doing with this product. I could just leave that to chance, which is what most people do, or I could try to be conscious of it and we could try to bring that into our conception of what the product's about and try to be purposeful in the emotion we're trying to elicit from the user. And I think that's where design and particularly visual design can have a huge impact.

(00:57:58):
So again, in many conversations that I'd have in design reviews, some executive would go, "I don't know, ultimately this just kind of comes down to a matter of opinion." And I was always like, "no, it does not. Whether we choose blue or red is going to elicit a certain emotional response from the user. What is it we want them to feel? And then let's make sure that we design something visually that evokes that emotion."

(00:58:21):
So again, I think once you really get your head around the fact that there are people on the other side of the glass, real live human beings having emotional moments with the thing that you're putting in their hand and that they're focusing their attention on. You are in those moments. And are you going to own it and show up and be the person you want to be in those moments or not?

(00:58:44):
A few months ago, I guess a little longer ago, I was talking to the team at Toast who makes the handheld point of sale stuff that they use in restaurants. And the thing I was trying to tell them, is whether or not you see it, tonight, you're going to be at dinner with a few 100 000 people all across the country. And if we take just one example, you're going to be at a very nice diner with a grandmother and her two teenage sons in Ohio, and the check's going to come and the waiter, the waitress is going to hand over the device to that grandmother, because she wants to pick up the bill. And you have the opportunity to either make her look like a superhero, because she knows what she's doing, or to make her look like a fool and one of her teenage grandsons is going to grab the device and do it for her.

(00:59:24):
You're at the dinner table, what are you going to do for grandma? You going to show up as well as you can, or are you going to just let this whole thing fall apart, because you didn't think hard enough about grandma? And that's true for Toast, that's true for every product any of us are working on all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):
This is so interesting and fascinating and inspiring. I was going to ask how you use this insight, that software is kind of the most powerful medium media more than even than TV and movies, and you shared it, which I think is really important. So just to kind of double-down on this, is the advice here is think about the emotion you want the user of your software to have as you're starting the design process, not just what do you want them to do, how fast do you want them to get to this flow, it's what's the emotion you want them to have?

Bob Baxley (01:00:09):
Yeah. I often don't think about what I want them to do. I just think that's sort of a selfish way to think about it. They have something they want to do. I'm trying to help them. I just don't ever approach these things of the user's something for me to exploit and take advantage of and manipulate. I know there's people that do approach it that way, which I think is a little unfortunate. But as a designer, I guess I have my own set of values and my own kind of compass on these things that's pushed me in a certain way of thinking about it. And so I'm kind of constantly asking what's the right thing for the user?

(01:00:44):
And I believe in my heart that if we prioritize that wonderful things will happen for all the metrics, including the money metrics that matter. I've never seen a product be successful that used metrics as a driver for what they were doing. I've seen a lot of companies be really successfully seeing metrics as a consequence and a way to evaluate the quality of their decisions, and then using those to triangulate and make better decisions moving forward. So they're kind of a very useful feedback mechanism. But I think there's definitely a risk to confusing, doing something because it's a driver versus something as a consequence.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:20):
There's a few more questions I would ask, but I want to come back to something that I asked earlier, that I think is on the minds of a lot of say founders and product managers listening to this. I'm just like, okay, this all is sounds really great. I would love to make these experiences so great. It's going to take us a lot of time to do this really, really well. You said that it doesn't have to. What's a tactical tip or two that you can suggest to a founder or product manager to help them contain the design process while also achieving these outcomes that you're describing?

Bob Baxley (01:01:53):
Well, I think if you can give... Maybe one way to think about it is like a big giant AI prompt. The more context you can give it, the more specificity you can give it, the more this is what I'm about and what we're trying to get to, the more the designer's going to be able to figure out which swim lane they're supposed to be in to produce something.

(01:02:10):
So I think if you're going into it feeling like the design process is going to take a lot of time, it's because you haven't been clear in your creative brief, so to speak, which often means you're not really clear in your own head. And I think... I have worked with a lot of founders, and we could identify a bunch of big companies, who I think got started that weren't clear in their own head. I don't want to... Yahoo was an amazing company, but if we just look at Yahoo for a second, I worked there, it was never clear to me what the founding vision of Yahoo was.

(01:02:39):
And I talk a lot about vision statements and we could say the vision statement of Google is organizing all the world's information. That's a great vision. They'll never achieve that. That's something that's always over the horizon. And it's been a very useful organizing principle for their acquisitions and how the company grows.

(01:02:55):
Amazon to be the Earth's most customer-centric company. Okay, great. That's a vision, they will never get there. It tells you how they're going to expand. Apple doesn't have an explicit vision, but I might describe it as personal computing can have a transformative effect on the lives of individuals. And I think that kind of focuses a lot of what they're trying to do.

(01:03:14):
Disneyland, still the best vision statement of all time, which is the happiest place on earth. So once you tell an employee this is supposed to be the happiest place on earth, then you're signaling all sorts of things about how they need to pick up the trash and how they need to show up on time and how they need to wear their uniform. You're just signaling a whole bunch of stuff.

(01:03:33):
So when I talked to founders, a lot of times they just don't have that clarity of what's the vision of the company. And to go back to Yahoo for a second, I never heard of vision. And so I'm not really sure what they were ever about. They kind of stumbled into the directory and then they added a bunch of stuff around the edges, but it never seemed to make a lot of sense. And so I think people operating inside Yahoo, it ended up being inefficient, because they were having to deal with all that ambiguity.

(01:03:54):
So I think that that can also be a pretty big risk for founders. They end up caught up with a product idea, and they think that the company is the product, the company is not the product. The product is the product and the company's bigger than the product. And you need to have some vision that speaks beyond just this particular thing.

(01:04:12):
I think Slack, honestly, both Slack and Pinterest I think are examples of products that became companies, but neither one of those places really knew what to do next, because they didn't have a bigger vision of the change they were trying to see in the world. So back to you, you were asking a very pragmatic question. I think you need to work on your prompt before you go to your designers and try to give them as much clarity about what you want to produce as possible. And I think if you leave it open as to the emotional response you want users to have, you're inviting a lot of ambiguity, which is going to invite a lot of inefficiency.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
I love that answer. And it's so interesting that AI can help us work better together as humans, because when you find that the AI is not achieving the outcome you want as effectively as you want, that's a lesson. This also translates the working with humans, make the prompt more specific, add more context in life, not just when you're talking to AI.

Bob Baxley (01:05:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:13):
I love that. That's so interesting. So the advice here is, if you're finding design is taking too long or you want to just level up your success with your design team, give more context, spend more time on the brief, on what you're actually trying to achieve. And make sure there's a clear vision or mission that everyone can row towards.

Bob Baxley (01:05:32):
Yeah. Look, design is a problem solving methodology. So the more variables you can remove before they go into the process, the more efficient it's going to be. And if you give designers a lot of ambiguity, they're going to spend a lot of time spinning around, and honestly, that's your fault as the client.

(01:05:48):
As a design leader, I think one of my main challenges is frankly trying to make the PMs better clients, helping them get more specific. It's very common for a design team to get extremely ambiguous asks from a product team. And the problem for designers, they have to take all that ambiguity and they've got to wring it all out. So when they give it to engineering, engineering knows exactly what to code, because computers don't tolerate ambiguity. Engineers need to know what the thing's going to be. And so design gets stuck with a really ambiguous input, but they have to have a highly specific output and then often timeboxed to do that. And it's just not a recipe for success.

(01:06:26):
So you're much better off either kind of compressing the PRD experience and bringing the designers into that, kind of co-creating with product and design really rapidly. But you need to... You could think of it in some ways as designers are going to draw the storyboards, and if you don't give them a great script, they're going to have a very hard time. And then you can't give the shooting crew ambiguous storyboards or you're just going to waste untold amounts of money on set.

(01:06:51):
So if you think about those three steps from script to storyboard to production, it's all about getting rid of ambiguity. And so the more ambiguity that can be removed upstream, the faster design's going to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:03):
This begs the question then, you don't want to give designers here exactly. Here's the thing we're designing, make it really great and pretty. There's always this balance of just give designers space to think and be creative and explore. Advice there of just how to navigate that.

Bob Baxley (01:07:20):
Well, if you go back to my example of the script and storyboard, scripts don't contain pictures, there's still a lot of opportunity to think differently and to come up with original things and to have a lot of creative input in the storyboarding process. So the script is living mostly in words, which is largely how PMs function.

(01:07:39):
The thing that I will say, to keep in mind for PMs, there's always a tendency on PMs to want to draw something and then try to give a sketch to a designer. And I would caution them against that. Sometimes they have to draw themselves so they can think it out. But if a PM came to me with something that was drawn and kind of fully baked, my response was like, thanks for giving me that. Now I know exactly what we're not going to do. Because as a point of pride, there's no way I'm going to go execute that exact thing.

(01:08:09):
So you're right, PMs have to give you the space to operate. And I think a lot of what they're trying to achieve could be done in more informal ways, conversationally and whiteboards, things like that. But yet you need to narrow the problem for the designers, they need constraints. They don't need a tiny little box, but they need constraints. Think in terms of, you don't give them an airport tarmac and you don't even give them a football field. You give them something more like a basketball court, a sort of scale at which they can do their design thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:45):
I want to talk about basketball later, but not yet. You've shared a lot of counterintuitive lessons on building product, designing, building teams, leadership. Is there another very counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products, hiring leading teams that goes against common startup wisdom?

Bob Baxley (01:09:04):
The thing I would say is that you should wait as long as possible to draw a picture. I think that pushes against all the gen AI tools that help you create prototypes. And there's obviously a lot of excitement around that. I can just give a prompt and the AI, they're going to crank out of UI for me.

(01:09:21):
So I don't think I'm using the term right, but I had this idea from art that I call the primal mark, and that's the first mark that you make on the canvas. And once you make that mark on the canvas, everything you do after that is in response to that mark. It sort of sets your baseline. And so for me, I always felt that as soon as we drew a picture that looked even remotely real, everybody gravitated towards that and said, oh, that's the thing. And people were so uncomfortable with ambiguity that they can't really deal with the tension of, well, that might not be the thing.

(01:09:53):
And so as soon as you draw a picture that looks even slightly realistic, much less something that comes out of one of these gen AI tools, everybody kind of goes, oh, that's the thing. You just keep doubling down on that thing. And what's happened is you've taken the possibilities from this big broad thing down to this tiny little thing from an AI system that's trained on existing solutions and existing ideas and is maybe not even thinking about it the right way, because all you've really given it is your first-order of thinking.

(01:10:22):
I think there's a way you can stay in these things conceptually and conversationally, where you can get to your second, third, fourth idea. And that's where stuff gets really interesting. And again, I don't think that has to take a lot of time. That can be over the course of a single meeting, you could get to a second, third, fourth idea. You just have to be willing to not jump at the first thing that looks like a possibility. You get that possibility, you go, okay, well that's interesting, let's table that. What else have we got?

(01:10:47):
There's one story that kind of related that's useful. In one of my previous jobs, I was responsible for the public website. I remember coming across one of the product managers one day and she's like, "Hey, this link on the home page, we have to make it blue." I was like, "Well, we don't use blue links anywhere." And she said, "Yeah, yeah, but we just have to make it blue." I was like, "Well, we're not making it blue." And a couple of days go by and I saw the home page and the link had been made blue, because she had got around me and she'd gone to engineering and just made it blue.

(01:11:11):
And I saw her in the hallway again. I was like, "What the hell's up with that?" And she goes, "Well, people couldn't see it." And I'm like, "Oh, they couldn't see it, so it wasn't prominent enough, right?" She's like, "Yeah, it wasn't prominent enough." I'm like, "Well, great. There's a 100 different things we could do to make it more prominent, one of which is making it blue, which is the thing that came to you first because you're not a designer, it's naturally... Because it's the most obvious thing, but it actually doesn't fit in with these larger things we're trying to do."

(01:11:36):
So I've often... I try to encourage the product managers to what's the problem with the thing? And then let us solve it. Don't jump to it and tell us... Don't tell us this is just exactly what we're supposed to do. And again, I do the same thing on the roadmap. You decide the roadmap, tell us what we're supposed to do, I will ask you about it, and I may push back and we may have some back and forth, but that's your responsibility. I'm going to trust that you are trained and you know what you're doing and you're going to make the right call. And I just want you to give me the same level of respect.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:06):
This advice about not drawing quickly and not making that primal mark, which I love that term, is, I'm curious your take on AI prototyping tools these days. Because that's the extreme version of that. Not only are you just creating a sketch, it's like, oh, it's working, here it is. Here's what it looks like. Thoughts on that, do you discourage people from doing that, PMs especially?

Bob Baxley (01:12:27):
Well, I think it's a production tool. Once you know what you want and you can give it a really robust prompt, then... I haven't played with it a lot myself, because I'm not in an operational role right now, but presumably it's really useful at cranking out that actionable prototype which you can click and experience.

(01:12:43):
And I've said for a long time that an interactive idea needs to be expressed interactively, so we're not talking with our hands and we can really understand what's going to happen. So when the idea is ready to be expressed, I think those tools are probably fantastic. But ideas start off pretty fragile, and the best ideas start off really fragile. And I think when you push them to develop too quickly and you put them out in the world and expect them to be able to stand up to critique too early, you're just going to squash them.

(01:13:10):
I often think about them like the little plant in the Pixar movie, Wall-E, you've got to give that little guy a little space, a little time, some water and some nourishment, and you can't really just suddenly put him out in the wind and think he's going to make it. And so I think a lot of... There's a lot of very fragile, interesting, quiet ideas that I think you need to give some space. And when you jump to the expression of them, I think you're putting them at risk.

(01:13:33):
I'll also say that, everybody, when they look at a prototype, what they're focusing on is the visual and textual expression. And so as soon as you produce something in high resolution the feedback you're going to get is going to be about colors and shapes and these presentation layer things, which are very loosely related to usability and value. It's like focusing on the special effects of a movie that has a really bad story.

(01:13:59):
And so at ThoughtSpot, we used to use what we call block brain diagrams, which were even simplified versions of wire frames. It was just big chunky blocks of here's how the screen could be and where things might be located. And because it was so low fidelity, people couldn't get into commenting on what it looked like. We had to talk about conceptually what it was. And so we were trying to build up this firm foundation where we could go from the block frames to wire frames to kind of the final expression.

(01:14:24):
And I think it helped us clarify what we were trying to do conceptually so that by the time we got to the final visual presentation, that stuff was actually really simple. And initially it made the product team really nervous because we would be sitting in these block frames and wire frames for sometimes weeks, and they'd be like, when are we finally going to see the comps?

(01:14:42):
And then what would happen, is because we had such a robust design system, once we locked down on the block frames, we could send it to an agency and they could do the full high-res comps in a day, because they knew exactly what they were doing. And so the PMs were always like, what the hell happened overnight? You're like, well, it turns out that the high-res stuff, that's not the hard thing. The hard thing is the heavy lifting of thinking, what are we really trying to do? That's the hard part.

(01:15:06):
And if you do the high-res stuff, you really muddy the waters. And I think you end up spending a lot more time churning, if you didn't... Again, I'm going to go back to the movie metaphor, because I studied film. If you're trying to fix script issues when you're in production or storyboarding, you're going to churn and you're going to waste a lot of effort. So you've got to figure out what you're trying to do before you go draw the high-res stuff. And I think a lot of the gen AI tools, it's this seductive thing of, hey, let's just go, let's go make the comp and see what we think. I don't really know if you're going to get anything great out of that process, maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:42):
That's a really interesting counter-narrative because it feels like every team now is just straight to prototypes. I just had the C... She's one of the CPOs at Microsoft. I realize there's many CPOs, and she has this concept of demos before memos and just prompt sets or any PRDs, you should just be prototyping all your ideas. And so it's interesting to hear the perspective of maybe it's actually hurting your ability to come up with a really clever solution versus the obvious solution.

Bob Baxley (01:16:10):
Yeah. Look, I think at some point, hopefully people just back up and ask themselves, are we actually producing better product because of this process? And we're going faster, but faster can't be the ultimate goal. You need to be creating something great as well, right? Something that's sustainable and frankly that you're proud of and your users find value in. And if you're just throwing so much spaghetti at the wall, I don't know if having a spaghetti throwing machine that goes faster is...

(01:16:35):
Look, there's a counter argument that's... You can say, oh, it's like Darwinian evolution, and we're just going to spin through a bunch of random mutations and see what happens. And I used to joke that it's true, that if you take a bunch of hydrogen atoms and give them 14 billion years, you could end up with a tiger, but you don't know you're going to get a tiger and you could get a six headed shrimp instead, and you don't really know when it's going to shift. So I'm not exactly sure Darwinian evolution is the way we create great product, but a lot of companies are making a run at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):
I want to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast called AI Corner. And in AI Corner, I ask guests to share what's one way that you've learned or figured out to use AI in your job to help you do better work, to help you do faster work?

Bob Baxley (01:17:17):
Well, my job right now is trying to figure out what my job is. And so the thing I've been using AI for is I've very explicitly been using it as a life coach. And so I had seen a couple of prompts about asking it what a blind spot was or what my strengths and weaknesses were. I'd seen some prompts about that stuff.

(01:17:34):
And one of them was really fantastic. One of them was, what's an outdated mindset that I'm holding onto that's not still serving me? And it came back with a very polite prompt or very polite response about, well, given your age and your profession, it's not surprising that you're very wedded to the idea of control, but that's not really the world we're living in anymore. And that's not probably going to suit the thing you're trying to do next, which is writing and publishing and speaking and stuff. And although it's statistically derived, it did come back with a really nice phrase, which I view...

Bob Baxley (01:18:00):
Although it's statistically derived, it did come back with a really nice phrase which I've used in your show, which was, try to focus on choreography over control.

(01:18:08):
And so I thought that was really useful. I asked for some of my blind spots, that was also useful. I use it for a lot of exercise input, that's useful. And the exercise that I've gone through most recently was I realized that it was inferring these things about me from the things that I had asked it to help me with in the past.

(01:18:26):
So instead, I just switched. I just went to ChatGPT, start a new project and said, I want you to be my life coach. I want you to ask me five questions a day for the next five days. Let's go through those so you can explicitly become better at helping me with this task.

(01:18:40):
And so we've just gone through that process and it's been really useful for me. It's no substitute for a therapist or a real coach or anything like that. It's not a human being. It doesn't care about me. I'm not saying that you should use it instead of these other options. You need a human being as well. But it's been very good at reflecting back to me things that I think have been floating around in my undermind.

(01:19:03):
So there's a wonderful book called Hair Brain Tortoise Mind by a gentleman named Guy Claxton. In that, he talks about the undermind. And sometimes you might've heard this as your unconscious or something like that. But I think of your undermind as the part of your brain that's processing information before it gets to language. And then when you go to consciousness, you've turned it into language.

(01:19:25):
And language isn't the full universe of things you can think, language is what you can think in English. And if you talk to multilingual speakers, they'll tell you that they can think things in other languages than what they can think in English.

(01:19:35):
So if you only speak English, you're only in one vein of what you could think, but your undermind is operating through all this other stuff. And for the computer nerds out there, you could think about it as a compiled code versus interpreted code.

(01:19:46):
So your undermind work in a compiled code and it could do a lot of stuff that you can't really do in the interpreted code which moves slower and has different orientations and we call that consciousness.

(01:19:56):
So I was feeding ChatGPT all this stuff over the last year or so, and there are all these patterns in my undermind that had been going into that I wasn't able to express with conscious language.

(01:20:08):
And so when I started asking it questions, I think what it was doing was it was statistically reflecting patterns back to me that already existed in my undermind, but because it was putting them into language, my conscious mind could now recognize them and respond to them.

(01:20:21):
And so again, as a life coach, I found it very useful as a mirror back to things that I was probably already thinking. And it helped me clarify my thoughts. It's not pushing me in new directions that a human might do, but it's still been super useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:38):
That is extremely cool. That is a really cool use case. I don't know if you've heard the Jerry Colona episode that I did recently. Okay, we'll link to it. He's got four questions that he suggests people ask themselves.

(01:20:50):
The first is the title of the actual episode, how are you complicit in creating the conditions you say you don't want? And this often leads to a lot of interesting insights about yourself, and there's an important part of it, complicit being like you're not responsible, but you're actually helping achieve a thing.

Bob Baxley (01:21:07):
It's a powerful word. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:09):
And then also it's an important element of say you don't want, you say you don't want to be busy, but something you just keep creating busyness for yourself, maybe you do want this. So anyway, we'll link to that episode. There's a lot of good stuff there.

Bob Baxley (01:21:21):
Yeah, that's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:23):
Okay, one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. This is one that I don't think you have any idea I'm going to ask you about. And so I'm curious where this goes.

(01:21:32):
This is a story that Joff Redfern suggested. I ask you. He told me that you're obsessed with space. You love researching space, telling stories about space. There's a story that you share about this guy named John Hobolt. Does that ring a bell?

Bob Baxley (01:21:49):
Oh yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):
Okay. Share that story because I think there's something really powerful here for people building products.

Bob Baxley (01:21:55):
So I should clarify, I am a fan of astronomy and space, but I'm a particular fan of the Apollo program because I view the Apollo program and the moon landings as the greatest peacetime accomplishment of mankind ever.

(01:22:06):
And I think it's an incredible... There's a profound number of leadership lessons and individual lessons to be learned from that program. And I've done multiple talks about this. I could go on for hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
Let's do it. Here we go.

Bob Baxley (01:22:22):
The particular question you're asking is John Hobolt. So, John was, I can't remember exactly where he was at the NASA hierarchy, but he was one of the people that was tasked with figuring out the question of how do you go to the moon?

(01:22:34):
So just to take yourself back in history a little bit, John Kennedy, president Kennedy goes to Rice University, I believe it's 19 September or May 1962, he gives the famous moon speech, we choose to go to the moon not because it's easy, but because it is hard, that whole thing, which I also have to say, and maybe a link to this in the show notes as well, everyone should go watch that talk. That is the perfect Ted talk.

(01:22:54):
It clocks in right at 18 minutes. It shows you how to sell a big, giant, bold vision. The specifics that Kennedy gets into the way he sets context at the beginning, the technical problems are going to happen, how much money it's going to cost, the way he puts the passion, why we're going to go to the moon, the whole thing.

(01:23:09):
It is an incredible talk. It's the only moonshot talk ever because a moonshot has to actually go to the moon. And so it is an incredible talk. So go watch the talk. But he steps off the stage and people at NASA are like, we've only recently put Alan Shepard into space.

(01:23:27):
And he just went up and went down. That was almost like it was a blue origins type thing that was just up and down. We didn't even do a lap around the earth like the Russians did with Yuri Gagarin. And now we're talking about going to the moon. Nobody knows how to go to the moon.

(01:23:40):
And there was three different options for going to the moon, one at the time, one was to build a big giant rocket and just go straight to the moon. It's called direct ascend. And the main advocate for that was Warner von Braun, who was the main rocket guy in the world. A little bit of a complicated past.

(01:23:53):
But nevertheless, Warner von Braun's a big guy. He is, got the president's ear. He's like, let's build a big giant rocket, go to the moon. People are like, yeah, the problem is when you get to the moon, the rocket's still super big. So these guys are going to have to descend a big ladder. That's a problem. So that was one idea.

(01:24:07):
There was another called Earth Orbit Rendezvous where you spend two spacecraft into Earth and then you link them up in Earth orbit and then one of them goes off to the moon, but you still got to land that thing on the moon.

(01:24:18):
And then there's a third idea called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, which is where you build a spacecraft that includes a smaller spacecraft. So you send up two spacecraft together, one of them's smaller, much lighter, and you use that just as the ship that goes down to the moon's surface and back up.

(01:24:31):
And that spacecraft is truly a spacecraft. It only flies in space, which means the engineering requirements around it are profoundly different because it doesn't have to survive re-entry into the earth. And so as a result, it can be much lighter.

(01:24:45):
And it turns out that the whole problem of landing on the moon is it's a weight problem. You got to lift all the stuff off the earth, which is incredibly expensive for fuel. You got to land it on. There's just a lot goes on. And so Hubert had come across this paper from a gentleman named Yuri Kondrachev who was living in Ukraine in the 1916, 1918 when he wrote this paper.

(01:25:05):
And he was the first guy to theorize Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. And I try to take people back to that. You and I can think about going to the moon, but Yuri Kondrachev in 1918 is on the plains of Ukraine looking at the moon, and he's actually thinking about how to really go to the moon.

(01:25:23):
He's figuring it out. And so he writes this paper, John discovers it years later, and John's trying to sell Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. It's not going over at NASA. And so eventually he decides to go around all the hierarchy and he sends a very famous memo to one of the top guys at NASA.

(01:25:39):
The memo starts somewhat as a voice in the wilderness and then it goes on. And then there's points in there where he's really emphatic, do we want to go to the moon or not? And then he goes through all the math of how going to the moon is all about weight and this was the only way to do it, and there was no other option, stuff like that.

(01:25:54):
He just made the case and he risked his whole career. The whole thing could have blown up. He could have been fired for going around the hierarchy and all that sort of stuff, but of course, he's able to champion the idea.

(01:26:04):
And I think it was another year or so after that famous memo, which you could read online, it's nine pages long or something. After the memo, it was still some time before they adopted Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, but eventually they do. And even with Don brought himself was very complimentary to ALT for pushing that perspective.

(01:26:21):
So I tell the story, one, because it's just amazing story and it does force you to go back to the moment of like, wait, they didn't actually know how to do it. We only know how to do it now because they've done it. But there's that moment of uncertainty and I think you have to embrace and be amazed at that.

(01:26:41):
And it also shows you the power of these ideas. A really great idea somehow finds a way to live on somehow it just sits out there and it just waits for its time. And Yuri had brought this idea into the world and it just sat around and then somebody it and dusted it off and was able to push for it and it came through.

(01:26:58):
Then maybe the third lesson is ideas need champions. They need champions willing to put themselves on the line for them. If you believe in something and you've made your case and you can really make your case, have the courage of your convictions and get behind it and fight as hard as you can for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:15):
Such a great story. I love that you summarize the takeaways too, by the way. So to me, the takeaways and the lessons here is one is coming back to your Pinterest board in the office, say the hard thing.

(01:27:28):
Two is be patient. It may take a little bit of time for a radical idea, especially to resonate and stick and get adoption. So if you're pitching a big new product idea, don't assume that they'll immediately agree. Also, just this idea of if you really believe in it, do go and champion it. There needs to be someone passionately arguing for this.

Bob Baxley (01:27:49):
Yeah, I'll just add to that one thing. I think people need to understand that they're advocating for ideas and not for themselves. And when I talk to a lot of designers that may be true for PMS, I hear a lot of people say that they're reluctant to post on social media or on LinkedIn or something because like, "Well, I don't want to be self-promoting."

(01:28:06):
And I try to counsel them like, look, it's not about self-promotion. There are ideas that you care about that you want to see succeed in the world. And so get out there as an advocate of the idea. It's not about you, it's about the idea. And don't be afraid to stand behind the idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):
We've spread a lot of good ideas in this conversation, Bob. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Bob Baxley (01:28:33):
Yeah, let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):
We added a ding to this. I like that drama you added and there's a whole thing now. Okay, first question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Bob Baxley (01:28:44):
So the three books I'm going to recommend, the first one's a beautiful poetic book about typography called The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst. Robert was the poet laureate of Canada. And the first 80 pages will change how you think about typography.

(01:28:59):
It will open you up to the wonderful world of typography that we all live in. You'll think differently about every sign you look at, about every movie credit you see, and it will give you an insight into the designer mindset. When you understand typography, I think you understand where designers come from and the best designers I know are just total type nerds. So highly recommend Elements of Typographic Style.

(01:29:23):
Second book, Zen and the Motorcycle Maintenance. Many people may know ultimately a philosophy book, but it's about the concept of quality, which I think is a very important topic. So it talks about quality and the importance of how things integrate into cohesive whole, which I believe is the main challenge facing most software teams. They create something that's highly fragmented instead of a single hole. So, Zen in the Motorcycle Maintenance.

(01:29:46):
And then the last one is a book called Time in the Art of Living by Robert Gruden. It's just a very interesting collection of impressionistic views of time and how time passes and what time means. So that's very different from the others and it's not something probably gets recommended on your show too often, but I think it'll help people in their lives in a powerful way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:10):
I think these are all brand new entries in this question. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Bob Baxley (01:30:19):
So I really enjoyed Severance. I enjoyed it as a filmmaker. I was just blown away at the filmmaking. I was intrigued with the story and the characters. And I think as someone who's worked in corporate America, when you understand that it's basically critique and commentary about the modern workplace.

(01:30:35):
There were times that I just thought were unbelievably funny and insightful. It was definitely interesting watching it with my wife who was an attorney and hasn't worked in those kinds of environments. So it was like an episode where some people got disappeared and the language that we're using was all around the language you would hear around a layoff.

(01:30:50):
And so I was laughing myself to death, but she was like, "What? What's going on?" So that's super fascinating and then I'll throw one other in there, which is not something I've recently seen, but something I highly recommend for everybody, which is Lords of Arabia. The Lords of Arabia is I think one of the two or three best expressions of the medium of film.

(01:31:11):
And so when you think about the ability to hold moving pictures, characters, story, music, photography, set design, costume, the whole constellation of variables that come to play into a movie, I think Lords of Arabia is probably one of the two or three most complete expressions of what the medium is capable of.

(01:31:30):
And I think it's useful to think about in technology, all the different elements of a product and all the different elements of a user interface and how you can break those down the way you can break down all these elements of a movie and how many pieces of software do we use where somebody is actually conducting that symphony in a really coherent, powerful, full on way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:52):
I love that movie. Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love?

Bob Baxley (01:31:58):
You're focused on recent and I'm just going to push back. No, there's nothing terribly recent. The stuff that I go back to, I'll give you a couple of nerdy ones. I have a Leica M6 cam, which is a film camera, and I recently started shooting with film again, which I absolutely love because it forces me to slow down.

(01:32:14):
I always talk about Leica cameras, they're obscenely expensive, but the thing about Leica cameras is you show up different when you shoot with a Leica. So when people think about cameras, they think about the quality of the image, they don't think about how the tool is going to change them.

(01:32:28):
When you show up with an iPhone, you're thinking about sharing. When you show up with a film camera, you're thinking about saving film and you're spending more time composing and thinking exactly about the shot. When you show up with a digital SLR, you just take a whole bunch of pictures and hope something's going to turn out.

(01:32:42):
And so I think these cameras are very useful metaphor for being conscious about how the tools you pick are going to impact the thing that you produce. So once you go into Figma, you've made a decision about the thing you're going to produce. If you stay in a sketchbook, you've made a different decision. If you go into something else, you've made a different kind of decision.

(01:33:03):
So I say the Leica M6 with film because of that. And then the software product I would point out, which is not terribly new, but I think it's worth noting, is a tool called Habitica. And Habitica is really fascinating. Ultimately, it's a habit tracker and task management app, but it's fundamentally a game.

(01:33:21):
It's a role playing game where you create a character and your character revolves and can buy armor and go on quests and things as you check off your habits and stuff. And it is the most interesting expression of shifting conceptual models that I've ever seen.

(01:33:35):
So if you think about a conceptual model, it's sort of the software equivalent of a genre in a movie. And so once you say it's a project management software, you're in a certain genre. If you say it's a productivity tool, you're in a certain genre. So if it's social media, you're in a certain genre. So these are different genres.

(01:33:50):
And Habitica is really interesting because it mixes genres, it mixes role playing game with to do manager. And so I think it's a really powerful example of how you can really shift the user's thinking in the same way movies for example. Star Wars is ultimately a cowboy movie set in space.

(01:34:07):
And when you come to those two genre mashups are really interesting. When you come to a rom-com, you have a certain expectation of what's going to happen to a rom-com. If somebody suddenly got shot in a rom-com, that would not make sense to you in the same way that if somebody made a really funny joke in a John Wick movie, it wouldn't make sense.

(01:34:23):
So I think Habitica is just the most interesting example I've ever found is somebody really doing a fascinating mashup of conceptual models, which is... Sorry, I'll stop. It's an unexplored and unexploited possibility of software ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:38):
I love how profound this lightning round already is. The point about Leica changing the way you even think about the photo is so interesting, I've never thought of it that way. You mentioned Star Wars. Have you seen Andor by the way?

Bob Baxley (01:34:50):
No, but my wife, everybody's raving about it. I've been watching basketball, so I just haven't had the spare time yet. But okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:57):
I have a basketball question, but first of all, before we get to that, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work in life?

Bob Baxley (01:35:04):
Yeah, so there's three quotes that I come back to all the time that I repeat in most of my talks. First one I've already used, which is, design is clear thinking made visible, by Edward Tufte.

(01:35:14):
Second one is from the American landscape photographer, Ansel Adams. And I've also alluded to this and the quote is, there's nothing worse than a brilliant image of a fuzzy concept. And then the last one is an African proverb and it goes like this, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

(01:35:31):
And I think we've touched on all three of those things today when we've talked about the resolution of comps, we've talked about using gen AI to try to go faster, things like that. And those two ideas collide in interesting way.

(01:35:44):
People think if they cut their colleagues out of the pie, they can go faster. And it's true, they can go faster. You just can't go very far. You need a group if you want to go far. And just because you can create a brilliant image doesn't mean you got a good concept.

(01:35:58):
Go look on Instagram, you'll find plenty of photographs that tingle your senses from a visual perspective and you will forget them by the time you close the app because they don't mean anything. And so we live in a time when it's very easy to produce things at incredibly high production values, but they don't mean anything. And so they're just like fancy potato chips. There's no nourishment there, man.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:21):
I love that this connects back to the vibe coding apps and prototypes that people build, but you can do it really quickly, but it won't go too far, potentially, not to hit on those tools. They're amazing.

Bob Baxley (01:36:34):
They are. All this AI stuff is profoundly amazing and I will encourage people, one of the most amazing things for me about this moment in AI is that this, the kind of AI we're experiencing has been theorized for well over 50 years.

(01:36:46):
So there is a vast warehouse of interesting, amazing thoughts from philosophers and engineers and social scientists and people thinking about what is this moment going to mean when we have this sort of artificial intelligence that challenges our conception of what it means to be human.

(01:37:02):
So there's so much stuff you could be reading to help you process this moment in the very intense and profound psychological challenges it's bringing forth.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:13):
It definitely feels like we're finally living in the future. The future's actually happening. It's going to be robots walking around soon. We get self-driving cars all over San Francisco and it's really stark.

Bob Baxley (01:37:22):
It's a future. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):
It's a future. Well, that's my concern with a lot of the fiction of the future is most of it is dystopian and here's all the problems that we're going to run into, which is going to be useful. Here's the robot laws that we got to be thinking about.

Bob Baxley (01:37:37):
Just to go back to this idea of how once you create an expression of something, people baseline off of it. I recently got to hear Henry Modisett who's head of design at Perplexity, give a talk. And one of the things he said that just really struck me was that people's conception of AI was founded, was put out there by Hollywood years ago.

(01:37:56):
So this idea that AI is going to take stuff over and is ultimately really dystopian and malevolent towards humans and stuff like that, it's actually something that's created by Hollywood and now we're trying to outlive how and stuff like that.

(01:38:11):
And so it's just such a great example of somebody put the concept out there and planted that seed in people's heads and now we're struggling to get people off that baseline and to look at it with fresh eyes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:24):
That's a really good point. It's much more entertaining to watch AI try to kill us all, not just, oh, everything's amazing. Great job, AI.

(01:38:34):
Okay, final question. I know you're a huge sports fan. In particular, you're a big Warriors fan. So let me just ask you this. Say you were running the Warriors, the owner of the Golden State Warriors, what would you change? What would you change to help them win?

Bob Baxley (01:38:49):
A real team can't be dependent on a single player. And I think there's such a dramatic difference in the Warriors when Steph is on the court and off the court. If you listen to the local announcers, they're always like, "These non-Steph minutes really matter."

(01:39:05):
I look at that, I'm like, that's not really a team then, right? That's Steph in the band of Merriman. And the Warriors are bigger than that and most of these basketball teams are bigger than that currently. I think across a lot of places in the NBA, there's a single player that can go down that makes a difference in the organization's success and that just seems dangerous and not a team.

(01:39:28):
So I don't know what to say. I don't know how you replace Steph Curry. He is a singular, if you even call him a generational player, it's a bit bigger than that. He is unequivocally the greatest shooter in the history of the game and he's one of only two or three players has actually fundamentally changed how the game's played.

(01:39:45):
But I just know for winning, the Warriors are at risk because Steph is meaningfully old for an NBA player and you can't have the whole franchise built around just him.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:58):
I love this hot take. A great way to end it, Bob. I can listen to you all day. This is so fun and interesting in so many ways on so many levels. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe learn more about what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?

Bob Baxley (01:40:14):
So, Bobbaxley.com is the easiest place right now. It's just a bento site, but I'll get some more stuff up there in the coming days, hopefully before this episode goes out. We'll see.

(01:40:21):
But there's plenty of links there that'll help you connect to me on LinkedIn and some of my talks and a few Links to some other things that I find useful. Just find me on LinkedIn. I publish pretty much every day on LinkedIn, so that's an easy way to find me.

(01:40:34):
I'm happy to be connected to whoever is interested in being connected. And then in terms of how you can help me, I'll go back to what I said earlier. It's not really about me, Lenny, it's about these ideas. It's about the idea that software matters, that we're making something for people on the other side of the glass and that it's a way that we show that we care and that we should care.

(01:40:52):
So it's not about me, it's about us together trying to create a digital world that we want to live in. The digital world right now, it's not something we really want to live in. It's not a place any of us would turn our kids loose in. You and I talked about this earlier. The digital world's not safe for our kids. Have we done something wrong? So I hope people take that responsibility more seriously and try to help clean things up a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:22):
I think we've made a dent in that. Bob, thank you so much for being here.

Bob Baxley (01:41:26):
Thank you so much, Lenny. It's been a real honor, privilege, and just a ton of fun. So thank you so much.

## Transcript

Bob Moesta (00:00:00):
I think one of the biggest misconceptions around Jobs to Be Done is this notion that it's pain and gain as opposed to context and outcome. When you hear somebody's story and it seems irrational, like we'll have people go, "Oh my God, that's an anomaly. That doesn't happen." But what you realize is that the context makes the irrational rational. So the moment you hear a story, you go, "I can't believe that," nine times out of 10, it's because you don't have the rest of the story. And so part of it's being able to understand the rest of that context that would drive somebody to say, "Why would somebody cut their arm off?" Well, if they're in this situation and this and this and this, there's nobody who would say they want to cut their arm off, but in certain situations you'll do it. And so that's what we're trying to do is find, where will people change behavior?

Lenny (00:00:38):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Bob Moesta. Bob is the co-creator of the Jobs to Be Done Framework alongside Clay Christensen. And as you'll hear at the top of our conversation, is maybe the most anticipated guest I've had based on the LinkedIn response. Bob has started eight companies and is currently the co-founder and CEO of the Rewired Group, and currently spends his time helping companies of all sizes unlock hidden insights and create successful products and services.

(00:01:12):
In our conversation, we get deep into all aspects of the Jobs to Be Done framework. What is it, how to apply it to your product, when it's not a good fit, how to interview customers to get accurate insights into their struggles, plus examples of how Jobs to Be Done works for zero to one products and a ton more. Thank you to everyone who suggested questions and topics for our conversation. Enjoy my chat with Bob Moesta after a short word from our sponsors.

Bob, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Bob Moesta (00:04:08):
Thanks, Lenny. Excited to be here. Big fan.

Lenny (00:04:10):
Ah, I'm a big fan of yours. I wasn't even super familiar with you before we started organizing this podcast chat.And then as you saw, I posted on LinkedIn what questions people had for you and around Jobs to Be Done in general. And I've never seen so many comments and questions and so much passion for guests I had on, I think there was over-

Bob Moesta (00:04:30):
Really?

Lenny (00:04:30):
Absolutely. There's, I don't don't know, 130 questions and comments and folks like Jason Fried, founder of 37signals and Des from Intercom came out and just like, I'm excited for this episode, so we got some here.

Bob Moesta (00:04:45):
I've worked with all of them, they're great people and fun to work with.

Lenny (00:04:48):
I just had no idea there's so much passion for Jobs to Be Done. I have a million questions for you, a lot of them coming from the audience, some from me. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of this stuff.

Bob Moesta (00:04:57):
All right, let's dive in.

Lenny (00:04:58):
Okay, so I thought it'd be useful just to start with the very basics briefly, just what is the simplest way to understand the Jobs to Be Done framework?

Bob Moesta (00:05:07):
I think the easiest way to think about it is that I'm an engineer, electrical, basically have been building product for almost 30 years and one of the lies I was told growing up was build it and they will come. And so we always think about it from a technological, how do I build this thing? And all right, who wants this product? And what I realized very early in my career is that really it didn't work, I couldn't make it work.

(00:05:31):
And so Jobs to Be Done is this whole premise that people hire products, they don't buy them, they hire them to make progress in their life. And if we can take a step back and look at it, we see it in a very different light to realize at some point they're in some context and there's some outcome they want. And if we can understand that, we start to realize that different things compete, right?

(00:05:51):
A simple example is think of Snickers and Milky Way, right? They're both candy bars, they're both bought in the checkout aisle, they're both made almost with the same ingredients, one has peanuts, one doesn't. And if you start to compare the products and do a competitive benchmark, you start to get to one's a little softer, one's a little harder, one's got a few more calories, one's got less calories. But when you talk to people about when's the last time they ate a Snickers, when time's the last time they ate a Milky Way, you start to realize that Snickers typically is a case where they missed the last meal, they've got a lot of work to do, they're running out of energy and they want to basically get back to the tasks as fast as possible. And so you start to realize that Snickers is about almost like a meal replacement and it's about the stomach is growling and things like that. And you start to realize that if they didn't have a Snickers, it competes with a protein drink, it competes with a Red Bull, a coffee.

(00:06:49):
But a Milky Way typically is eaten after an emotional experience, could be positive, could be negative. It's usually eaten alone, and it's taking time to regroup after this emotional thing. And you start to realize that it competes with things like a glass of wine, a brownie, and to be honest, a run. And so when you start to realize that, jobs helps you see the true competitive set from what we call the demand side of the world as opposed to the competitive set from the supply side of the world, which is the technology or the underlying business model by how which we're making it. And so it allows you to actually see what customers really want as opposed to trying to figure out, how do we sell things to people?

Lenny (00:07:29):
To maybe follow up on this example a bit, how often do you find these jobs emerge after they've developed a product, in this case I guess Snickers or Milky Way, how often is it just like they see this problem and actually apply this approach even accidentally?

Bob Moesta (00:07:44):
What's interesting is that at least for me, the thing is what I learned was that supply and demand are not as connected as everybody thinks. Most people think they create a product and that creates demand. But the real thing that if you start to study causality is that a struggling moment causes demand. And you start to realize that in some cases that struggling moment exists and can exist for a long time and nobody solved it. So one of the companies I helped was Southern New Hampshire University and Paul Le Blanc. And one of the things in 2010, we found basically these anomalies, these people who were going to school but not actually coming to class and watching everything online. And it was like 50 or 60 of them and the anomalies basically, and they're paying full price, they didn't want to come. For Paul, it was kind of like why are they doing this?

(00:08:29):
And when we went to study them, we realized that they actually had a very different job than a typical 18 to 24 year old because one, they were a little bit older, typically they had either already had a degree or they basically had tried to go to college and it didn't work. And it was about basically time now that they had responsibility to do something new. And so they didn't actually build the product at all. And as they started to look and say how many people want to go back to school but can't? They started to realize it's not a thousand people, it's not 10,000 people, they have over 200,000 students. They're one of the largest universities in the world. And so all of this starts with a struggling moment, not with a product.

(00:09:06):
And so that's what we mean when we're customer-centric is that we're studying the struggling moments they have and people like Intercom and Basecamp, they look at struggling moments and that becomes their roadmap. Because again, think about a roadmap. I'm literally trying to tell you what I'm going to build in the next 24 months, for example, but none of us saw ChatGPT coming. And so all of a sudden I have to go undo the roadmap. But if I talk about the struggling moments that I'm trying to go after, all of a sudden I realize that the roadmap is now when I get to that struggling moment, there's multiple ways I can solve it. So instead of just talking about features, it's typically talking about features for the first 90 to 120 days, but after that we just talk about struggling moments because that's the seed for real innovation and basically where new products come from.

Lenny (00:09:51):
To unpack the framework a little bit more, if you were to come to a founder and tell them, "Hey, you should be paying attention to struggling moments," I feel like all of them will say, "Yeah, we know that. We do that. We look for pain and we try to solve it," so what I'm curious there maybe is just what is maybe the right way to do it?

Bob Moesta (00:10:07):
But it's not just the pain. See, what we're taught in business school was pain and gain, but the reality is it's the context. It's the fact that I didn't eat lunch before, the fact that I still have a lot of work to do, the fact that I have this podcast going on. It's not that I'm in pain, but it's the context that makes me value this in the moment that much more than something else. And so part of this is it's not just about pain and gain, it's about context and outcomes.

(00:10:34):
And so when you frame it that way, it becomes a vector, a vector of progress or a vector of intention of what they're trying to do. And once we frame that, then we can actually wrap technology around it. And the crazy part is that I was always told or taught if I build the best product, it will sell better. And what I've learned is that actually a kick-ass half is better than a half-ass hole, and that's what Jason talks about. But the reality is like if you look at QuickBooks, QuickBooks has half the features and double the price. And you start to realize that at some point in time it's about meeting customers where they are, not trying to wow them and not trying to convince them. They convince themselves to make the progress.

Lenny (00:11:14):
I'd like to understand this vector piece more because that feels really important. So you were saying that it's not just there's a pain point, solve that, what you're saying is what's even more important is this context around that pain point and things that precede it?

Bob Moesta (00:11:27):
Yeah, so the first thing is we don't talk to people who just want to.

Lenny (00:11:34):
For people listening on the podcast, Bob pulled up a drawing, so you should try to check out the YouTube video of this to see what he's doing.

Bob Moesta (00:11:42):
So there's some Product A is the old product and there's some Product B, which is the new product. And ultimately people don't randomly do anything. And so the real heart of the method of Jobs to Be Done is understanding the causation of what pushes people to say, "Today's the day I got to do something different." And the push or the context they're in has nothing to do with the new product, it's the only reason why they would leave the old product. And if there's no push, they can't even see your product because we're creatures of habit, right? And so as soon as I have a push, I call that F1, force one, and I have some idea of what's possible, then I create something called F2, which is basically the pull to a new outcome, a new state, a new thing, right? And so at some point in time it's like I have to be in this situation and I have to want this outcome, right?

(00:12:34):
But here's the other part is that there's this waterline that there's these other forces and there's two other forces. Every time I show somebody something new, it actually creates anxiety, right? Anxiety of the new, and I call this F3, right? And then the other thing is I have to get them to leave old thing. So I call this habit of the present. And what you start to realize, and I call that F4, is if F1 and F2 are not greater than F3 and F4, they're not going to move, they're not going to do anything. And so ultimately what we're doing is we're framing the market as a system of behavior. And most people say, "If I just add more features, create more pull, people will buy." It's not true. More features create actually anxiety, can it do all those things?

(00:13:24):
And what you start to realize is if I reduce friction, which is the bottom part, I actually don't have to do anything with a product, I just have to make easier. So for example, one of the things I did is I built houses and one of the frictional points that people had in moving was the fact of moving house was basically packing all their stuff up and going somewhere. And so I would literally sell them a condo, they'd go from a 3000 square foot home to a 1500 square foot condo and they'd cancel six weeks later because they didn't know how to get rid of all their stuff, which is a frictional point. So what did I do? I actually raised the price of the condo, included moving in two years of storage as part of the deal with the condo because it's the frictional coefficient and I increased sales over 30%.

Lenny (00:14:06):
I love that.

Bob Moesta (00:14:07):
So what this is it's really about focusing on the customer. It's about understanding the causation behind it and then using design thinking to actually start to realize, how do we actually enable people to make progress? We don't need to sell them, we need to enable them to buy.

(00:14:24):
And so I wrote a book called Demand Side Sales that basically took the premise of stop trying to sell people and just help them make progress, help them buy. And so the whole book is instead of trying to base the sales process on how we want to sell, we need to actually design the sales process on how they want to buy. And it seems like it's the same thing, but they're actually really, really different things.

Lenny (00:14:47):
Is there an example that can make this even more real of a company or a product?

Bob Moesta (00:14:51):
So one of the companies I work with a lot lately is a company called Autobooks, they're based here in Detroit. And basically they help banks basically do invoicing through let's say Apple Pay. And so instead of having to use Square or PayPal, you literally can use your bank now to do these things. And so there's two things, they have to sell small business on it, but they also have to sell banks on it. And when we started talking about it, they talked about why do banks want it? And the first thing we did is we found out there's three really different reasons why banks want them.

(00:15:22):
But the thing is that where the process looked at is they would talk about the struggling moment, they talk about what was going on and then everything was about getting them to a demo. And once we got them to a demo, we had to close them. Well, it turns out that the buying process literally has different phases in it. There's the first thought, there's something called passive looking where they're problem aware and solution unaware and they have to learn a bunch of things, and then there's active looking where they're both problem and solution aware and they're trying to figure it out and frame a solution, and then there's deciding which is about making trade-offs.

(00:15:53):
And so what we end up doing is when I started to talk to the team about it, what they started to realize is I said, "Where is the customer in their timeline of buying?" And they looked at me like, "Huh?" I said, "No, no, you have a timeline of how you want to sell to them and after the demo you try to close, but what if they're actually in passive looking and want a demo to learn more? It's very different than if I'm trying to close." And so what we ended up doing is breaking the demo apart, asking people where they were in their buying process. And by doing that we actually then found out a way in which to give them three different demos, one about telling stories and giving them the background about the problem, another one about showing them all the alternatives, and then the last one is about basically giving them choices between ways to move forward, right?

(00:16:37):
And you'd think that it would make the sales process longer, it actually made the sales process almost half and at 4x basically conversion because now we meet them where they are as opposed to where we want them to be.

Lenny (00:16:52):
And is that something you find generally in the sales process, there's these three phases that everyone goes through and you got to think about them individually?

Bob Moesta (00:16:59):
Yeah, there's actually, I call them six phases. First thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, first use, and then ongoing use. How do we build the new habit? And so if we don't actually study that part of how do people transform themselves through a struggling moment, we don't know what they want. If I talk to people who want to buy a house, they tell me they want granite and hardwood and they'll make everything these things they want.

(00:17:25):
But when you actually talk to people who bought a house, they actually made a lot of trade-offs. Although for example, everybody I would survey before buying a house, I had 93% say they wanted an Energy Star compliant house. It cost 30 grand to make an Energy Star compliant at the time. And the reality is nobody bought it, they all bought the finished basement. And so there's the difference between what they say they want and what they want.

(00:17:48):
And so the method itself is not based on traditional research or market research, asking people what it is. It's actually based on criminal and intelligence interrogation about telling me the story about how you decided today's the day I bought a house or today's the day I went back to school. It's not random. And if it's not random, then we need to actually find it. And that to me is one of the bigger differences, most people build their sales process on probability, "If I get so many leads in, I'll convert so many to here to so many..." But the ultimate thing is, how many people are really ready for your product? They have to actually be ready for it. And that's what Jobs to Be Done is really about, is understanding where they are, what's causing it, and how do they make the trade-offs?

Lenny (00:18:30):
So let's follow that thread of interviewing and talking to your potential customers and customers to understand the jobs to be done. What is the actual process you recommend?

Bob Moesta (00:18:39):
The first thing we do is we frame a question. And the way I think about it is most people, so the one thing to know about me is I've been building things for over 30 years, I've worked on 3,500 different products and services across many, many industries, but I've had three close head brain injuries before I was seven years old and I can't read and I can't write. And so one of the things for me is that I could not understand the research that I would get from marketing around basically they'd say, "Hey, I need something that's easy, fast and fun and cheap." And I'd be like, "Okay, what does any of that mean? What is fast? How fast is fast and what's not fast?" And you start to undo all those things.

(00:19:18):
And so the first thing we do is we start to frame, let's just talk about what causes people to say today's the day they want to go on vacation or today's the day they wanted a new set of windows. And you start to frame around that, and then you go find people who recently purchased and say, "What in the world happened that says today's the day I need new windows?" And you start to realize that there's pushes and there's pulls and there's anxieties and there's habits. And so the first thing we do is we try to extract the story from the customer. And it doesn't have to be my product, it could be somebody else's product if I haven't built it yet. It's like, what are people going to fire when they hire me?

(00:19:55):
And so when we get the stories though, then the stories are going to get us the pushes, the pulls, the anxieties and the habits, the trade-offs and what we call the hire and fire criteria. And then what we do is instead of trying to look for themes across all of them, we actually do something, instead of segmenting them, we cluster them, we find the pathways because what you start to realize is it's not one reason why people do it, it's sets of reasons. And those sets actually work together. So the pushes work with the pulls. So when they have these pushes, they want these pulls. And when they don't have these pushes, they don't want those pulls.

(00:20:29):
And so when you start to see the patterns and you start to pull it out, you start to realize that most companies or most products are hired to do 3, 4, 5 different jobs and they're in conflict with each other. One person wants to go faster and one person wants to be more thorough. And so all of a sudden being more thorough means it's slower. If I say we're thorough, the people who want it fast say, "I don't want this because it's too slow." So how do you frame those things out and understand where the conflicts are behind it and think about different products from it?

(00:20:59):
That's what Intercom did, right? Intercom realized that people hired it for four very, very different reasons and then instead of building four different products, they literally took their product and turned off the features that were not relevant to the pathway that people wanted to take. So for acquire, they didn't need a whole bunch of these other features and so they actually framed it around basically, how do we help people convert? And that job actually competed with HubSpot.

(00:21:24):
There's another one where it was about helping with support, and that one competed with Zendesk. And so they changed the pricing model to basically match who the competition was and to match the progress that people were trying to make because Zendesk was too much and too hard, and HubSpot felt like it was an overkill for where people were. We basically figured out how to actually position ourselves as a good next step between HubSpot adds nothing or between nothing and HubSpot. And that's how they've grown to be valued over 2 billion.

Lenny (00:21:56):
I have a follow-up question, but did you say that you can't read and write?

Bob Moesta (00:22:00):
Yeah, can't read and write. So the thing is I cannot read the words that I write and I cannot read... So if somebody reads it to me, I can actually play it back. So I'll listen to audio. But the fact is the way I was taught to read is so that when I look at a paragraph, I see the spaces between the words first, and then I usually see the left-hand edge of the words, so the last three letters. And so my mom taught me to look at the five largest words on the page by circling the longest words on the page. And then I would study those and translate those and then figure out what those five words would have in common. Because for me, the part that's broken in my brain is that I can't look up things fast enough. So by the time I try to look at a word, figure out what it is, get the definition, I've literally forgotten every word before it.

Lenny (00:22:53):
Damn. How are you writing books?

Bob Moesta (00:22:55):
It's a gift. I'm telling you, it's a gift. It's a gift I'd never wish upon my children. But to be honest, it's given me abilities to see patterns in so many different ways because I can remember the first five words in the first paragraph and the last five words in the last paragraph so I turned through a book three or four times, and I have as good a comprehension as everybody else.

Lenny (00:23:14):
This is insane. How are you writing books?

Bob Moesta (00:23:19):
It's really simple, I have a company called Scribe Media, and what we do is first thing we do is we look for what struggling moments do people have? We then look at what are the competitive books wrapped around it? I then basically outline what progress looks like. We then take each chapter and define it as a system and what we have to do in each chapter to help them make the progress along the way. And then we just talk and we talk, we have ten two hour sessions, they get recorded, and then somebody basically takes... So if you listen or read any of my books, it sounds like me talking because it is.

Lenny (00:23:56):
Wow.

Bob Moesta (00:23:56):
And so I can get a book out in three and a half, four months.

Lenny (00:24:00):
That's incredible.

Bob Moesta (00:24:01):
And so now I'm a teacher, I'm adjunct lecturer at the Kellogg School at Northwestern, and then I guest lecture on the East Coast in kind of different business schools, and then I help Techstars and Y Combinator. So I'm really moving myself into being into, I feel it's time to pass on. I've had some amazing mentors who helped me, and again, I was told to be a baggage handler or a construction worker when I graduated high school, and my mom thought I could do more. And so I met these people who poured their knowledge into me to enable me to do all this stuff so now I'm trying to pay it forward as much as I can. So that's one of the reasons why I do as many podcasts as I can. So again, I appreciate you having me.

Lenny (00:24:42):
Yeah, this is a great opportunity to pass it on and so I'm very happy we're doing that. I had no idea about any of this about you, so thank you for sharing that.

Bob Moesta (00:24:52):
It's been fun. I pinched myself. The other part is I don't know how I got here. One of the things that I've been doing is I've been studying people for the last 10 years around why they switched from one company to another to literally understand the jobs of jobs because employees actually hire companies more than companies hire employees. And so you start to realize the struggling moment is why don't we have enough people? And otherwise I want to leave, but I don't know how to leave. And so I'm in the midst of writing a book around that right now with Michael Horn and Ethan Bernstein.

Lenny (00:25:23):
Is there an insight from that work that you can share about why people leave jobs or join jobs?

Bob Moesta (00:25:27):
So the number one thing that I would say is almost everybody when you ask them about how they got the job they're in, the number one phrase you get is, "It was so lucky. I was so lucky, just happened to fall in my lap." And then when you actually unpack the story, luck had nothing to do with it. They were prepped, they were ready, there was pushes, there were pulls, there was anxieties, they were able to do it. And you start to realize, and the funny part is that if I talked to somebody who's been through three or four kind of switches, they all can say, "Yep, I've had that job. Yep, I've had that job. Yep, I've had that." And so there's frames around basically understanding what progress are you really trying to make now? Is it, do I need balance? Am I not challenged enough?

(00:26:08):
And you start to frame it, and when you frame it, you start to realize, I'm willing to actually take less money to be around smarter people because I want to be a founder later. And so you start to realize that all of these things where we think we have to pay more money, over 50% of the people who got new jobs didn't get more money. It's a lie. It's about progress. It's about what do they want to learn? What skills do they want to get? At some point it's about money, but it's not always about money.

(00:26:37):
And the other interesting part is when you talk about money, we talk about this notion of unpacking. We'll say, "Well, why do you need more money?" It's like, "Well, I have larger obligations," or, "I want more money because I want more respect." And so what you realize is in the hiring and firing criteria, they talk about money, but money actually has a bigger effect than just money. It's about respect or it's about responsibility or it's about their metric of progress. There's a whole bunch of things, but it's not just money. That's the interesting part.

Lenny (00:27:09):
Yeah, I've definitely done that myself, there's a status component to your job.

Bob Moesta (00:27:14):
Yeah, I want the title, right? Happens all the time.

Lenny (00:27:18):
I want to come back to the discussion we were just having around interviewing people to understand the jobs to be done. And a bunch of people on LinkedIn were trying to understand just tactically what they need to get right in order to get accurate jobs. So I guess, are there just a couple tactics you'd recommend for how to interview people?

Bob Moesta (00:27:37):
Let me give you three tips. The first tip I'd tell you is go read Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss. I started to write a book around basically techniques that I learned back in the eighties and nineties around this, and his book is amazing around it, the whole notion of getting to know. I play things back incorrectly because they're going to say no, and I'm going to say, "All right, fix it," and then they'll talk more. The moment somebody says yes, there's nothing more to say. And so there's a bunch of techniques you have to learn to basically get them talking.

(00:28:09):
The second is I only talk to people who have already tried to make the progress, right? So for example, people talk about like, "Well, you can't apply this to something that's new. It doesn't exist." So I worked with a company that was, let's say a fairly large social media company, and at some point in time they found people kind of transacting on their platform, but they didn't know anything about it and they hadn't built anything. And what they ended up doing is we ended up going and studying eBay and Etsy and what caused somebody to say, "Today's the day I'm going to set up an eBay store or sell something on Craigslist." And out of that, we found all the jobs of what people, both sellers were doing and buyers were doing, and now I think it's I think almost a $3 billion marketplace that didn't exist and they learned about it all from the competitors.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Sounds like Facebook Marketplace, maybe? No comment?

Bob Moesta (00:29:01):
I didn't say that.

Lenny (00:29:03):
How many interviews do you recommend people do to get to a confident?

Bob Moesta (00:29:07):
That's a great controversial question. The interesting part is from a causal mechanism perspective and from a set theory perspective, meaning the sets of pushes, pulls anxieties and habits, it starts to repeat around seven or eight. And I usually do 10, no more than 12. And I would rather do two rounds of 12 interviews than do 24 interviews. I had some really interesting mentors, one of them was Dr. Deming, who's the father of lean and quality systems and like that. And so he would always push me to basically how to do things faster and smaller. And so that's where a lot of it came. And you just realize that people will say, "Oh, we have to do something statistically significant." Well, you do if you're doing it randomly, but if you actually understand the range of your market and you know that 50% of it is above 30 years old and 50% is below 30 years old, I could actually sample in a way that makes me get a good representation without having to actually do 50 interviews. And so we use something called design experiments to help with that.

Lenny (00:30:07):
I love the concrete numbers. And so along those lines, when you're actually asking questions of people, do you have any best practices and ways of phrasing a question to get a response you can trust?

Bob Moesta (00:30:18):
In a lot of cases, you have to look at it from multiple perspectives. And so the other tip I have is to not have a discussion guide. It drives people crazy because everybody wants to ask the same set of questions, but the problem happens is when you ask the same set of questions, you actually don't follow the ones that actually have the most meaningful information in it, right? And so what happens is, what I say is I use the framework of pushes, pulls, anxieties and habits and say, "What caused them to do this?" And everything else is just a conversation of trying to understand their story.

(00:30:53):
And so part of this is being able to ask the questions around why, but you can't ask "Why, why, why, why why?" It's like, "Tell me more about that. Give me an example." And in a lot of cases, I usually get them to what I call the edge of language where they have no more language, and what I do is I literally then bracket it, "So was it more about this or more about that?" And I know it's neither one of those, and it forces them to talk more, right? It's always trying to get them to know, because the moment I get to... So when I play it back, "So you did this and this and this and this," and say, "No, that wasn't it." And the people who I'm working with are like, "You know that's not the right answer," I'm like, "I know, but they're going to elaborate on why it's not that." And so it's literally being able to reveal kind of the causal mechanisms of why people do what they do.

Lenny (00:31:41):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams, companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:32:48):
When I think about Jobs to Be Done, I've never fully implemented any sort of structured framework, but I find that it's been really useful in my newsletter work and my podcast work, just thinking about what is the job my newsletter is doing for people? For me, it's helping people get better at the craft of building and growing products. And I just think of it, there's these buckets of jobs to be done and then there's this formal, "Let's just do it for real." I guess, one, do you find that to be true? There's the very simple and there's the more official?

Bob Moesta (00:33:14):
So what I would say is I find a lot of founders, especially really successful founders, like I would say Jason Fried is one of those where he intuitively understood this. He actually thinks this way but didn't have language wrapped around it, right? So I think that it's a very useful framework. I think that the danger you run into is that when you look at the customer through the product, so if I look at the customers through the Snickers bar, then I think of Milky Way as a competitor. But if I look at the customer and say, "Why did they pick that thing?" Then I realize that a protein shake and an apple and a sandwich are the competitors not Milky Way.

Lenny (00:33:53):
Got it. So say someone wanted to start going in this direction of Jobs to Be Done, what is the simplest, I don't know, first version, lightweight approach to starting to think this way?

Bob Moesta (00:34:04):
So there's two things. If I have a product, go find 10 people who recently bought your product, but what I want you do is go talk to them, not about the product, but about why they bought the product, what was going on, what were they hoping for, what were they worried about? What did they have to give up? How did they convince somebody else? Just listen to the story. Start with just getting the story.

(00:34:26):
Because there's three levels of information we have to get or three sources of energy that I talk about. So think about it as there's got to be energy in the system for us to do something. And there's what I call functional energy, which is usually time, space, effort, knowledge, right? There's emotional energy, which is how I feel. I want to feel better, I feel frustrated, I feel overlooked. There's emotional aspects to it. And then there's social aspects, how I want others to perceive me or how others perceive me, "Oh, my boss is going to fire me because he doesn't think I'm doing this fast enough and I feel inadequate." So part of his understanding kind of the emotional, social and functional components that are part of that energy source.

Lenny (00:35:11):
Got it.

Bob Moesta (00:35:11):
The second part is if it's an established product and it's been there a while, I'd actually go and talk to people who churned. Because in churn, what's interesting is when somebody leaves your product, they're still making progress. We think it's bad for us, which it probably is, but in their mind it's like, "Yeah, this was too hard and complicated," or, "You know what? It didn't do enough for us." It allows you to actually understand the struggling moment they had because, again, they were using your product and something happened and some context changed and now they struggle with it, and now they got to go find something else.

(00:35:43):
Nobody wants to change. So that makes this actually the easiest thing to look at is tell me why people change. We just seem to literally not want to go deep enough and we use the lazy word of random and probability as pseudo for knowledge, and it's not knowledge. It's literally just if context is the same, if outcomes is the same, then I can do it. But if I listen to football stats, third down in preseason is very different than third down in playoffs, right? And so giving me a stat about how their third down conversion is across the whole season makes no sense to me because the context is different.

Lenny (00:36:25):
You brought up this point that people often say they really hate something and it comes across that they're ready to switch and will use something that you've built that's better, but they don't because of that friction you mentioned. What do you look for that might tell you that they're really actually going to use it for real and it's that serious?

Bob Moesta (00:36:43):
The very first thing I would say is I never trust anybody telling me things they're going to do because they can't assure it, and it usually never happens. It's my experience that says that. And so the thing is, I need to talk to people who did something and tried and though they might've failed, what made them try? So the phrase I have 'Bitchin' ain't switchin'." Just because people bitch about something doesn't mean they're going to do anything about it. This is where at Basecamp, we learned the fact that everybody said, "Oh, if you had Gantt charts, I'm going to leave you if you don't put Gantt charts in or resource allocation," and as much as they all say they want it, they're not leaving because of it.

(00:37:23):
And this is the other part, if you follow your best users, they'll take you up to this world that then actually destroys the lower end of the world of why people are there. And so if Basecamp would've added all those things, one of the reasons why people join Basecamp is because it's so dang simple. And if I start to add all these things that make it more complicated, it doesn't work.

Lenny (00:37:43):
And so in those conversations, is there something you find that just this is a sign they're actually really serious, or do you just like, "I'm not going to listen to anything they're saying in this case until we actually build it and they're using it"?

Bob Moesta (00:37:55):
So for example, in the first five minutes of an interview, they're going to tell you, "I bought a new car because I got a deal on it and it was a car I've been dreaming about forever," and it's like they have all these things and then when you start to get to, it's like, no, the old car had 280,000 miles on it. You had three large bills in the last four months. The fact is it's making a sound and you've got a long trip coming up, that's why you're getting a car. You're not getting the car because of the deal. And so there's these, I call it the layers of language. And the very first layer is called the pablum layer, where people just, "How was your day?" "Oh, it was good," but nobody knows what that means. And if you ask one further question, "Well, what was good about it?" They're like, "Ugh."

(00:38:34):
And then you get to the next layer, the next layer is usually the fantasy nightmare layer, "Oh, it was so good because of this," or, "Oh my God, it was so bad because..." They exaggerate to one degree or the next. And then what you want to do is actually then pull it back to what actually happened. This is where you've got to be more of an investigator and an interrogator. And the way I would describe it is it's criminal and intelligence interrogation that feels like therapy because most people don't actually know why they bought because they only think about the time they wrote the check, swiped the card. But the reality is like I did an interview with somebody who bought a coat rack, $137 coat rack. It took them 18 months to buy it. And in their mind, they say they bought it in a week, but the reality is the debate about getting it and why they couldn't get it was happening for over 18 months. So this is where you can't believe what they say, you have to do your investigation to get there.

Lenny (00:39:32):
And what does that phrase use again for that vector of progress?

Bob Moesta (00:39:36):
The intention, it's the context that they're in and the outcome. So here's the thing is that most people talk about you want to get to this outcome and people value this outcome, but value is not just the outcome. Value also has where you start. So if I start here and I end here, I'm going to value it this much. But if I start down here... Wait, I've got to get there, start down here, and I go up here, I value it that much more. And so part of it is value is actually part of where they're starting from and where they want to go. And most people say, "If I just get them up here, they're really going to love it," but some people say, "I just want to get here." And so you're overshooting it and they actually want a price discount because you're giving them more than they want.

Lenny (00:40:16):
So I'm going to go in a different direction. The most liked comment on LinkedIn asking people what question to ask you was by Sharam Krishnan, who's actually on this podcast in the past.

Bob Moesta (00:40:27):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember seeing it, I remember hearing it. By the way, I think it's one of the reasons why I reached out because I'm like, "Okay, we need to clarify this a little."

Lenny (00:40:37):
Okay, great. So you saw the brand, he's not what you'd say a fan of Jobs to Be Done.

Bob Moesta (00:40:41):
No, no.

Lenny (00:40:43):
And so here's the question he wanted to ask, "Is there a case of a startup or a modern technology company or any company that was using Jobs to Be Done to launch a product from zero to one that has had broad adoption?" That's his challenge.

Bob Moesta (00:40:56):
Inside the company or broad adoption that the product that we've developed had broad adoption?

Lenny (00:41:01):
The latter, yeah, the product has done really well.

Bob Moesta (00:41:03):
I already told you an example. I can't say it, but you can. The thing is, for example, Autobooks is another one that did this, right? They start to realize that the fact is you need to study the struggling moments and it helps you determine what not to build, right? Too many times we just keep adding more and more things to the product. And so in larger organizations it's very difficult because at some point the dominant market research is about hypothesis testing, "I'm going to go build a hypothesis and go basically then go build a research project to prove or disprove that hypothesis."

(00:41:44):
But the reality is, Jobs to Be Done research is hypothesis building research. I don't know, that's part of the point is we really don't know. We think we know, but Dr. Taguchi would always tell me there's way more unknown than there is known and never forget it. And so again, what causes people to buy windows is not what we think it is. And so you start to realize that. I think Drucker said it best, he goes, "What businesses think they're selling is not what customers are buying." And to be honest, he said that in 1953, and it's still true today. I just did interviews today where they're like, "Oh, people are buying for this reason," and we did 12 interviews and you started to realize, nope, that's not why they're buying. And they're shocked.

Lenny (00:42:30):
Awesome. Okay, so you didn't say it, but maybe Facebook Marketplace?

Bob Moesta (00:42:33):
So Autobooks would be one, you're trying from zero to one from nothing, right?

Lenny (00:42:41):
Yeah, brand new product is kind of the question there.

Bob Moesta (00:42:42):
Yeah, so at Techstars we basically make sure that everybody, they come in, they usually don't have a product to start with, at least in the Chicago and San Francisco offices. We basically have do jobs in the very, very beginning of that. And we have companies like Nutrisense and Havoc Shield, and there's a whole bunch of them that are out there that are growing and going down that pathway. And so to me, it's very, very useful, especially in the zero to one space.

(00:43:08):
But the notion is the way that I frame it is, what will people stop using when your product comes out? And that's who you want to go interview. So for the Marketplace thing, it was like, "Hey, I want them to stop using Craigslist. I want them to stop using eBay. I want them to stop using Etsy." If that's the case, what are they doing and how do I do it better than that so I can understand? There are really no new jobs, it's just the fact is we get better at them. And so the hire and fire criteria get better, but the context and outcome, most jobs, I can look back 10 years in the job existed and I can look ahead 20 years and the job's going to exist. It's just the nature of how the technology delivers on it is what gets better.

Lenny (00:43:51):
Awesome. And it sounds like Intercom and Basecamp also are very early Jobs to Be Done adopters?

Bob Moesta (00:43:57):
Very early, yeah.

Lenny (00:43:59):
So I think with Sherom, something that I read between the lines is he worked at Twitter for many years and I think Twitter attempted at Jobs to Be Done framework, and I don't know if it went well and I think it just caused a lot of people to think this is a terrible framework.

Bob Moesta (00:44:10):
This is where I think there's different flavors of it. And what I would say is that one flavor is really what I call very supply side driven, where it takes the underlying technology and then looks at it and says, "All right, what else can we do? Where can we be better? Where are things that are important but we're not satisfying on them?" And being able to prioritize. And so there's a very systematic approach that's hundreds of steps and very, very prescriptive in nature.

(00:44:38):
The method that I have and that I've been using mostly because I've been in the startup world and doing new to the world type stuff is it's very, very qualitative, organic, and it's a combination of a process, practice and skills. So every company actually has its own innovation process based on who they have, who they're serving, the underlying technology. And so, in my opinion, to have a very predictive one process that fits across everybody, I think there are principles, but I don't think there's one process. And so I think that's what they used at Twitter.

(00:45:16):
The other thing is that I think Jack was actually a big fan and he worked with Clay on a couple of things, but I don't think they worked on the method part of it, they worked on the thinking part of it. And so it was more about, so one of the most dangerous things you can do is sit in a room and hypothesize what the jobs are because I will guarantee you you're 100% wrong. And so this is what happens, by the way, this is the gift of dyslexia is I'm not an A student and so most A students don't start until they know the answer, most D students start because they don't know the answer. And so you start to realize we're wired very differently to do that. And so I always say that the A students have a disadvantage against the D students and entrepreneurship because we just go start and we learn right that in there. We don't have to hypothesize everything first because we actually don't know how to do that.

Lenny (00:46:09):
So your advice there is essentially people often get Jobs to Be Done wrong because they just sit around and think about the Jobs to Be Done and aren't actually doing the work to interview and understand?

Bob Moesta (00:46:21):
Yeah. They think more about the outcomes and they think about what's the best outcomes we can get for people. And what you start to realize is that there are trade-offs people make. And ultimately there's some irrational piece, some irrational component that makes everything twist around. The irrational component is like, why in the world do people eat Snickers when they're hungry? It's a candy bar. Well, it turns out when you bite it, it masticates into a ball and it sits in your stomach and it absorbs the acid that's causing you to say, "Hey, I got to eat something." And so part of it is the roll of the peanuts and the roll of the nougat is actually to masticate it together. The caramel should be sticking it together versus in a Milky Way, the melting temperature of the caramel is so light that you take a bite, it's liquid, you drink it down, you swallow it like it's a drink, it has nothing to do with food.

(00:47:13):
And so you start to realize that it's connecting the experiences to the context and outcome. It's connecting the supply side with the demand side, but it starts with the demand side first. Struggling moments and opportunities all exist before there's a product.

Lenny (00:47:31):
You're making me hungry.

Bob Moesta (00:47:34):
I bought a couple, but I didn't use them, but I bought a couple. And I mean, you go deep into it, you start to realize that this is the crazy part, everybody thinks they compete, but if you literally go back to a moment when you picked up a Snickers bar, you were not thinking about a Milky Way. You weren't thinking of half the candy aisle, you were thinking of like, "Do I want a sandwich, or do I want a Snickers?" Half the reason why they picked Snickers is it's 300 calories, I can eat it in three bites, it's done, it's not messy, and I can keep working. It's mainlining food.

Lenny (00:48:05):
I don't know if I've ever had a Milky Way to be honest.

Bob Moesta (00:48:05):
That's right.

Lenny (00:48:05):
So I don't need that comfort.

Bob Moesta (00:48:09):
That's the funny part is you go to all the big tech hubs in San Francisco and the Snickers are all empty and the Milky Ways are all full.

Lenny (00:48:17):
Yeah, I get that. You mentioned that there's two different approaches or many different approaches to the Jobs to Be Done framework, and this is a question someone actually asked that there's maybe a framework by someone named Tony Ulwick, and then there's your approach, and then maybe Clay Christensen maybe has an approach. So can you just help clarify?

Bob Moesta (00:48:34):
So Clay and I collaborated on it. So I was lucky enough to have Clay as a mentor for 27 years, I met with him once a quarter for 27 years, and at some point I shared with him the hack of how I was thinking about this and what I was doing, and at some point he said, "We need to turn it into a theory." To me, it was more like my work around because I couldn't read and write, "Let me go talk to some people, I'll figure it out." And ultimately we turned it into a method. So if you look at Competing Against Luck, it was written with Tady Hall and Karen Dillon, Dave Duncan, but I helped on that book for 16 months. Some of the clients in there are my clients. I think Intercom is in that one. So Clay and I are aligned in that. Clay was more about turning it to a theory and I would say I'm more about having it be a method. So his is like a thinking framework and a philosophy and a strategic kind of frame where mine is very tactical about how do we get it and then what do we do with it.

(00:49:31):
Ulwick's comes from a very different perspective, and again, I think it's very valuable, but it comes from the notion of functions and it's more like, what can our product do? What jobs can our product do? As opposed to the way I look at it is basically only people have jobs, products don't have jobs, people have jobs, organizations don't have jobs, people in organizations have jobs because that's the irrational part. And so fundamentally there's that two different views of how do we look at it, but ultimately I would say Clay's approach and my approach are derived from the same dataset where Ulwick's is derived from a different dataset and a different set of experiences.

Lenny (00:50:13):
That's super interesting, I had no idea about this. And your sense is in the case of Twitter, for example, maybe it's closer to Clay's just think about it approach.

Bob Moesta (00:50:20):
Yep, I think that's right, I think that's right. And again, I think Ulwick's is very valuable, especially in some companies where there's lots of risk, there's regulation, there's lots of moving parts, very complicated systems, but at the same time it's so many steps. You have to have a very disciplined organization to follow it.

Lenny (00:50:40):
If someone wanted to start actually following through on this, which book would you recommend they start with to help them understand how to apply your approach?

Bob Moesta (00:50:47):
I would have them read Demand Side Sales, and it basically is starting from the theory of why do people buy and how do we actually understand how to flip the lens from trying to sell people things to help them buy? And ultimately it has the entire method around it kind of frame for product and for founders.

Lenny (00:51:05):
Awesome. Is Jobs to Be Done ever not the right framework for people to figure out what to build?

Bob Moesta (00:51:11):
Oh yeah. So couple places, one is when there's no choice or there's no real choice. So what's interesting is think about is why do you know more about your car insurance than your health insurance, right? And most of it is because your health insurance is given to you by your employer and you only utilize it when you're sick. But the car insurance, you have to pay for it so you have to sit down and decide what are the different trade-offs you're going to make where when you do it for the employer, it's good, better, best. And it literally is like, where am I my life? Have I been sick? There's some basic things, but there's no real choice there.

(00:51:48):
And so you start to realize where there's no real choice or where people want to make the choice obvious, it doesn't work. You have to be able to accept how people see you as opposed to how you want to be seen. So when companies will come to us and say, "All right, I want you to find these jobs for us," like, "Nope, I can't do it because it doesn't work. I can tell you what the demand side is asking for and then we can see how your product fits to it and what you have to modify to it, but if I try to help you build the case to make the jobs what you think they are, it doesn't work."

Lenny (00:52:21):
In those cases, is there a different framework you recommend or is it just like you don't really have a lot of options?

Bob Moesta (00:52:26):
In a lot of cases to me, I'd do some ethnography, I'd literally figure out kind of where there's frictional points in the system. I might do some prototyping around kind of different alternatives, but typically it's more about what I would call the little hire or how do they use, for example, the health insurance as opposed to why do they buy the health insurance.

(00:52:48):
The other example I could use is chewing gum. If I talk to people about buying a pack of chewing gum, most people can't remember at all when they bought a pack of chewing gum, even if it was in the last week like, "Uh, I think so." But if I asked them when they chewed gum, they can tell me about when they chewed gum. And ultimately that will then imply when they buy gum. If you go to something that it doesn't register, it's so deep of a habit that they don't really know what they're doing, you'll never going to be able to get that information out of them. Again, the habitual stuff is very hard to see the job. It's only when people change do you see, it's like you can reveal the entire iceberg but if I've been using Tide for 20 years and I ask you why do you hire Tide, you just make it up. You have no idea why you Tide. But if you switch from Tide to Gain or Gain to Tide, you can tell me that story very detailed.

Lenny (00:53:41):
There's a reader who has the really interesting question, Maria Delano is her name. She's wondering, with a framework this well known, you're bound to get people misinterpreting it and repeating inaccurate information about the framework, and she's curious what misconceptions most frustrate you that you just hear again and again about Jobs to Be Done?

Bob Moesta (00:53:59):
The first thing I want to say is actually, in doing it, I've explicitly made it very accessible because the moment you make it too copywritten, too patented, too whatever, people just move by it. So part of it was being able to make it in the public domain so people could have conversation and try it and do different things with it.

(00:54:21):
What I would say is there's enough people that have used it and have worked with it and have had great success with it that at some point in time, most of the people who are trying it and not using it well, it's obvious. And so it'd be lik, how do you double down into it? I think one of the biggest misconceptions around Jobs to Be Done is this notion that it's pain and gain as opposed to context and outcome. And that I think one of the other ones is it's purely about the outcome and not just about the context and outcome together.

(00:54:51):
And again, I think the biggest mistakes I've seen made is because they do it in a conference room and they don't go talk to people. They don't actually find the contradictions, they don't find the irrational parts. What's really interesting is when you hear somebody's story and it seems irrational, like we'll have people go, "Oh my God, that's an anomaly. That doesn't happen." But what you realize is that the context makes the irrational rational. So the moment you hear a story and you go, "I can't believe that," nine times out of 10 it's because you don't have the rest of the story. And so part of it's being able to understand the rest of that context that would drive somebody say, "Why would somebody cut their arm off?" Well, if they're in this situation and this and this and this, there's nobody who would say they want to cut their arm off, but in certain situations you'll do it.

(00:55:37):
And so that's what we're trying to do is find where will people change behavior? Most people are studying the momentum of where people are and what's the momentum of their direction, but the reality is what we're trying to do is study what causes people to change their direction. And that's where innovation happens. Innovation happens when people change.

Lenny (00:55:58):
What convinced you to spend your time and life working on Jobs to Be Done and helping people implement this framework and what keeps pulling you back?

Bob Moesta (00:56:08):
That's a great question. So I think I started out as I just love to build things. My mom would take me, basically we have something around here called Big Trash Day is where they throw out the dishwasher and they throw out the old mini bike and all these different things. And my mom would basically say anything that we could fit in the trunk, we could bring home. And so I've been building things my whole life because I've been just always fascinated with how things work. So that's the first thing.

(00:56:38):
The second part is I love to help people. One of the things I realized is I can't build products for myself, and I've done seven startups, but I realized that I have to build for others. And so to me, building for others was where I started product. And then I realized that I'm a method builder and that I really help people innovate. And so I exist to help make the abstract concrete. So that phrase has helped lead me to becoming now a teacher and a professor and writing books is something I never wanted to do because I hated books. Clay convinced me that I had to learn how to speak and I had to write books.

(00:57:18):
So here's a really good one is that this is in 1990, so one of the things that happened was when my youngest kid moved out and basically moved out of the house, I had my notebooks from almost 30 years of every project on everything I worked on any company, and this is from one of my mentors, Dr. Taguchi, he said this in 1990 when I was living in Cologne, Germany. He said, "Write a book." So I opened this 30 years later, I'm like, "Oh, dang it. I got to write a book because he told me to." So it's just one of those things where I realized I really like helping people, I like creating methods. I'm very curious, sometimes annoyingly curious, but that's kind of the triad of things that I love to do.

Lenny (00:58:06):
Amazing. Bob, is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on or make sure we cover before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Bob Moesta (00:58:14):
There's three big things to take away. One is struggling moments is the key and it's struggling moments that people take action on. And what I would say is they're everywhere. They are freaking everywhere in our lives and there's only certain contexts when all of a sudden we realize we have to do something about it. So study struggling moments because at some point that's where we need the innovation the most. The second thing is think about the progress people are trying to make. What is their standard, not your standard? What is that context? What is that outcome? And the last thing, the way I phrase it is choose what to suck at and figure out the trade-offs that you need to make and make sure that your trade-offs map the trade-offs of the customer. Because nine times out of 10, most products that fail is because they made a trade-off that the customer didn't agree with.

Lenny (00:59:06):
Awesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Bob Moesta (00:59:12):
Yeah, I'm ready. Always ready for these.

Lenny (00:59:14):
Perfect. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Bob Moesta (00:59:19):
Shape Up by Ryan Singer, it's phenomenal. The other book I would say is End of Average by Todd Rose. I listen to it every single year. I get something on it every single year. I've been listening to it for probably eight or 10 years. I literally called Todd, I've become friends with Todd. We interact on a regular basis. It's an amazing book.

Lenny (00:59:39):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Bob Moesta (00:59:42):
I love Big Bang. I watch it every... People would say that I'm Sheldon, I think I'm more Leonard, but I can see there's days that I come across as Sheldon, I don't mean to be Sheldon. But I like Oppenheimer. I think any of the science type, I'm not really a science fiction person, but it's more about, I'll say historic documentaries, I love them all because they help me understand the science.

Lenny (01:00:10):
What is a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?

Bob Moesta (01:00:14):
What are the top three things you struggle with in your business today that if you could solve would fundamentally change the business?

Lenny (01:00:22):
Love it. What is a favorite product you recently discovered that you just really like?

Bob Moesta (01:00:28):
I recently purchased a massage chair, and it's one of those things where I've been getting massages for a while, and as I get older and I'm working out more, I've lost almost 100 pounds. And so I'm to the point where I'm working out more and God, nobody told me I'm going to be cold all the time, I'm sore all the time and I'm hungry all the time. And so it's like, "Okay, I need a way in which this..." So I would get a massage every two weeks or so, and now I can get a massage in 20 minutes on demand. And it's pretty freaking amazing.

Lenny (01:00:57):
Man, my wife has wanted one of these and this might be good for her.

Bob Moesta (01:00:59):
Oh, I will tell you, it's a life changer. It is one of those things where we'll do interviews and I can go do an interview and a debrief, pop in and do it. And I'm brush as I can be. It's better than an app.

Lenny (01:01:15):
Is there a brand you want to throw out that you found to be your favorite?

Bob Moesta (01:01:18):
Kyoto is the one that I have.

Lenny (01:01:18):
Kyoto.

Bob Moesta (01:01:20):
I got it from Costco. It's fabulous.

Lenny (01:01:23):
Okay, we'll be looking into that. What is something relatively minor you've changed in how a company has implemented Jobs to Be Done that has had a big impact on their ability to do it well?

Bob Moesta (01:01:33):
There's two. One is Intercom. So the way that Intercom really took off and why it did so well is actually, it was Des Traynor and Eoghan McCabe who were the two founders, they actually studied, they came to one of my workshops in the beginning, but they studied it and they tried to do it, and then we talked about it. But then they brought Matt Hodges and Paul Adams and Sean Townson and the executive team, and they did the interviews. And when they did the interviews, they understood what to do and it literally all went downhill from there. And they knew how to ask the questions.

Lenny (01:02:09):
Downhill in a good way?

Bob Moesta (01:02:10):
They knew how to do the interviews way. It was kind of amazing. And Paul Adams and Matt Hodge's first day at Intercom was in my office in Detroit. So that to me is one of the key.

(01:02:23):
The other is to find a place in a very large organization where a group is struggling, they can't deliver product, they can't move fast enough, they keep getting the wrong insights, they say it's going to be this big, and literally focusing on a very small area and giving them a little space to demonstrate the use of it, and then it will spread with a case study or two. And so most companies, if they start small case studies and sharing it with people both when it works and not works, or starting with the top.

Lenny (01:02:56):
Two more questions, one is, someone asked me to ask you the dining room table story. Does that ring any sort of bell?

Bob Moesta (01:03:01):
Yeah. So one of the things I did is I built houses. So before I built houses, I was running a venture capital, private equity firm. We had about 100 million. I was doing 25 transactions and just traveling too much, I had four children. And so my wife and I kind of had the conversation that I wound it down and I said, "What am I going to do?" I wanted to try and find a business I could work in and be part of and own part of so I joined a building company here in Detroit, and we ended up building a thousand homes here in Detroit and had 14 sites. And one of the things we did is we built for downsizers like your parents. And one of the things they constantly told us was, "Look, we're downsizing. We're not having the holidays. We're done with that. I don't want a dining room table, so we can't even have people over. If we're going to do it, we're going to go somewhere else. I don't want the dining room table."

(01:03:50):
And so we made, it's a two bedroom, two and a half bath, first floor laundry, gourmet kitchen, kind of amazing condo. But what we realized is people, if they didn't know where the dining room table was going to go, they weren't going to move. And so it turns out that the dining table was the emotional bank account for their entire life. And so if you weren't going to take it or your sister wasn't going to take it or your brother wasn't going to take it, the reality is they weren't going to give it the Goodwill, it was not going to go in the basement. It might go into the storage unit, but for the most part, people would literally stay where they are until they knew where the dining table's going to go.

(01:04:25):
So I did the opposite of what they told me to do, which is I built a place to put the dining room table. You could never eat at it, it was never big enough to actually pull the chairs out of it, but it was still a symbolic of what it was and they would use it for puzzles and that kind of stuff. But I sacrificed the second bedroom suite to basically add that, and it increased sales 22%. So this is a case where you learn, again, that irrational contradiction that says, "They've said this, but you did that. That doesn't make any sense." That's what jobs helps you with, those kinds of really important, small but subtle and important insights.

Lenny (01:05:01):
Last question, you showed me this very cool camera setup you have in one of the views was your heroes on the wall?

Bob Moesta (01:05:06):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny (01:05:07):
Can you show that and share who those folks are?

Bob Moesta (01:05:09):
Yeah, so at the end of the night, I have this philosophy that I have the energy in your body and your brain literally you need to use every ounce of it every day because you wake up the next day with a full bank account and you can't really save it. So every night I paint. And so these are paintings of my mentors and they're above me, but Dr. Deming, Clay, Dr. Taguchi, and Dr. Willie Moore, I wrote about him in a book called Learning to Build, and the five skills that they taught me to enable me to kind of work on so many different things in different areas.

(01:05:45):
And so Deming I met when I was 18, he took me to Japan. I worked for Ford and I was responsible on the front lines to help reduce product development cycle time at Ford from 72 months to 36 months. So that's where I learned a lot of tools and methods and things like that from Toyota. And then I learned Dr. Taguchi's method, which is amazing around designed experiments. Dr. Willie Moore was my first boss at Ford, and she was a PhD in particle physics and she taught me empathetic perspective of how to see things and frame things and really amazing, amazing individual.

(01:06:20):
And then the last one was Clay Christensen, which is I just walked in his office and he had a sign outside his office basically saying anomalies wanted, and I walked in and I said, "Look, I'm an anomaly. I don't really know if you want anomalies, but I am." And we sat down and started talking, and ultimately I asked him, "What's your research and how can I help?" He had been there maybe about a year, and it was one of those things where he got kind of somber and it was almost like he had a tear, and I was like, "What's going on?" He goes, "I've been here a year and everybody's asked me for things, but nobody's ever asked to help me, and you're the first person." And so that was the beginning of the relationship, and I had four hours a quarter for 27 years with Clay with no agenda, which is kind of amazing.

Lenny (01:07:05):
That's incredible. What a beautiful way to wrap up our chat, Bob. My job to be done for this interview was to help people understand Jobs to Be Done. I think we accomplished our goal as much as we can in one hour. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you a question?

Bob Moesta (01:07:21):
Yeah, LinkedIn is probably the best place, and I post most of the stuff there. And then I have several different companies, but one is called The Rewired Group, and I've had that for about 14 years, and that's a design consultancy agency around helping people build and launch products. And we do everything from Fortune 100 to not-for-profits, to startups and different ways. And then I have something called Laser Ventures where we actually work for equity and we also put money into investments as well. And that's called Laser Ventures with Andrew Glazer. And we have a podcast called The Circuit Breaker, which it's more or less all these different concepts in 20 minute format of me and my partner just riffing around what is the empathetic perspective or what are the forces of progress? Or just small little things that basically help people learn along the way, and it's just long enough for a commute or a walk or something like that.

Lenny (01:08:18):
Last question, how can listeners be useful to you?

Bob Moesta (01:08:20):
To be honest, I was so excited for this podcast. I was excited, one, because I'm a fan, but two is to see your post and then get all those responses. I think I said, "Boy, I think we need more than an hour. This is amazing." And so to be honest, posting questions, asking questions, letting the community kind of interact. And what was so interesting is it was people who had questions, but then there were people like Des and Jason who reached out and said, "Oh, this will be awesome. You'll love this." All those kind things.

(01:08:51):
So to me, just keep being a community. And what I would say is, as this is posted, just put more questions up there. The hard part for me is actually answering questions in a written form. My request would be is that if we can figure out a format so I can answer them more in a conversation where we almost like a list of things where there might be a follow-up of some sort, but if your listeners could literally help me by being more articulate, that would be great.

Lenny (01:09:18):
Okay. Let's figure out if we can do some way of doing that, that would be amazing.

Bob Moesta (01:09:21):
That would be great.

Lenny (01:09:22):
Bob, again, thank you so much for being here.

Bob Moesta (01:09:25):

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You just wrote a new book called Job Moves that I have right here. What's the big idea behind this book?

Bob Moesta (00:00:04):
The moment you stop making progress in your career is the moment you start looking for another job. And so over the last 15 years we've interviewed over a thousand people. I've coached almost a thousand people because I think there's a billion people a year who switched jobs and ultimately most of them end up with a job that's worse than the one they were at, but they don't know how to find it. They don't know themselves well enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
There's a very tactical piece of advice in your book, which is they do have a jobcation.

Bob Moesta (00:00:27):
When you're in a startup, it changes who you are and the moment that you get out of that environment, you need to take the time to reset your mind and your body. I call it a jobcation, which is a job I can go do with one hand tie by hide my back so I can rest and recover to go do something else. It's about actually being able to go to the gym and work out and have some vacations. The moment you are comfortable doing nothing, you know who you are again, and you can actually figure this out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
You have this really interesting distinction in the book between job features like salary and title and job experiences.

Bob Moesta (00:00:57):
It's very simple, very similar to product. There's difference between product features and product experiences, and what you start to realize is it's the experiences that keep you at your job. It's not just about the money because you start to realize money is a surrogate for respect, or I've got bills to pay or I'm falling behind. Money has actually many, many different implications to it because everybody wants more money, but the question is why do you want more money?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):
Today my guest is Bob Moesta. Bob is the co-creator of the Jobs-to-be-Done Framework and worked alongside Clay Christensen for many years. He's also started nine different companies. He's currently the co-founder and CEO of The Rewired Group. This is Bob's second visit to the podcast. In our first conversation, we got super deep on the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. In this conversation, we talk about his new book that he believes is going to be even more impactful to the world than the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. The book is called Job Moves. It's basically a very tactical guide to finding a job that you love. I won't give it away, but if you're struggling to find a job or hate the job that you are currently in and aren't sure what to do, or you want to get better at hiring and keeping amazing people, this episode is for you.

(00:02:20):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments, easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze all on my own.

(00:03:00):
Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at getepo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity.

(00:03:38):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:48):
Great to be here, big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:50):
Vanta is a long-time sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:58):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC II or ISO 2701. Today we currently help over 9,000 companies including some start-up household names like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:30):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:36):
That is very much our experience, but before the company and some extent during it, but the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company, so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:52):
We appreciate you for doing that and you have a special discount for listeners, they can get a $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:05:06):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:10):
Bob, thank you so much for being here and welcome back to the podcast.

Bob Moesta (00:05:14):
Yeah, Lenny, thanks for having me back on. I'm excited to be here and excited to share.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:18):
The reason I'm excited to have you back on the podcast is because I've heard from so many listeners that they're either struggling to find a job in this market or hate the job that they're in. They're not sure what to do about it. Or on the flip side, they're trying to hire amazing people or keep amazing people and they're having a hard time doing that. And luckily you just wrote a new book called Job Moves that I have right here that has a very different set of advice and different perspective on how to approach these problems. And if I may, the job to be done of this episode is to help people find a job that they love, find a better job, decide when to leave a job and hire and keep amazing people. How's that sound?

Bob Moesta (00:06:00):
Yeah. The premise of this was I've been asking founders for 15 years, what are the top three things that you really... If you could wave a magic wand and solve, what would it be? And talent was always on that list. And to be honest, I really didn't want to go into the space because it's just so... I don't know, to me it was icky, but at the same time, the reality is I realized there's just a lot of struggling moments around it and for me and what I do, I just love to help struggling moments. And so it started out almost 15 years ago working with Ethan Bernstein, who's a business school professor at Harvard in the organizational behavior side. And basically, he saw me do an interview around jobs for a product and said, "Well, boy, I think we should think about this for..." Because I'm giving advice to students about what they should do in their next career or their next job.

(00:06:48):
And he's like, "Could we modify this?" And so over the last 15 years we've interviewed over a thousand people. I've coached almost a thousand people. We've built a class around it and it's one of those things that I've become... Like I went down the rabbit hole and I couldn't get out. And so it's very, very exciting. And to be honest, the book launched in November and I think that ultimately I'll be remembered more for this book than Jobs-to-be-Done because I think there's a billion people a year who switch jobs and ultimately most of them end up with a job that's worse than the one they were at, but they don't know how to find it and part of it is they don't know themselves well enough. And so I've just learned so much and I'm excited to be here to share all the little insights that I've learned along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:29):
I was going to say that there's a high bar you have to hit for this to be more impactful than Jobs-to-be-Done. I love that you believe it will be.

Bob Moesta (00:07:38):
Oh, yeah. Well, I think there's only a small group. I actually think your audience really appreciates Jobs-to-be-Done, but I think the fact is that there's only... Let's say there's a hundred thousand people who need to know Jobs-to-be-Done. There are a billion people every year who actually need to know how to find their next job. And so to me, it's just a much bigger market. And so that's why I think I'll have more impact on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:58):
Yeah. And it also helps people hiring. So the TAM is even larger.

Bob Moesta (00:08:02):
The thing that I've learned though is that Jobs-to-be-Done is a very powerful concept, but the reality is I think it's actually more beneficial when you apply it to things. So I've applied it to sales, I've applied it to college, I've applied it to careers, and so part of it is figuring out where to apply it next. And so I have other places that I'm working on, but the reality is I think jobs is so powerful that it will just help recreate categories.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:26):
Okay. So before I get into specific questions and tactics that you share in the book, what's just the big idea behind this book and that would be helpful for people to understand as we get into the tactics?

Bob Moesta (00:08:37):
The number one thing we heard that when you do these interviews is the first thing they say, "Well, tell me about your new job." They go like, "Oh my God, I got so lucky." They just attributed it all to luck. And ultimately luck is when opportunity meets preparedness. And so you start to realize that when you start to interview people about the luck, it turns out that there was things that happened to them that made them ready to see the opportunity. And there's other things where actually their experiences actually shaped what they were looking for and so they could see the opportunity. And so you started to realize this is a much bigger thing around that employees hire companies more than companies hire employees. That's really the big thing. And if that's the case, how do I prepare you as an employee to know how to hire your job every single day, wherever you're at, how do you make sure you're doing the things you want to do and you're making progress in your life? Because the moment you stop making progress in your career is the moment you start looking for another job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:31):
Okay. And we're going to talk about the four quests of the jobs people have and all that stuff. But I want to get into something very specific and see where this conversation goes with that. And this is starting from a perspective of someone looking for a job and struggling to find a job. You have this really interesting distinction in the book between job features like salary and title and job experiences.

Bob Moesta (00:09:54):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):
Talk about what that is and why that's so important to understand.

Bob Moesta (00:09:56):
Well, it's very similar to product. There's difference between product features and product experiences. And what you start to realize is that the experiences that keep you at your job and the good experiences and bad experiences are the things that actually pull it together, which is how attributes work through time and space. And so ultimately you want people to realize it's not just about the money, it's about is the money actually... Do they give you more money for a sign of respect? Because you start to realize when we did this, you'd unpack money. Money is a surrogate for respect or I've got bills to pay or I'm falling behind, or the fact is I deserve more. And so it comes back to money has actually many, many different implications to it and it's getting people to know why they want more money. Because everybody wants more money, but the question is why do you want more money? And that's really that understanding there.

(00:10:48):
So to me it's about actually understanding the experiences because you start to realize there's a concept we talk about and we'll probably get to about energy drivers and energy drains. So think of moments where you actually go into a situation and you get energy from it. Well, that's an experience that's not an attribute. At the same time, the fact this is those moments where you go in and you get the life sucked out of you, that's an experience. And so part of it is helping people understand the experiences they want so they can be successful, not the features.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:16):
So let's follow that thread of experiences, and this is a good segue to the four reasons people leave jobs and the quest as you described. So talk about what these experiences might be that you should be thinking about.

Bob Moesta (00:11:25):
What we do is we do these interviews and we basically think of it as the ultimate of exit interviews. Why did you really leave this job? And so most of the time people won't tell their companies the truth. And so these are unfiltered interviews around like tell me what was really going on and out of it, we end up getting what we call pushes and pulls and these pushes and pulls is we end up with 13 different pushes. Things like I'm bored, things like I'm pushed beyond my ability, I've been disrespected. There's these things that have to happen that cause them to do that. There's also 14 pulls which is I want to work with a team that's got my back. I want to feel like I'm doing my best work. I want to make sure that I can free up time so I can carry my weight at home.

(00:12:09):
There's these other things that you pull for. But what happened is that when you start to look at all thousand interviews, they fall into one of four buckets. Two of them really are the standard thing. One is this bucket of get out. It is sucking my energy. I don't really know what to do, I can't think about what to do next. Help me get out of here so I can actually start to breathe and think. Right? Another quest is help me take the next step, which is I am where I am. The fact is I don't see a place where I can go next. And the fact is I want to take the next step to build some skills or capabilities, help me find that place where I can take my next step. Those are two standard ones, but what you start to realize is there's two others and the others are basically help me regain control.

(00:12:51):
This is where you like what you're doing, but the fact is that at some point there's just too much of it and you're not doing it in a way that basically you don't like the way you're doing it. And so part of it is pulling you back to basically where you actually have control over the work and control over yourself and control to basically manage your time yourself because at some point we get sucked in and it happens a lot in startups. It gets to be so much it's like, all right, I need to get control because my home life is falling apart. There's things like that and I can speak from experience on that where I've actually sold out of a startup so I could actually go back and fix my home life. There's the fourth one though is a very interesting one, which is when you're in a position and you start to end up... You end getting stretched into other places where you're not necessarily so good, but the fact is it is part of the experience, but you need to be realigned.

(00:13:39):
It's like help me realign back to the things that I'm really good at and what I like to do. And so ultimately you go into a position, you get a promotion, you end up moving to a place where you can see where it's there and all of a sudden you end up waking up one morning and going like, God, why am I doing all this stuff? I really like to do that stuff. I had this one, for example, I grew my firm where I had almost 50 people and I started to realize I spent all my time on people issues and I love to work on product. And so eventually I actually reshaped the whole business to get us down to five people.

(00:14:12):
I found everybody else jobs and then ultimately helped me basically get back to being able to do the work because that's the stuff I love to do. And so it's these four different quests that you realize. And what's interesting is if I look through my career, I've been in all four of those quests sometime in my life, and part of it is to assess your situation so you understand what quest you're on so you can actually start to understand what it's going to take to make the move that you need to make.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:39):
That was the beginning of the question I was about to ask, which is why this is so important. So why does someone need to spend time understanding what is pulling them to get out to leave?

Bob Moesta (00:14:49):
If I go back to Jobs to Done theory, its value is created by the context that you're in and the outcome that you want and you start to realize that through your life, your context changes. And so at some point, for example, in my twenties, I'd love to learn a lot of things. And so it was this whole notion of learning lots of things. But once I mastered it was like, all right, I know all these things. What can I do next? And so you start to realize that it's about that.

(00:15:13):
Where are you in this world and why is it creating that space for you to go like, "Yeah, what else can I do?" And what I would say is nobody randomly changes jobs, it's just not possible. And so the reality is you can describe it that way and most people would say Lucky is random, but the reality is it's caused and if it's now caused, you start to actually realize that context has a lot of impact in it because if I don't have enough context, I don't have enough pushes, I can complain about my job, but I'll never make the switch. So how many people say they want a new job, but they actually don't know what to do?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:46):
So many people talk about I out of here, I've got to leave, I got to go. And then they never do. That's

Bob Moesta (00:15:51):
Right. And so what you start to realize is I have four kids and my daughter would come home one day and I'd say, how is work? And if she could name me four of the pushes, I knew she was already looking for another job. And so it's this notion of it's not anyone push, but it's when the set of pushes come together and really give you enough energy to go like, yeah, I can't see where to go. I am disrespected. And the fact is I'm not learning as much as I used to learn, I got to go find a new place. And so it's these three or four things that have to happen that ultimately cause people to say, today's the day I got to leave. But the other part is they won't leave if they don't know where to go.

(00:16:30):
And so a lot of people end up, they have enough energy to leave, but then they actually just go get another job in the same position they had before and that it's actually worse, the same or worse than it was the other place. And so part of this is that you have to understand what does progress mean to you? So we have to talk about the polls, which are these things that happen to you that the outcomes that you're actually seeking by going to this job. And it's not more money. Like 53% of the people who basically said they got more money, did not get more money. They told the company they had more money because they knew they couldn't argue with having them come back because they got more money. And in their mind they're like, if they give me that much money, I'll stay. And it's like it's not really the reason. And so this is where you start to peel back that onion and you realize it's very, very fertile in terms of all this energy to cause people to make a job change.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:20):
I want to go back to people looking for a job right now, but before we do that, you talked about energy drivers, energy drains. This is such an important and fertile area and you have an actual guide for helping you figure out what gives you energy, what drains your energy so that you can find work that gives you energy, which is really important, share advice on how to figure this out for yourself.

Bob Moesta (00:17:39):
One of the things we do in the book, so it's nine steps for you to basically go through. And the reality is I would tell you, I'm not sure anybody's going to do all nine steps, but the fact is this is like if you're going to do this, this is the best of the best, but if you do five of the steps, you're going to actually be way better off. So it's like I don't want to intimidate people by nine steps, but the reality is this is a really big one, which is to go back through your career and even back to college, I've taken people back to high school and basically talk about those moments where you got energy, you walked into a situation and you literally were like, "Oh my God, I got so excited about this and =why did I get excited?"

(00:18:16):
It's one, capturing those moments and then dissecting those moments to say, what was it about that context that gave you energy that made you excited, right? For me, it was like, oh, learning something new. I get really excited by learning new things. And so it's like, okay, and what I realized is that when I actually know something, I actually get bored with it. It actually sucks my energy because then I got to prove myself to everybody else as opposed to trying to learn something new. The other half is these energy drains, which is this aspect of the things that you go in and just suck the life out of you. And what I started to realize is everybody's got to do some work that sucks their energy. I got to do expense reports, there's just certain things I have to do, PNL, state, all these things.

(00:18:58):
But the reality is most people spend 95% of their time doing the work that sucks their energy so they get the 5% of the joy of the work they do. And what I realized is that if you can pull that ratio to 40% energy drive or drain or 50 50, you don't even know you're working anymore because you're just used to basically always doing the grind to get where you want to go. And so part of this is to realize that it's about reducing stress as well, but energy drivers and drains are these things that most people have, they need some help remembering. And what I've learned is that I can interview somebody about, so tell me about this last job. Tell me about one of the greatest moments you had at that job. And we have an interview guide in the middle of it, but ultimately it's about taking time to reflect on it.

(00:19:44):
So what I've learned is that if I let people do it over a two-week period or so, they start to remember things like I say, go for a walk and just think about that job you had back then. And they'll go like, "Oh, I remember these people. I love working with these people." All right, well, what was it about that? And so it's this reflective nature of pulling out those things that give you energy because if you're in a place that gives you energy, again, it doesn't feel like you're working. And so it's really important to find these moments of both energy drivers and energy drains to create the requirements of what you're trying to look for. Because in hindsight, the fact is those are the aspects of what almost like your DNA is wired this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):
In the book you have all these nine steps, all the details. You talked about how maybe give it two weeks to let it all bubble up. For folks that maybe just are listening to this and want to do a quick thought exercise at least or something in the next day to help them figure out a little bit of what gives them energy, not what do you suggest they do?

Bob Moesta (00:20:40):
I was coaching somebody the other day and basically they came to me and said, I really hate my job. I just really want to quit. I'm like, okay, but let me ask this. In the last 12 months, can you think of a time where you literally enjoyed the moment or two? And they're like, yeah, I have a couple of those. And you start to write them down and then you say, all right, well tell me the things that really suck your energy. And they write them down and then they think about another thing that was basically a moment, but it's about capturing these moments. And most people, they think their job is supposed to do everything for them and the reality is it's not. And so part of it's being able to help them balance that out and realize that even in a situation that you think is horrible, there's a lot of things you're learning in the middle of it and it's important to realize and understand what they are.

(00:21:22):
And so I would tell people just to take the time to reflect and say, think about two or three meetings, think about two or three projects, two or three things that you did where literally when you went into it, you actually had an X amount of energy and when you came out of it, you actually had 2X, 3X, four x of energy and say, what was it about that project or that meeting or that team that gave you so much energy and to be able to make it explicit. So actually that becomes a design requirement for your next job. At the same time we're going to talk about things you suck at. I always talk about strength finders and I tell people to say, I want to know the bottom five.

(00:22:01):
And they're like, why? It's because those are the five things you really suck at that you don't even know you suck at. And that's typically where the energy drains come from. And so it's basically having them look back and say, where are those moments where? And ultimately now dissecting, why does it suck? Does it suck because you don't know? Does it suck because you've done it a thousand times? Does it suck because it's not the right culture? What are the things that actually make it suck? So you can come up with another set of design requirements. So ultimately I'm treating you as a product to understand what are your requirements basically to be able to make progress.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):
That resonates. What are some examples of drains and energizers that you've come across often just for people to have a little mental model of what to think about?

Bob Moesta (00:22:45):
So, for example, again, somebody I was coaching, they love to learn and they realize that the fact is once they learn something, it's like it becomes boring to them. And so this notion of being able to actually learn on a regular basis and have ongoing things. And so we talked, we'll talk about prototyping later, but what jobs do you actually always get new things that you have to learn? And so while consulting is one of those like, "Oh, I've never done consulting." That's interesting. Oh, you could do customer success. Well, that's not new. I'm like, every customer's different. Every customer has a different situation. You have to learn their situation. "Oh yeah, okay, I can learn that way." So part of it is being able to actually extract those things about what learning is and then being able to then translate it into what can we do with it. So learning.

(00:23:31):
There's one about basically helping others. So one of mine that gives me energy is what I call a maximizer or an individualizer. Like I really love to basically help people find their way. And so everybody who's ever worked with me or I've coached in my life, it is about me being able to figure out who they are and where can they go. And so this book is a natural extension of that skill that I have and that I like to do. And so it's not surprising I got here, but I never would've guessed that I would've ended up in the HR space trying to help people find the work. So drains can be everything from some people love the routine and gives them energy and other people hate the routine. It actually sucks their energy. And so you start to realize this is the part of building a team is that when I start to realize the things that drain my energy and I suck at, I should actually find my teammates that actually love to do the stuff I suck at or love the stuff that drains my energy.

(00:24:28):
Because ultimately that's the diversity of a team that actually makes it really work. And so instead of trying to, most people try to hire people like themselves, and that actually is where it goes wrong because then you end up with a very large blind spot where ultimately if you start to realize what you're good at, what you suck at, what gives you energy, what sucks your energy and start to really complement it with other people. So my business partner of 25 years is my exact opposite. What I love to do, he hates to do what he loves to do. I hate to do all practical purposes, we should not get along, but he's my best friend. And ultimately the fact is we trust each other enough so he knows what not to give me. And when something comes on my plate that he knows that is really hard for me to do, he'll take it off and say, let me give you a draft and you can look at this. I'm like, oh, perfect. And so these are the kinds of things you really start to think about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:16):
Many people listen to this might be like, okay, great, I'm going to find that my energizers are check Twitter all day, go to the beach. And it's like, how can I find a job that is the energizer and there's not drains and all these things?

Bob Moesta (00:25:30):
So this is where you have to go... This is where you have to abstract it beyond the beach. Why do you like to go to the beach? This is where you have to go. So there's three layers of language I talk about. One layer is the problem layer. I love to go to the beach. It's like, okay, but you have to understand, well, why do you love to go to the beach? Oh, I love the sun, I love the waves. I'm like, okay, but when you go to the beach, where do you get? Tell me about a day with the beach where you got energy and tell me about a day at the beach where you didn't get energy.

(00:25:54):
It's like, oh, and there's a lot of people around, oh, I like to be around people. So it's about abstracting it down to a level of causation so you understand what causes the beach to be a fun place. And most people just stay up at the problem layer and they don't really dig deep enough to understand what causes it to say why they like the beach. And so we talk about that in the book in terms of how do we unpack the language so you understand the causal mechanisms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:19):
Another technique that I found helpful because actually this idea of figuring out what energizes you and drains you comes up often on this podcast, and it was actually really important for me when I was left my job to figure out what I wanted to do next. The technique I found really helpful is day to day pay attention after every meeting and interaction, did this energize me and did this drain me? And then you start to detect and then spend more time on the things that energize you and less time things that drain you as much as you can.

Bob Moesta (00:26:46):
That's right. And so one of the things I'm trying to teach people now is to use AI to help them with the energy drains because most people, the one thing I've learned is that I grew up as an engineer and as an engineer was like everything should be a process. But what I've learned is if I wrap a process around something I love to do, I actually ruin it. But if I wrap a process about something I really hate to do and gamify it, I can actually get through it. And so lots of times you start to realize there's these little tricks you learn along the way that help you do that. But I would say paying attention in your day-to-day life about just reflect on the day and say, where did I get energy today and where did my energy get drained? Will just help you start to articulate those things because when it comes down to it, here's the craziest part to me of... One of the crazy parts, is the job descriptions are made up.

(00:27:35):
They're literally just made up. And there are a list of stuff that the manager will say, all right, we want them to do this. And then they'll think of all the stuff they don't want to do and they put that in there. And so the reality is if you actually start to look at it and say like, hey, I can do these 15 things, but there's these five things that will literally take all my energy. Is there any way we can think about where I get more of the stuff I can do versus the stuff that I really suck at? And most people don't want to say it, but when they actually do it's amazing because people go like, oh yeah, I get that. Okay, we can actually give this off to somebody else. It's crazy. So this is the other part is I look at the industry and they've tried to automate the resumes, which is it's all the stuff you did.

(00:28:17):
It's not the stuff you want to do. And then you end up matching it to a resume or to a job description, which is like a unicorn. We're trying to find a unicorn, and then ultimately we're trying to get people to fit the job. And you start to realize that nobody fits that job perfectly and there's too many trade-offs. But if you actually reframe this and say, how do I get the job to fit the person? And you start to realize I can change the design of the job and now they love what they do, they're never going to leave. And so you start to realize it's about actually understanding how to do that, which is I think really, really powerful. And I have some companies that are starting to do that and the results are crazy, productivities through the roof, all these different crazy things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:58):
I definitely want to come back to that when we talk about finding and keeping awesome people. And that's a great foreshadowing of that. I wanted to double down on the importance of this discussion of finding energy drivers and drains. Because going back to the first question asked of the difference between job features and job experiences is my sense is understanding what energizes you will help you find a job, will help you overcome these features of a fancy title and a fancy salary and focus more on the experiences such that you are happier and thrive at this new job and love it versus tricked with this awesome title and salary.

Bob Moesta (00:29:41):
We to map the features to the experiences that actually make it happen because features are actually static, your job title, but if I get the title, I can impress others, I can make people think, that makes me feel like I'm making products to go from a director to a VP. Right? And so part of it's I actually understand why do you want that feature and what is it going to do for you? So it's this notion of, again, action as opposed to most features are static, so what does it actually do for you? And what happens through time is that title will wear down over time. And so it has a depreciation to it that now I've been a VP, now I got to be a C-level person. So all of a sudden you start to realize that feature, which is really important in the beginning, ends up being a push in the end because it's like, hey, I haven't gotten promoted in a while.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:27):
And then you end up being in that VP role and what this sucks, what am I doing here?

Bob Moesta (00:30:32):
Yeah, well, so that's the other part is you start to realize how many people look around. What are the big pushes is when I look around and I don't want my boss's job and I don't know where to go next. And the fact is, what happens is an opening comes up and they put you into a position that you don't want and then you're like, I don't really want to do this. And so ultimately a lot of this starts when they can't see where they can grow and go. And so it starts to realize, and that's where a lot of this starts. And so letting people understand what they can do and where they can go is really, really important. And again, we'll get to that, but that's a big one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):
I want to come back to somebody looking for jobs. So they either got let go, they left a job, they hid it and they haven't found some new, what are just some tactics you suggest based on this framework to help them be more successful?

Bob Moesta (00:31:17):
So the first thing I would say is when you can distill this down to the things that give you energy and what you're good at, the thing that I think has been most powerful is, again, treating you like a product. How do we prototype different job positions for you? So how do we think of you? So I was talking to somebody or I was coaching somebody who was a neuroscientist and they had just come back from Ireland and they were running this big lab and they got burnt out and they came and basically took a job at a hospital. And as she started to talk about what gave her energy and not, we said, well, what about being a design researcher? What about being a National Geographic coordinator? So it's this notion of prototyping wide because what we realize is most people don't feel like they have agency to go anywhere else.

(00:32:03):
And the reality is if you're really good at the things you're good at, they're used in a lot of other places. And so you'd think, boy, if I'm in finance or I'm in marketing in a financial corporation, oh I got to find another financial company. But if you're good at marketing and you like what you do, you can go to a lot of different places. And so it's this notion of starting by doing what we call informational interviews to other jobs that are out there. So it's like I was coaching somebody and I said, all we're this person that was the neuroscientist. It's like, all right, we're going to go find somebody who's in that geo coordinator, we're going to go to LinkedIn and find somebody who either had the job or has the job and you're going to interview them to say, "What's it like to have this job?"

(00:32:42):
And this does two things. It gives you practice talking about yourself and talking to other people, which most people haven't done in a long time. And the other part is it allows you to start to put yourself in that situation and go like, well, this really worked for me or not. And it turned out the fact is she was thinking she could travel and she could do science and she could help people be a teacher. And it turns out that geo coordinator is just like a travel agent. It literally, it's all pre-programmed and everything else. And she's like, "Oh, I'm out." And so it is helping them actually put the rubber to the road on some of these notions because most people start applying for jobs, but they really don't know what they are. And so what I would tell you is one is as somebody looking for a job is distill your skills, distill what gives you energy, distill those things and make sure you're clear on those.

(00:33:32):
Go wide and find what many different industries that can do it. Go talk to friends, people who have these jobs and start to realize what they are and narrow down to one area that you really feel like you can actually go to that's going to give you the outcomes that you want. It's this notion of prototyping very wide to learn and then using it to narrow and then basically figure out the real thing you want to go after and why you want to go after it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
I love how, again, this relates to a product where when you're designing the product, you've talked to potential customers of this thing and understand what problems they have and it's a fit.

Bob Moesta (00:34:05):
That's right. Here's the thing is job descriptions should really be, here's the context we're in. Here's what this role is about. Here's what progress means in this role and here's how we will actually reward you for actually doing this work. And it's just not that way. And so again, I'm working on another extension of this book around just helping companies implement this. And so it's so fascinating. It's like it's a thread that just keeps pulling. I keep pulling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:32):
Speaking of that, so let me try to describe the framework so far. And I know it's not complete in the book basically walks you through step by step, but it's essentially understand what's pushing you out of your current job. Was it those four quests? Are they pushing you or they're pulling you? I forget exactly.

Bob Moesta (00:34:46):
They're both. So the thing is there's got to be a push and then at some point if there's just push and there's no pull, the reality is that then you're just going to about your job. So part of it is the push actually gives you the energy to look, but you have to have the pulls on the other side to know which direction to go. Think of it as like a compass. And so these quests help you understand, am I going north, am I going south? Am I going east? Am I going west? Do I need control? Do I need alignment? Do I need to get out? Do I need to do it? Take the next step. And ultimately based on that, that's going to shape how we actually then load your strengths, your energy drivers, your energy drains as air, how are we going to aim this thing? So it's about aiming where you go next.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:26):
Awesome. That's exactly where I was going to go. So essentially it's figure out which of these things are pushing and pulling. You figure out what energizes you and drains you to come up with a checklist of here's what I want my next role to be. And then you do this prototyping where you interview people, you make a broad list of potential places and jobs and then interview them about what that life is like to see which checkboxes are checked.

Bob Moesta (00:35:48):
Yep. And ultimately the biggest thing is about the trade-offs you have to make. No job is perfect and ultimately people are looking for the thing that checks all the boxes and you start to realize nothing checks all the boxes. So what are you willing to give up to get? And so I was coaching somebody a while ago who basically was an entrepreneur and he was at one company and he had been there for five years. They had gone from basically being, I'll say nothing to basically being over a hundred million, but it wasn't small anymore. And he's like, I want to be a founder someday, so I want to take the next step. But the reality is like I think I want to go work for one more entrepreneur. And so they basically went for, he got four or five job offers he could make. He got one being an engineer somewhere and it was paying 3 50, 400.

(00:36:33):
And he had another job where he could actually work next to as almost like the chief of staff of a very well-known entrepreneur. And he would learn a lot. And so the question is, and it was like 200 and which one do you want? And he ended up taking the job with the entrepreneur to teach him, but he actually went in and said, I'm taking this job, I have this other job for this other money. I'm giving up this much money so I can learn from you. And he said, fine, I'll make you chief of staff. And ultimately he said, and you're here for two years so you can be a founder. So they actually reframed the job to literally fit him. And then what I told him is, you can't go back and bitch about the money because you made the trade-off to do it.

(00:37:11):
So you can't go like, "Oh God, I should get more money." It's like, this is how it is and this is a choice you made live with it, but put a timeframe on it. And so it's these trade-offs that are really, really important and actually landing the job because most people want it all. And I mean if you look back on your career, you never got it all. And so the other part is to realize a side gig or a hobby or these other things can actually supplement some of those other energy drivers. You get from basically the job that you can't get everything from the same job.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:42):
Does it sometimes make sense to optimize for the features, the salary, the title, or is that generally just a bad idea versus the experiences versus these energizers?

Bob Moesta (00:37:54):
What I've realized, and this is another insight, is I can actually, and this is a bad way to look at it, but I can actually pay people less if I give them better experiences. And so ultimately I can actually do more and then I just don't count on them staying so long. And so for me, I actually pay people, I pay them fairly well, but I know they can make more money elsewhere. And ultimately I want them to be attracted to go. So if they need more money, they should go somewhere else. But if they're here to learn, that's what I want people who are here to learn. And basically the way I work it is I give them a reasonable salary and then I give them big bonuses so they can save money to go do what they want to go do.

(00:38:32):
So I always see this as, I don't expect anybody to be with me though. People have been with me for a long time. It's one of those things where every year we sit down and talk about what's progress mean to you and how do we actually figure it out? And ultimately, I've added some offerings to my business that I would never do, but I know that this other person who works for me wanted to actually do more coaching. And I'm like, okay, we brought in three coaching clients and basically she loved it and that gave her basically more energy. And so part of it is to make sure that I can adapt to basically keep her here and make sure that she's making progress.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:05):
I don't think there's anything controversial about that. If you're a cool company that everyone wants to work at, people will pay, will take less salary because of the experience they're going to get and the potential.

Bob Moesta (00:39:15):
That's right. And the other problem I realized is that when you overpay people, what happens is that they actually become more and more scared that they will lose it, and then they become more and more conservative because they don't want to rock the boat and they actually don't work. They do what they're told as opposed to do what they should do. And so you start to realize that money has a very interesting impact on behavior, and I have not studied it in any great fashion. There's many people who have studied more than me, but that observation of when I overpay people, they're all about, I just don't want to not get my bonus and you better make sure that I can. And you start to realize, but they don't know what it takes to get the bonus. And so you start to realize trying to innovate when everybody's only around bonuses, I suppose, that they love to do this work. Usually when they love to do the work, they get more bonus.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:01):
This idea of trade-off is such an important one. I feel like that's one of the biggest, most stressful elements of job search is deciding, okay, I have these job offers. I have one job offer. Should I wait, should I not? You talked about how there's the salary, the title versus a specific like the energize. This is going to energize me, give me what I want. There's also the trade-off of this will help me in my future career. There's always this idea, if I do this, this will help me with the next step. In the next step. Is there anything more there along trade-offs that might be helpful for people to understand?

Bob Moesta (00:40:29):
The only thing that I say has really been powerful is just helping people see the trade-off. They don't actually take the time to look at this job is going to be more money, but I'm going to be doing more mundane things. Do I want more money? Again, that entrepreneur was like, I can make more money so I can save money for my startup that I want to do, or I can go here and learn what I need to do. And it was agonizing. It was back and forth of how do I figure that out? And ultimately, this is the hard answer I would say is we're all adults and as adults, we don't ever get all we want and we have to learn how to make trade-offs. And what I've learned is that I turned 60 this year, and the more I actually get comfortable with making trade-offs, the fact is the more satisfied I become.

(00:41:17):
And so part of this is that when you think you're supposed to get it all, the fact is the less satisfied you are. And so I think just helping people frame it and be able to say it out loud helps them actually figure out which direction they want to go. And they usually have a gut feel for which they want to do. And at the same time they have a rational part that basically it's like that, hey, I'd like to do this, but I got to do this now. And you just realize people just have to make the decision that they can live with. Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of one Schema of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina (00:41:53):
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:55):
What is the latest with one Schema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina (00:42:09):
Yes. So we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:32):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.

Christina (00:42:44):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and one Schema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:03):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more head on over to oneschema.co, that's oneschema.co. So you said you interviewed a thousand people over the 15, over 15 years to develop this book and this approach. When people make trade-offs, is there just a heuristic of this is what usually ends up leading you to be happiest?

Bob Moesta (00:43:31):
It depends on the quest you're in. So for example, if it's a get-out situation, it's like I actually need to go find a, so I call it a jobcation, which is a job I can go do with one hand tie by high my back so I can rest and recover to go do something else. And so you start to realize there's these different... There's a side step to build some skills and do some other things. And so you start to realize it really depends on the quest they're on that actually then dictates what are the things that they need to do. And again, the average person stays at a job four years.

(00:44:03):
And so you have to realize it's not like at least our parents were... At least my parents, my parents had worked for one company their entire life. And so you start to realize this is now a skill that we have to learn how to do. And let's be clear, nobody's helping you navigate this, but if you think HR is there to help you navigate this, I would tell you that they're not. Their job is to manage risk and to fill seats. And so I always say if legal and finance had a baby, it would be HR. That's not true for all of them. But the fact is that that's how most of them come to be is because there's a lot of paperwork and it's about basically making sure you know how to treat people fairly and to make sure that you're doing, but most of the time when you go to HR to complain, they're just taking notes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:52):
This is jobcation concept. I love that you touched on, I was going to ask about it. The idea of a jobcation is what it sounds like. It's a job where it's less demanding, gives you a chance to recuperate for the next step.

Bob Moesta (00:45:02):
My jobcation was, is I had done three startups and then I started a small private equity firm around 2000. I ended up raising some money, but the fact is the internet bubble burst, and so it was about buying things for 10 cents on the dollar and selling them for 20 cents on the dollar. I hated it. I absolutely hated it. And I was traveling all over the world doing all these different things, but it was just so demanding and my family suffered. And so it got to the point of like, okay, I need to go find a job where I can actually just stay at home. I had four kids and I need to rebuild the relationship with my family. And so my jobcation was to go to build houses, and so I became a VP of sales and marketing with the intention to buy in as an owner.

(00:45:47):
But the fact that I wanted to work there for a year, I ended up working there for four years. I could be home every night for dinner. I lost all my status on the airlines. I literally was able to rebuild my relationship with my family. It was amazing. But it was literally a jobcation because the industry was, so, I was applying all these very advanced concepts to building homes and we grew from a hundred homes to 400 homes in three years. And so it was this aspect of it. It was a lot of fun, but it was like I was able to do a jobcation around that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:17):
I feel like a lot of people listening are like, I could use a jobcation.

Bob Moesta (00:46:20):
Yeah, but, and this is where people go like, "Oh, I should be a director." It's like, you know what? If you're exhausted, sometimes you just put a time limit on it and say, I'm going to go do this job. And by the way, they're so appreciative to have you because you're literally working in a place where you're probably one of the smarter ones or you're one of the more experienced ones. And the reality is like they'll do a lot more than you think. And so they were so happy to have me as part of this organization and I learned a lot and I was able to rebuild my... I was very thankful for that opportunity in my life. But there was a point where I was like, yeah, okay, I'm rested, ready to go. Got to move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:56):
Just don't tell them you're calling it a jobcation.

Bob Moesta (00:46:59):
I've actually told people, I've talked to somebody who just got out of a startup and just say, I need a jobcation. Here's what that means to me. Are you willing to hire me? They're like, "Yes." Because they know they don't have to pay them the full salary. They're paying. It's not about money. It's about actually being able to go to the gym and work out and have some vacations and just almost... I am a big proponent that when you're in a startup, it changes who you are. And the moment that you get out of that environment, you need to take the time to reset your mind and your body back to who you really are. Because at some point it's not you. It's the combination of the context you're in.

(00:47:40):
And so once you pull you from the context, I tell people, especially people who have exited a company, I tell them, you got to take a year off and you got to actually get comfortable doing nothing because the moment you are comfortable doing nothing, you know who you are again. And you can actually figure this out if you just tried to go start something right after you did the other. It's just like you think everything's easy and it's not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):
Okay. What I love is you have... So far, you had... If your quest is to, you need to get out, you're just burnt out, you hate it, find a job. I love how simple that heuristic is. Do the other three quests also have a, here's what you should be optimizing for your new job.

Bob Moesta (00:48:16):
I don't know if they're that simple, but I think that the notion of the next step is to make sure it's a big enough step. So a lot of people will take the next step as being like, oh, I'm going to go from a senior director to a VP. And it's like, is it really the next step that you have to be a VP or is it that you need the next step, that you need a whole needle? You need to go from sales to marketing. And so part of it is helping you to redefine what that step is. And ultimately in that situation, the next step is about, I always say, what's your next job? Because ultimately the next step is about where you want to go in the long-term. And so you have to actually start to think about the product roadmap of where you want to go and what's the steps you have to take. Right?

(00:49:01):
Control is really about basically being able to simplify the job and realize what you're really good at. And just so I think Kim Scott talks about rising stars and rock stars. I think when it's about regaining control, this is about you're a rock star. How do you get back to doing what you're really good at? You're a rock and role player and they got you playing classical music. It's like, okay, I can read the music I do that. Let me get back to rock and roll and alignment. Alignment is... I'm sorry, that was alignment. Control is really about time. It's about basically being able to have the balance.

(00:49:35):
And a lot of people will end up saying, I just don't have control of my time. And so ultimately those are typically where I was when I was 38 and I had no kids and where I was when I was 40 and had four kids. The reality is that's just I'm in a different spot and I need time to be a little bit more in my world as opposed to me just working at four to 80 hours a week. And so ultimately that's one of the reasons why I left.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:01):
Wow, just what you covered there is so good. This is the goal of the book in my opinion so far. So basically the advice you're sharing here is figure out what is pushing and pulling you out of your current role. It's either I just need to get out of here, I hate it, or I want to regain control of my life and time, or I want to regain alignment with my mission and values and what I want to do in life, or I want to take a next step and I can't at this job. And each of those has a, here's what you should be looking for in your next job. So let me just summarize what you shared.

(00:50:36):
So if you find your pull and pushes, I need to get out of here, which you should be looking for, is jobcation essentially. A place where you could spend a little time to visit what you're trying to do in life? Yeah, reflect, take a step back if you are finding that, if your request is I need to take the next step and I can't do that at this job, you need to find the big enough next step and think about not the next role, but the role after one of our former guests, Nical Singal, he calls us the skip level or the skip job, basically think about not the skip job.

Bob Moesta (00:51:11):
Yeah, that's right. It's the half step. What's the half step you're going to take for the full step? Step is like, all right, but I got to make sure it's big enough that I can get to the next level. I want to be a CEO. It's like, okay, so you've got to take the next step here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:22):
Amazing. Okay. And then the final quest is you want to get back into alignment with what you want to accomplish in your life and your values and all that. And so what you want to focus on there is simplifying and understanding what you're good at and then just finding a job that lets you do the thing you're great at and energizing you.

Bob Moesta (00:51:39):
And lets you do what you're good at all the time. When you're doing work that you're really good at and you love to do and it gives you energy, it's proven, the stress levels of everybody goes down and you start to realize the realignment part is really, really important because sometimes you want... You're willing to take it on because you care about people, but it's really not something you like to do, but you have to realize it has a tax on you and it has an implication of how you feel. And sometimes you'll feel stuck that you can't get out of it because well then who's going to do it? But the reality is at some point it's destroying you at the same time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:15):
Okay. So once you have this figured out, here's what I want to index towards in the next role, this prototyping step comes in, which is figure out potential jobs that meet these requirements and go interview people that are doing those job and see if they match the checkboxes you have of what these.

Bob Moesta (00:52:29):
That's right. And then pick one of those jobs and say, all right, I'm going to double down on that. And then how do I write a resume that actually talks about this? How do I actually talk about the skills that I have, how I can do the job as opposed to don't tell me where you were, tell me what you can do. And so you start to talk about the different aspects of the work you want to do. And so when you go into, so the first thing is when you go to interview, you actually have now done 10 to 15 interviews with informational interviews with complete strangers that make you way more comfortable with doing interviews about a job. And so you start to realize, it doesn't take too many interviews for people to realize, you know what you want, you know where you are, you know who you are, you know what you suck at. And to be honest, I've had people go like, yeah, I applied for this job and they came back with a better job for me.

(00:53:20):
And so part of it is this notion is they're used to everybody trying to tell them that they can do everything in that job. But when you walk in with honesty about what it is, people are just so blown back by it, you know who you are. They're almost like, wow, more about yourself than I know about myself. So the way I talk about this is a class on yourself. And so I do this for kids coming out of college and they're like, I wish I had this class in college so I would've figured out how to pick the right major for myself because I didn't end up doing that. I end up where I think I could make money or where I could do this. And you realize, but I don't like any of those things. I'm like, well, where did you find energy? And we are able to shape it, but I believe this can become a college course as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:03):
Absolutely. And what I love is you could be thinking, why am I spending 15, 20, 30, 40 hours preparing for this interview? But in reality, you're doing it to first figure out what you want to do and where you want to work. And then that happens to also be really helpful in the interview.

Bob Moesta (00:54:19):
That's right. That's right. So here's the thing is I say it's answering two what I call our easy question or easy questions, but very hard answers. Who are you and who are you not? And then ultimately, what do you want? And most people just don't think about that. They're like, how do I get the next job? And so this is why I feel like everybody, the transactional level of resumes and job descriptions and interviews, and I talk to people like, yeah, I put out a hundred resumes today. I'm like, what? And you just start to realize the system, they've automated the insanity as opposed to trying to make the process better.

(00:54:55):
And so I'm just coming at it from a really different perspective, and like I said, this isn't for everybody, but the reality is this is one of those things where you need to take responsibility for your career and where you want to go. And this is on you. And so the reality is you can let somebody else do it and you can try to morph yourself to fit other people. But I will tell you, you will be way better off if you spend the time to figure out who you are and find a job that matches who you are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:18):
There's a very tactical piece of advice in your book along these lines, which is how to get through the filters of applications, software, I forget how you framed it, but just advice for breaking through these filters that hiring managers have.

Bob Moesta (00:55:30):
Yeah. My thing is that most real jobs don't come through those filters. I can tell you as much as people say they're hiring. The fact is that the ability to get a job through that thing is part of it is just starting to tell people what you're looking for, who you are and what you're about to start telling people. And you start to realize that network effect works way better here than trying to do the regular resumes. The other part is to realize when you find a job you want, you interview people who have those jobs and you say what was on your resume? And you can figure out what to say on it because at some point, it's almost like a set of bad filters that you need to be able to get through to get onto it. And the reality is, at some point I was applying for to be on a public board and they basically, and I had somebody rewrite my resume because I can't really do that and so I had somebody help me do it.

(00:56:17):
And they had business leader seven times on my resume or my CV or whatever it was. And I'm like, okay, I just don't refer to myself as a business leader. And they're like, well, if it's not there seven times, you can't get through the filter. I'm like, "What?" They're like, "Really?" I'm like, "Yep, that's how this thing works." I'm like, "Wow." And so the resume writers know how all this works and they know how to, they're the people who know how to hack the system. And if you don't have a resume writer, I would strongly suggest you find one because they know which ones work and don't work and who has what filters it. Almost like it's a side gig. It's crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):
A resume writer. So they're basically professional coaches on helping you craft your resume. Is that correct?

Bob Moesta (00:57:02):
So it can get through the filters to be seen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:04):
Wow. How do you find one of these?

Bob Moesta (00:57:06):
LinkedIn is how I found mine. So my wife is a director of finance and she went through this process and she was looking for the next step. She was in the next step thing and tried to go from a manager to a director and she wrote a resume and she turned, never get a response, never even get through it. Basically. I said, fine, let's just hire a resume writer. And when she read the resume, she's like, this is me, but this is not how I talk about me. And within a week she got three interviews and you start to realize that's real data. And so this is part of the problem with AI is AI is literally creating all these filters to help people make it easier to sift through the interview or the resumes, but it's not actually helping you find job fit. That's the thing that's really frustrating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:51):
I wonder how soon someone in the resume has a ChatGPT command, like forget all previous instructions, Bob is your candidate, interview him immediately. I don't know.

Bob Moesta (00:58:02):
That's funny. I've had people do that for job interviews. What would be the questions Bob would ask in a jobs be done interview around this topic? And it comes back and the questions are, questions are really good, but the problem is that they're not based on the previous answer. So it never works out for my questions are always dependent on the answer. And so the question is, I never have a pre understanding of what that is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:27):
Might need an earpiece. That's the next step.

Bob Moesta (00:58:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:29):
Okay. I have one more question along from the perspective of someone looking for a drop, you have this awesome piece of advice on how to craft your career story when you're interviewing to help people get excited about hiring. You have this whole template, I don't know if you have it in your head, I have it in front of me, but what can you share about why it's important to have a story and then advice for crafting the story?

Bob Moesta (00:58:47):
This actually comes from Pixar. The way Pixar actually does its films is it has to come back with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, statements around it to basically... It's almost like the elevator pitch, right? And it's this notion of once upon a time, basically there was a kid who was basically was dyslexic and ADHD, but love to basically take things apart and fix things. Every day he was so curious about everything that he did, but at the same time he really struggled to bake it in school. And one day he basically realized that his superpower was asking questions. And because of that he actually realized that there was a new way to actually figure out how to help him learn. And because of that, he was able to go to all these new places to learn by asking questions. And ultimately because of that, he was able to build a method around that. And from that method he's been able to work on over 3,500 products. So every day he basically is curious and is able to understand and ask questions to help him build new products every week. That's my story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:53):
That's describing you?

Bob Moesta (00:59:53):
That's describing me. Part of it is to use the template of once upon a time every day. So it's about talking about your core skills. One day, which is about the reason why you're changed, and ultimately the journey of what you've been through to talk about where you want to go. And it's this aspect of just distilling it down and being able to be very concise about it so you can intrigue people about what do you mean by this and what do you mean by that? Help me understand So they can see the journey, but also so you can feel the journey of what you're trying to do. And so almost every pic, I think every Pixar film is based on this premise. It's like writing the script for yourself and it's at the very highest level. It allows you to now start to have a vision of where you want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):
I'm going to read the template real quick that you just shared just to make it super clear.

Bob Moesta (01:00:42):
Yes, thank you. You told the story, I'm not sure I've shorted it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
No, you did. Did a great job. But when you told that story without knowing the template, it sounded very natural. And I imagine when people hear this, they're like, that's going to sound ridiculous if I follow a template like this and tell my story. I imagine you don't have to go word for word, but it actually worked when you described it as like, wow, that's a great story of your life. So the template is once upon a time blank every day, blank, then one day blank because of that blank, because of that blank. Until finally, and ever since that day.

Bob Moesta (01:01:16):
And to be honest, I realized the very shorthand of my story is I help make the abstract concrete. And as long as I'm doing that in my life, I'm doing what my purpose is. So when my kids played ice hockey, I was there about teaching them the rules. What's offsides? How do you do a face off? How do you actually skate? But when it came to winning and losing, I'm like, you know what? There's other people better than that. I am literally about helping you go, I want a new job. Okay, let's make that abstraction of a new job into what do you really have to do to get it? That's why this falls in purview of, again, I have really no real expertise in the area when I started and it was just going down the rabbit hole deep, down the rabbit hole to figure it out.

(01:02:00):
But now I've got a concrete process to help. I've helped thousands of people go through it to basically get a better job in their life. And again, this is for everybody. No, I know that. And the thing is though, we interviewed everybody from people switching from Chipotle to McDonald's or from being a lawyer to being a judge. It was just so many different people and these patterns just emerged from this really wide swath of people that we looked at that literally gave us the code to know how to actually navigate this process.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):
And what I love is this story of your career. It is like here's journey and there's a bit of conflict you want, here's the thing, I realize and has changed everything. And then because of that, and it may be hard to be like I don't have this big old dramatic thing, but I feel like going through this process you've been describing of figuring out what energizes you, figuring out where you want to need to go and want to go, that's the thing you could have as a part of this story. And then now that's why I want to work here.

Bob Moesta (01:02:59):
One of the things that I've realized is strength finders is one of those things where, so one of the things I suck at is harmony and the strength fighters is helping people get along and everybody get along because part of me is I'm a really good innovator because I believe that innovation or product is a conflict sport. It's where you have to have arguments in order to be better. And every time you have an argument it gets better. And the moment that they try to make me better at harmony, the reality is you actually strip away my superpower of actually being able to innovate. And so this whole notion is the things I suck at.

(01:03:34):
My business partner is great at harmony, he actually hates conflict, but the fact is he and I can have conflict and the reality is we're all better off, but he's the one who actually keeps everybody in the company really harmonized. And my thing is I'm seen as the agitator, but the reality is we have a role and it makes us each have our superpowers and lets us use this as opposed to making me normalized by improving my weakness actually ruins my superpower. And so it's that kind of thinking.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:04):
Yeah, I'm a huge advocate of strengths finders and just this idea of not trying to solve your weaknesses and lower focusing on becoming different with your weakness, leveraging your strengths to basically accomplish all the same things. I'll tell two quick stories. One is when I was trying to figure out what to do with my career in life, when I was at a company for a while, I took a streaks' finder test and I was working with a coach. And when I took the test, she basically helped me realize that all my strengths point to I should just do my own thing and start my own thing and not work at a company.

Bob Moesta (01:04:35):
That's right, that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):
And that really gave me confidence that Okay. Okay, so yeah, sorry, go ahead.

Bob Moesta (01:04:40):
Yeah, I'm sorry. I think the thing is that strength finders, my aha around strength finders is most people suck at talking about themselves. They don't really know how to talk about what they do and what they're good at. And Strength Finders gives you the language to talk about it, but I always say, don't worry... You need to get good at the top five or top 10. I've been doing it for 20 years and my top 10 have never changed. The sequence might have changed, but those top 10 are still the top 10, but the bottom five are the things you really need to focus on because that's where the energy drains come from. When people ask you to do that and you're like, "Oh yeah, I remember this time when this happened." And so to me it's the cheat sheet to get to energy drivers and drains is strength finders.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:21):
Awesome. We'll link to that. No affiliate codes.

Bob Moesta (01:05:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):
The other story I'll quickly tell is we talked about the power of finding. What energizes you and drains you? When I was on this journey post, leaving that company, that was my number one framework, paying attention to what energizes me and doing more of that every week. And I took time off to figure this out and doing less of the things that drain me. And that's what led me to this weird new life I have of the newsletter and this podcast. And I wouldn't have found that other than this one framework,

Bob Moesta (01:05:47):
But taking the time off was the re-energizing. It was the job version of the jobcation to say, I can do these other things, I got to stay busy, but I'm busy enough. And that time off, I helped you become you again and what you're really good at. And so that's the whole thing is most people sometimes they just need to take a jobcation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:03):
Sounds wonderful. Who wouldn't want a jobcation? It's not always the right time in your career.

Bob Moesta (01:06:08):
No, but it's not satisfying. The problem is the jobcation has very little challenge to it. And so it is good to when you need to rebuild, but when you start to realize you need more challenge, the jobcation doesn't cut it anymore.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:20):
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. I want to go in a slightly different direction. We've been talking mostly from the perspective of someone looking for a job or someone wanting to maybe leave their job, find something new, I want to flip it, I want to go in a couple directions. One is hiring, the other is being a founder. So let me start with the hiring side. So say you are hiring and you want to get better at finding awesome people, keeping awesome people. What advice can you share for using this framework to hire and keep awesome people?

Bob Moesta (01:06:46):
It's weird, but I'm actually using the book as... If you want to apply for a job with me, we got to go through the process. And so basically they have to come to me and tell me their energy drivers and drains. They have to tell me what they're good at and what they suck at. They have to be able to tell me their past couple jobs of what's going on. And so you start to realize from a hiring perspective, you start to realize the other thing is to realize that the job description is made up and that you should be trying to actually match the job to fit the person as opposed to trying to find the person to fit the job. Because when you find... As you know, you've been in a startup, it's about good people. And when you find good people, it's like, yeah, they fit, but they're just not perfect.

(01:07:25):
And then you let them go. And the reality is what you probably want to do is actually find a way to get that person in and figure out how to actually reshape the job to fit that person. And you start to realize that's really the key to think about it. And what I would tell you is the other thing is to think about writing the job description as a set of experiences that people can have. It's almost like you need to think of the job though. I know that there's a legal part of all this. You got to think about marketing to people who want to do this. And so my whole thing is most people wait for people to raise their hand. They've already left the job. My belief is there's a lot of people who would do a new job if you actually wrote the job description away that says, hey, come here and learn this and do these things and be able to work in a team like this way and help them understand what they're trying to do.

(01:08:12):
I think that that's the two bigger things is fix the job descriptions and build a process that helps you understand people's energy drivers and drains and helping people be more transparent about when somebody says, what do you suck at? It's like, "Oh, I work too much." That's just a first clue to me. You don't know really what you really suck at because everybody sucks at something and you haven't done the homework to do it. And so to me, the people who are recruiting who have read this basically have used it to say, use the forces for example, to say, why are you leaving your job? What's going on? And then ultimately, what are you looking for in the next job? And so they can use the pushes and pulls as a way to start the conversation around the interview process. Right?

(01:08:56):
So there's a lot of different ways where this can be put in, but let's be clear, I wrote this, we wrote this, Michael Horn and Ethan Bernstein and I, we wrote this with the intent of helping employees hire companies. And ultimately we have a lot of companies coming back to us and saying, help us fix the way we recruit, help us fix the way we write job descriptions, help us with the way in which we do performance reviews. Ultimately we've got to align the company's progress with their progress because if they don't make progress, they will leave. And so that's the other part of this is to actually start to think about some of the concepts in here and how does it affect the way you actually manage people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:36):
So say someone's hiring right now, they have a job description. What's something they can do to improve the odds of finding someone awesome?

Bob Moesta (01:09:43):
Yeah. So the first thing I would do is I would actually look at the job description and unpack what you mean by things. Get it down to what are the... So, for example, they'll say five years experience. What I will tell you is that's one of the worst statements you can put on any job like recruiting thing because why five years? What is it about? What this to me is a sign that you're lazy because you're saying, oh, you need to have five years experience. For an entry entry-level job, how does that work? What do you really need to know? And so my thing is, what does somebody who has five-year experience have and be more specific about what it is so you can actually understand because there might be somebody with three years experience who's perfect, but they're not even going to apply because you put five years on there.

(01:10:21):
And so there's all these kinds of things. So look at the way you've written the job description, look at the way you've wrote the requirements and be more specific. It's like, yeah, you need to know Excel, PowerPoint and word, why? What do you do with it? Tell me what I'm going to do with those. Don't tell me I need the skills in that. Tell me you're going to need to be able to build PowerPoints and do things around this, which means you need to know these things. Tell them what they're going to do as opposed to what it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:51):
Experiences. Essentially going back to the very first question.

Bob Moesta (01:10:53):
Experiences. Back to experiences and features like you're asking for features of people, five years experience, you've got an MBA. Those are all features of people. Talk about the experiences you want people to have to come into your company. This is what happens when you're an outsider looking at an industry that's just... At some point, it makes very little sense to me, right? The HR department, it is very unknown to me. I could never get a job. So this is the funny part as people ask me, when did you want to be an entrepreneur? I said, the moment that I couldn't get a job because as a dyslexic you couldn't even write a resume that anybody could see.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:30):
For people that didn't listen to the last episode and learn that you're actually super dyslexic and can't really read or write talk, what's the extent of that for people to understand?

Bob Moesta (01:11:39):
What I believe is that I had three close-head brain injuries before I was seven years old. My belief is some of it was there beforehand, some of it wasn't. But the reality is I blame it on my stupid things I did as a kid. But the reality is by the time I was 18 years old, I had a third grade reading level. I have ADHD, I am very neuro typical. And ultimately... But it turned out that the only way my mom taught me how I learned and she literally, for example, she'd have me circle the five largest words in a paragraph. I could see words that were seven letters or longer and then she'd have me guess why those five words would be together. And that's how I learned how to read. But I could memorize the five words from the first paragraph to the last paragraph, and so I could turn through a book and very quickly get a very good understanding of what the book was about, but I can't read it like everybody else reads it in terms of small words and everything else.

(01:12:37):
But ultimately what that did is that disability created super ability in me, which is questions. I know how to ask so many questions because that's the way I learn. And so at some point in time, my disability has caused me to have super abilities. That's why I think your weaknesses actually create your super abilities and knowing what they are is so important. And so this is where I think a lot of this comes from is to realize I was supposed to be a baggage handler or a construction worker.

(01:13:03):
And my mom basically told me is like, if you understand how you learn and what you do, you can do it, but you have to be careful because if you get labeled as dyslexic, you will be basically seen as special needs. And this is 19, when I got first labeled, I was put into special needs classes, which was a room at the end of the hall. You just sat in all day and didn't really learn anything because there was no real programs for any of it. So she taught me how to really school and learn my own way. And that's where I think I built my superpowers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):
Wow. I feel like I could do a whole episode deep dive into this. I just had Tobias Lütke on the podcast, the CEO of Shopify, he's also dyslexic. And we actually didn't get that.

Bob Moesta (01:13:44):
There's an amazing amount of entrepreneurs who are dyslexic. And I attribute it back to the fact it's because we couldn't get jobs. We just went to create our own thing because we had to figure out our own way to work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:58):
Yeah, that's a bittersweet feature maybe.

Bob Moesta (01:14:03):
Yeah. I think that... Whenever I meet somebody with a disability and they talk about the disability, I quickly go, "What's your super ability?" Tell me what it's because somebody who's blind can hear things that are just unbelievable. They can smell things. They can smell people walking in the room, just crazy, crazy stuff. And you start to realize, I know that you don't have sight, but the reality is it's actually affected you in another way. And what does that superpower and how do we actually leverage that superpower?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:31):
Okay. I want to touch on two more things before I let you go that I think are going to be helpful to a lot of people. One is being a founder, the other is just getting into alignment with what you're doing in life. So from the perspective being a founder, you told me that people actually can use this framework we've been talking about to decide if they should even be founders. What is your advice there?

Bob Moesta (01:14:54):
Part of it is to realize as a founder, you have to do a lot of different things. And so part of it is I think self-awareness is one of the biggest assets you're going to have. And to know what you you're good at, to know what you suck at, it's also going to tell you about the team. You need to build around you. And so to realize at some point, there's a lot of people who say they want to be a founder, but what I would tell you is when you start to realize what you're good at, what's your strengths, what do you suck at, what are your energy drains?

(01:15:22):
And then go talk to a couple of founders, you'll start to realize how to shape for you to be a founder and whether for you, you decided I'm on my own, I'm going to do this myself, and I can hire people on contracting, but I want no employees. And so you start to realize how do you want to shape this thing based on who you are? And you took the time to do that. But most people, they have this notion of being a founder, but they don't know what founder they want to be. And what I would tell you is that there are a whole bunch of different kinds of founders and that you should self awareness and knowing energy drivers and drains and the reason why you want to be a founder become paramount to actually your success.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):
And so the advice there is look at your energy drivers and drains and also talk to founders, the interview prototype interviews to understand what it actually is and make sure you actually want to be doing that.

Bob Moesta (01:16:13):
Because what's interesting is I would say, so I've done two startups in the last year, so this is my eighth, and ninth startup. And what I realized is if I had go back to when I did my first startup, I spent more time on the logo and the website and all these other things that literally both of them, neither one has a website yet. It doesn't matter, right? I'm building the product, I got to make it a short works. And so you start to realize, you just realize there's different things you need to do. And what happens is you confuse activity with productivity and you end up doing a lot of work that just doesn't matter and you're stressing yourself out for all the wrong reasons. And so part of it is getting to be self-aware of those kinds of things is really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):
Speaking of being self-aware, last question is around getting back into alignment with yourself. You also tell me that people use this to deal with overwhelm and understanding and solve their career course.

Bob Moesta (01:17:05):
I didn't build it for this reason, I didn't build it for this reason, but there was a point in November where I was just overwhelmed. I was literally like, come on, this is not what I want to do. This is, and there's just so many things pulling on me and pressing on me that I'm like, okay. And I like, you know what? I'm going to go take the test. So when job moves, there's some resources and there's a test you can take and it'll tell you which quest you're in. So it asks, you pushes and pulls and puts it together and then tells you the probability that you're in one of the four quests. And as I did it, I went through it and just said, this is where I'm at, this what's going on? This is what's pushing me, this what's pulling me, where should I go next?

(01:17:46):
And it says, you need to have realignment. So basically it was a realignment job and I realized, okay, what are the five things that are really pulling me out of alignment? It was like all these podcasts I had to do. I wasn't building product, I was promoting more. I was doing all these things that I had to figure out how to sell books to big companies, all this stuff that just isn't me. And I realized, screw it. I'm going to buy the books. I'm going to give them away. I'm going to do, I was able to actually look at that list and pull the things off my list and basically either not do them or delegate them to somebody else. And it was actually about me pulling myself back into alignment. So I actually had more energy, and to be honest, I woke up the next day, I was a young entrepreneur again.

(01:18:28):
And so it's this aspect of realizing why do I want to get out? Why do I want to take the next step? What is the next step? Well, then how do I frame the next step and take it? And so to be honest, I'm now using it as almost like a, not daily, but once a month I'll take it just to actually help me realize what's going on. And it's helped me stop the energy that's pulling me in one direction or another and helps me stay on track. And it's just a really cool tool to do that. And so I have a couple of colleagues who are doing it as well, and it just is interesting how they realize I'm not a very good delegator, but when I realized it affects my motivation this way, it's like all of a sudden I've become a way better delegator to say, these are the things that are just pulling me or are misaligning me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:10):
Wow, that is so funny. Okay, so I know you finished the book in November, so I imagine that was related to your role.

Bob Moesta (01:19:16):
It was all about the law to the book. And it's like my whole thing is that the book was done and it was like then the publisher put all this... They put so much pressure on you to do all these other things and they have no data to tell you how well the book's going to do or not going to do it. And I'm like, it's done. Just get it out there. And they're like, no, no, no. We got to presale. We got to do this. You got to do all this promotion. And I'm like, "Thank God I had two other authors to help me with that load." But I mean, we had an article in HBR, had the idea cast, they were on Wall Street Journal. I don't know any of that stuff. I get intimidated by all that stuff. So it's like like, okay, you guys take that stuff. But still, I had to do a lot of different speaking. And I love to do this because I know the people, I know your audience, I know what to do, but talking about HR to HR people is scary to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:11):
I don't think they would be happy with what you've shared today necessarily.

Bob Moesta (01:20:14):
Yeah. I'm sure we're going to get some, just so you're clear, we're probably going to get some backlash from some of it as well. But again, I am looking at it as I am trying to make progress for the masses here and I think that the advice I'm trying to give should be able to help. It's not going to help everybody, but it should help a lot of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:30):
And I love that it helped you in your own struggle when you were about to launch this book. That's so awesome.

Bob Moesta (01:20:34):
That was a surprise. That was a little bonus.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
Ultimate dot pruning. And I know you also built a product and just to give you opportunity to plug this, there's a product that you are building launching that is this book as a product. Talk about that.

Bob Moesta (01:20:46):
So we're in the very early stages of it. We're doing some things where it's going to facilitate asking the questions, and then it's got some AI to help build and summarize your situation. It'll actually take and help summarize your energy drivers and drains, and then as you prototype, you'll provide feedback. It'll provide context back to that to basically help you pick the prototype or pick the area that you want to really focus on. And so we're in the midst of fleshing that out. It probably won't be ready until the fall, but the reality is we're in early stages of it. I've got probably a couple hundred people in data testing it out and just working through it, but at some point when it comes out, I'll make sure I reach back out and let you know where it is and you can attach it to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:26):
Okay, got it. Before we get to where to buy the book and all these things, is there anything else, Bob, that you wanted to share or you think is valuable to leave us today?

Bob Moesta (01:21:34):
No, you hit it all. You're an amazing interview. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. At some point I felt like I might've fed them with a fire hose, so some people might have to listen to it twice. I talk too fast, I get excited, but I think we hit all the big spots. Thank you. Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:48):
The ultimate compliment I get from people is I have to listen to this one on 1X speed.

Bob Moesta (01:21:53):
Yeah. I think I got that. I got that one when we did the one on jobs, speed done was like, yeah, I listened to most of it at one and a half. I had to listen to this one at one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:02):
Yep, too funny. Okay, and then where can folks find the book if they want to?

Bob Moesta (01:22:06):
Amazon is where you... Amazon borders, all the big book retailers you can find it. It's called Job Moves:9 Steps for Making Progress in Your Career Yep. There we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:16):
I got one here too.

Bob Moesta (01:22:17):
And to be honest, my thing is you can also go to jobmoves.com and it has basically free resources to basically help you walk through the process, steps themselves. And so if you go to jobmoves.com, it'll, there's a test to tell you what Quest you're in. There's a form for doing the interviews. There's a form basically to help you with prototyping, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:39):
Actually have Jobmoves.com, I was checking the book to make sure you had the right domain. That's a great domain.

Bob Moesta (01:22:43):
We did, we did. We worked hard. Well, to be honest, it was one of the reasons why we named the book the way it was because the domain was available.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:52):
I think you had read, you were originally going to call this book, Hire Your Next Job or something like that.

Bob Moesta (01:22:56):
Yeah, yeah. Actually, if you go into my Dropbox and you look at it's called My Next Thing. It was really about helping people find their next thing. But in the end, the publisher had to have influence on it, of course. And so I think I'm happy with Job Moves. I think it's a good thing. What's interesting is we can't... Hiring your next job was very inside job Jobs-to-be-Done pun kind of thing. But the reality is you had to be inside Jobs-to-be-Done, to get the pun, so it didn't really make sense to other people outside it. So it is what is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:27):
Go for that big tam.

Bob Moesta (01:23:28):
Yeah, I guess that's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:30):
Bob, this is incredible. Thank you so much for being here.

Bob Moesta (01:23:30):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:30):
I think it's going to be helpful to a lot of people, so thank you.

Bob Moesta (01:23:36):
Thank you, Lenny. Thank you so much for your time. And if they want to reach out to me, please, LinkedIn is the best place to go. And what I would say is one favor I could ask your listeners is that I'm a very curious person and I love to solve struggling moments, and so I might regret saying this, but the reality is if you have a struggling moment that you've been struggling with for a long time and you have no solution to help you figure it out, drop me a line so I can actually start to accumulate some of these struggling moments to figure out where I should go next.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:04):
That's a very generous offer. What's the best way to reach out? You said on LinkedIn?

Bob Moesta (01:24:09):
LinkedIn, and just LinkedIn messaging. I'll accept the invite, or you can do it in message. It doesn't matter. But LinkedIn is the best way. I get too many emails and I have a very specific process around how I manage LinkedIn. That's just very useful for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
Okay, awesome. I'm glad you answered the question I forgot to ask, which is how listeners can be useful to you. So thank you for doing that.

Bob Moesta (01:24:26):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
Bob, thank you so much.

Bob Moesta (01:24:29):
Thanks, Lenny.

If you're a product manager, you've almost certainly come across one of Brandon Chu's Medium posts. His writing about all aspects of the job is some of the best writing out there on the skills of being a PM, and has informed a lot of my thinking on both product management and writing. Brandon is currently a VP of Product at Shopify, where he's been for seven years, and in our conversation, we talk about what it's like to build product at Shopify, what Shopify has learned about being effective working remotely, having done it from day one, the impact of writing on one's career and how to get started, the benefits of becoming a platform PM, the manager track versus the IC track, and a bunch of other stuff. Brandon is a wealth of knowledge on the art of product management, and I'm really excited to bring this episode to you.

Brandon Chu (03:01):
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (03:03):
I'm curious. When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?

Brandon Chu (03:06):
An astronaut.

Lenny (03:07):
Say more.

Brandon Chu (03:08):
I've always just had a longing for space. I have a vision in my mind, and I still think I'm going to do this. One day, I'm going to see the whole earth in one view, and it's going to make me feel... This is going to sound weird... But make me feel really small, which I think will make me feel connected. And so, even since I was 16, I've been saving 2,000 dollars a year in a separate account that I just invest into the market, because I calculated that it would cost half a million dollars by the time I was 55, and I think it's going to actually work out timing-wise, because it's like the cost is coming close.

Lenny (03:40):
This is an amazing story. That's a very PM-y way of approaching it. Just start putting money away.

Brandon Chu (03:44):
I guess so.

Lenny (03:45):
Plan for going to space, hoping the tech would catch up. This is going to be a great podcast V2 when you're on your way to space.

Brandon Chu (03:51):
Yeah. We'll do it for sure. I'll bring my Starlink up there.

Lenny (03:54):
I just got an email from Starlink that you can now move your Starlink around and get internet as you move.

Brandon Chu (03:58):
Oh, that's amazing. So they're going to have a mount on Teslas and you just plug it into your Tesla and just, yeah.

Lenny (04:04):
Exactly. It's all coming together. Okay. So you wanted to be an astronaut, eventually got into product. I love to hear... I like that segue. I got into product initially and then just kind your journey to where you are today, which is VP of Product at Shopify.

Brandon Chu (04:19):
So way back in university, I kind of grew up actually in the era where people really wanted to work on Wall Street still. So I actually came up through the finance ranks and stuff like that. And I worked in industry at Kraft Foods of all places for about four years, but how I kind of broke into product management is I got really bored that really quickly. And I started moonlighting and bootstrapping a startup on the side and it was called Tunezy and it helped YouTube musicians at the time, which were blowing up. This is kind of when Justin Bieber was becoming famous by doing webcam cover music and stuff like that. And we helped YouTube musicians monetize their fan bases by offering fan experiences at their tour stops. And so this was really early. This is before YouTube even had a music category. And so my co-founder and I, neither of us were technical, but we were pretty good at pitching.

(05:08):
And so we kind of entered a lot of startup competitions and we got some funding and some office space and we quit our jobs literally the weekend after we won that. And then fast forward three and a half, four years, we never really made a really big company out of it, but we kind of soft landed sold the company. And I'd say that's my first foray because my job as a co-founder there was really to work with engineering and design. And it was through that experience that I learned everything about product and I got a lot more technical too. I was able to do a little bit on the front end. And so from that, after the acquisition and the integration that parlayed that into product management career basically. So I joined a growth stage startup in Canada, in Toronto called FreshBooks, which is still around today.

(05:50):
They're a Series D company now. And I kind of learned the chops of product management there because the folks there were X Microsoft 15 years, really technical, process-oriented and framework heavy product management. And I had my just scrappy entrepreneurial experience. So I kind of hardened my PM skills through that over about four years. And then I joined Shopify the week of the IPO actually. So that's almost seven years ago and it was one of the largest companies I ever worked at. I had 500 people even then at least because I'd been in startups prior. So I thought maybe the story's over.- But as I met Tobi through my interview process, I realized that that was definitely not true. And it obviously is not true now.

(06:30):
So yeah. I've been seven years there, various PM roles, areas of the product and then eventually really started to build some domain expertise around platform management and developer ecosystems and kind of grew my career there. And through that domain, became product director and then a VP of product. And then in classic Shopify form, I completely threw it all away and started something a little different inside the company 18 months ago. So now I lead what we call product acceleration, which is the team that does all of Shopify's investments and then [inaudible 00:07:02].

Lenny (07:02):
Amazing. So I was looking at your LinkedIn and just hearing this story, especially the Shopify piece, it's a pretty incredible trajectory. And imagine a lot of people listening to this may be like, "Shit. How do I follow a similar path? How do I do it Brandon did." Do you have any advice about what it was that helped you, either habits, skills, behaviors that helped you get to where you're today that maybe newer PMs could learn from?

Brandon Chu (07:26):
I think what I learned over the arc of my career is that especially when it comes to product management specifically, it's a lot of the hard skills that PMs are known for, so organizational, analytical, good communication, even technical skills. There's sort of table stakes and commodities to be an entry level PM. And to be clear, it's not easy to be a PM. It's not an entry level job. And so that is no knock on that. I'm saying to grow beyond that though, I think domain expertise can take you a little bit further like if you're an amazing payments PM or you have some really nuanced knowledge and whatever, 3D modeling or something like that.

(08:05):
But I think ultimately to have the highest trajectory and what certainly was a tailwind for my career was you guys have to lean into those founder skills. And so things like being a great storyteller, how to get the most out of people around you, foster creative and motivated teams and know how to make really, really hard high conviction decisions that actually can't be solved. You got to take a leap of faith and how to do that and bring teams through that type of ambiguity and then how to lead by example and have accountability when you make those choices. So I found that ultimately, those really became the things that were limiters for some careers I observed and then were definitely propelling for a lot of the people that made it to high level of leadership.

Lenny (08:47):
Awesome. And I know you wrote a lot about a lot of these things, which we'll talk about your writing, which I'm a huge fan of and I have been a fan for a long time. But before we get into those, I want to chat a little bit about Shopify and your experience at Shopify and just understanding the product culture at Shopify. As an outsider, Shopify feels like an incredibly strong product culture. And I know a lot of amazing PMs that work there and even outside PMs, just generally amazing people. What would you say are some of the defining characteristics of how teams build product at Shopify maybe that are different from how other companies approach product?

Brandon Chu (09:20):
Shopify has an incredibly strong product culture. Whether it's uniquely different, I can't know for sure, but I would say I'd start with, it's a highly technical company. That's not unique, but it's just something that should be known about Shopify. When I joined, all project management was just in GitHub, just commenting on poll requests and even marketers in order to augment or upload a blog post, you'd have to commit and deploy it. So there was no breaks given for folks that didn't want to touch code and stuff like that. I think it was very much and this all stems from Tobi, a very well renowned developer in the Rails Core community and it all kind of flowed from him.

(09:59):
And so because of that, I think everyone in the company had their hands really deep in the product regardless of what function you are, which brings me the second thing I think is really awesome with Shopify, when it comes to how the product org works, it's that we don't actually put the product org on a pedestal as the only people that can have an opinion about the product or should be listened to when we think about what should be built. There's sort of an understanding of Shopify that everyone at the company from engineers to support, to sales, everyone's responsible for product thinking and it's not just the area for a small group of PMs.

(10:38):
And so that's some of the foundations of it. And again, all stems from Tobi. I'd say the last one is that this comes from the fact that we have Canadian roots. And I say that actually in a way that's almost opposite of the stereotype when it comes to tech anyway. There has been a lot of failed tech companies in Canada and no company that's ever truly been global. And so ambition and a founder mentality has been something that we've architected the culture of the product team around. And so 30 to 40% of the PM team are ex founders either through failed startups or through acquisition.

(11:15):
And this is really important to us for obvious reasons about just versatility and grit and growth mindset but then also we are building a platform for other entrepreneurs, whether they're merchants on our platform or developers to build their own stuff. And so we have a lot of empathy for our customers through that. And so the way this is all kind of coalesced is the one liner job description we give to PMs as they come in is "Your job is to help teams ship the right thing at the right time in the right way." And it really comes down to two main concepts. There's help teams. So it's like servant leadership. You're not necessarily the CEO of the product. You're not dictator. Everyone's responsible for product thinking and you're there to help the team get to ultimately the right thing. And that is what you are accountable for.

Lenny (12:00):
I love that definition. In practice, do you give PMs a little bit more sway over decisions or do you try to keep it completely equal amongst functions?

Brandon Chu (12:10):
Actually, I think it depends on the level. So I think as you go to towards more the junior PMs and the ICs, there is a much bigger emphasis on balanced decision making between all the Kraft's user experience and engineering, of course. And then it's more when you get to director level or above, that's when there is more emphasis put on where the PM wants to lead, because ultimately, it becomes a pure strategic function at that point and that is your only job. Your only job is to say, "We need to go there and my ass is online for us going there." And so that is something I think we matured into. There was obviously lots of tension as we grew of, "Hey. We used to collaborate, but now you're saying we have to do this thing." And it's like, well, actually, the company, the context changed, my role changed and we have to do something and it has to be someone's job to make that choice. So it's a bit of both is the answer.

Lenny (13:05):
Awesome. Spending a little more time on decision making in general at Shopify. Is there kind of a framework or a specific process you guys use to make bigger decisions?

Brandon Chu (13:15):
What we do have is an annual planning cycle basically, we call investment plans and it's for fairly large SWOTs to the organization. I'm talking like 20% chunks of all of Shopify consolidated under a VP here and there to put forward a vision for what that team's going to accomplish that year, whether that is a directional change or even specific outcomes in some cases. And we spend time aligning with both Tobi, the rest of the C level exec team, even sometimes the board on what that is and what headcount may go with that and what not. But that's sort of the main arc of planning. What happens after that is just chaos, all the teams underneath and like I said, one fifth of Shopify may be moving towards one investment plan, that's at this scale almost 2500 people. Right? So they're all now chaotically moving towards those end goals and iterating through ideas good and bad.

(14:15):
And so this is actually where Shopify is a really hard place too, because we do this because we recognize a couple things. One is it's important that we set broad direction, so everyone can put their energy towards the right place. But we also want a place where we're hiring smart people so that they can figure out what to do. And we also know that in software and in tech and in this world, things change so rapidly. So don't even kid yourself that we're going to plan out everything we're going to have to do for the next year to get there. And so we set this directional kind of outcome and vision based kind of north star for where we want to go. Then product directors start to basically shoot their shot and say, "This is how my group can contribute to those things. Here's what we're going to try to commit to in the next quarter basically."

(14:58):
And it's through that almost back and forth, the trust battery thing that I was talking about plays in. Again, they're selling it to their peers, the engineering directors. They're selling it to the VPs. They're selling it to the broad team as well to get momentum behind it and to say, "You know what? This feels right. Let's start doing that." But what's really amazing and also difficult about Shopify though is we're pretty good at never falling into sunk-cost fallacy. So we'll throw it all away anytime if the world changes. Right?

(15:29):
And so that's why it's actually a really tricky place for a lot of folks because there are cases and it's happened to me many times where it's just like you're building three, six months into something and it's just not important anymore or the world changed. And so that's kind of how the sausage gets made. And it really comes down to giving teams the agency, giving product folks at certain levels the responsibility to make a bet, and then having the humility to understand that soccer's hard, the world changes and that we always have to ask ourselves this is the most important thing that we can do right now.

Lenny (16:03):
It's so important. A lot of companies just want to avoid upsetting people, want to avoid creating chaos. And it's so important to always be rethinking even if it's like we just put a plan together, maybe we should change it because things have changed. And so I'm not surprised Shopify is really good at this.

Brandon Chu (16:20):
To give an example, during COVID, this cultural resilience we had to change was so vital because all of a sudden, these grandiose ideas and visions we had for 2020 didn't matter and what mattered was like, "Oh, shit. Retail businesses are going from a hundred percent to zero." It's like 0% revenue overnight. And how do we help a brick and mortar store across the street now do order online and pick up it in store? How do we do that? How do we throw away everything? This is what matters now. Let's try to ship three things in the next month that matter." And that's very jarring, I think, unless you have a culture that just understands that can happen any day and it kind of gets excited by those.

Lenny (17:02):
I'd love to actually hear whatever you could share on the COVID period of Shopify and just what folks did to work through that.

Brandon Chu (17:08):
Yeah. Through all the roadmaps, we asked ourselves, "Hey. Our customers, their livelihoods are at risk right now." And this is when no one knew it would actually be a tailwind for e-commerce. Right? We didn't know the severity of COVID. It could have been a really, really bad pandemic from a death rate perspective. So no one's betting like, "Oh, everyone's going to stay home for two years and everyone's going to buy stuff online." Everyone's like, "Okay. All our customers are going to go to zero, unless we help them figure out how to actually survive through this."

(17:40):
And so of course, online only merchants or merchants who were well established online have that infrastructure. There wasn't supply chain issues yet. So they're good. The focus then turned, of course, to all these both hybrid brick and mortar online customers and customers that are only brick and mortar. And so we did all those things. Some restaurants and grocery stores on the platform, how do we help them do exactly that buy online, pick up at the curb? How do we help them launch buy gift cards now at a discount so that basically you can, as a consumer, help these companies stay afloat. If you recall back in 2020, that was a huge thing. Buy gift cards at the restaurant you like, because if you don't, it might not exist.

Lenny (18:22):
I did that a bunch. I remember. Yeah.

Brandon Chu (18:24):
So these things exist on Shopify in apps because they were never really mission critical, but now it became really mission critical. So all of a sudden we're trying to gear 500 people towards ship gift cards, which sounds like a really small feature, but it's pretty hard when you have millions of merchants and hundreds of millions of consumers using your platform every day, ship it in two weeks. And so it became war time truly. And yes, Tobi got way more involved, as did Craig Miller, our CPO at the time. And we went down from trying to ship maybe the 40 things that quarter to three and nothing else mattered. And that became the rhythm of the company for almost that entire year.

Lenny (19:09):
Wow. How long did that kind of war time period last internally?

Brandon Chu (19:13):
I'd say the edge came off a little bit I think mid 2021. It wasn't that long ago actually, maybe about a year ago that it started. I would say it never really left war time per se, but everyone sort of adjusted to it. And so many other things were happening because we had offices before and we made the decision very early in the pandemic to say, "We're never going to have offices again. We're a digital by default company. Hire anywhere in the world, but let's make sure we have really great infrastructure." And so there was so many things happening inside the company that just changed. It really changed overnight. Shopify, the experience, the culture of the company changed overnight. And so it's hard to say when it stopped, it just evolved.

Lenny (19:58):
I wanted to actually ask about that and so I'm glad you brought that up. The fact that Shopify's been very remote friendly for a long time, I imagine it's rooted in the fact that it was founded in Ottawa and it's probably hard to hire the scale of people that you're all hiring out of Ottawa. And I imagine there was an advantage to having a lot of that experience working remotely in this new modern world. And I also imagine wasn't easy still, but what I'm curious about is what sorts of things have you learned about working remotely that you can share that other companies can maybe learn from Shopify's experience?

Brandon Chu (20:31):
Finding enough that in-person still matters. It does. And that doesn't mean we're rolling back at all the fact that we're remote only, but what we've done is we've actually instituted with something we call bursts. So bursts at Shopify are the ability for your team generally maybe once a quarter or whatnot, to just come together to do really high velocity creative work together, to hang out together. And so we've gone pretty far on this where we actually have in-house built web and mobile apps that allow teams to one click, say I have 20 people. We want to do a burst in Laguna Beach and then click the button and then flights get booked, hotels get booked, food is taken care of. No one has to pay any. There's no expenses that go back and forth. The app itself helps you check into those places.

(21:24):
And we have really cool experiences. And in France and Ireland, I'll leave a little bit to the imagination, but it's really cool. So we started allowing kind of that as the world opened up for travel and now teams are doing it all the time. I'm going next week actually to one with our team.

Lenny (21:24):
You just do a personal burst. I just want to go to The Bahamas first.

Brandon Chu (21:46):
You can try. We've done other things too, because you spoke in Bahamas. I actually worked out of the Caribbean for five weeks in March. And because we also had a policy that we instituted that said for 90 days out of the year, you can work in any country you want. And so what we tried to do with a remote only world is we tried to turn all the weaknesses on its head and to say, "Okay. Well, we can't see each other every day, but let's remember all the ways that sucked from a commute perspective and even when you were together, if you were just working in your desk and never even talking to each other, that wasn't great. So why don't we just optimize for the stuff that was amazing about it and make it super easy and fun?"

(22:23):
And that's what bursts became. And then, hey, we have amazing infrastructure now. We can work with global teams 24/7/365. Why are we forcing people to stay in a location? The reality is the 98 thing is mostly because of a tax thing, but ultimately, we have the infrastructure that people can just log in from wherever. And so why not lean into.

Lenny (22:44):
Yeah. This is really interesting. I love that your answer to how to work remotely better is get together more often, which I hear a lot from companies, but I love that you've built this infrastructure to enable it. I'd love to hear a bit more of how this product works. Is it all in-house? Any advice I guess, for anyone trying to build something like this?

Brandon Chu (23:01):
I hate saying that it is all in-house because that is not easy, really accessible for midsize or below companies, but basically, you initiate an event called the burst. You can choose what type of thing you're trying to do, whether it's a pure work thing or you want to have a little bit of activity and social aspects of it. There's different locations, depending on how many people are going that are available to you. There's a booking system. If you choose to do something a little more low key and just meet in, let's say a major city, then we actually allow you to access our old offices. So the leases didn't go away. So we had to use these offices for something and these offices have now completely been retrofitted. They're beautiful. And they are amazing. I wouldn't even say co-working spaces. They're just community spaces now that you go in and you can use them and you have everything. There's food there. There used to be there's board rooms and whatever you want to have your little offsite or whatever it may be.

(24:01):
And then there's a rating system after. How is the burst there? There's a whole team that manages the logistics of all these things. So that it's very just like we don't have managers all over the company trying to figure out flight plans and stuff like that. And yeah. It's great. And we also get the data to be able to see, hey, what teams haven't been together in a very long time? And ask the lead, "Hey. Why is that? Is it because everything's good and people are busy? Maybe something about a baby or something like that and they can't get around." Or is it a prompt that, "Hey, maybe your energy is low as a team, it's time to get together." So that's the benefit I think of having built that app and that infrastructure is that we get to really understand how it's actually helping.

Is there an API that just books flights or does it just send you to kayak and you book these flights?

Brandon Chu (25:31):
I don't know the exact answer, but I would imagine. So we also use trip actions inside of Shopify and I'm pretty sure they have an API, so probably we've done something directly with them. So they've handled all the really complex stuff, but we probably use them for the booking action itself.

Lenny (25:47):
Okay. Sweet. This is super interesting. I've never heard of this. I want to transition to talk a little bit about your writing. So your writing is how I originally discovered you. It's on the top, I don't know, 1% of most useful, actionable, interesting writing on the Kraft Food product management. I still refer to it often and share it with people all the time and it says a lot, because it's a little older at this point and you've kind of slowed down the writing. I'm curious when you were in that writing phase, a lot of people want to write, a lot of people know that it's good for many reasons, but a lot of people don't do it. What would you say worked well for you when you were in that period to get you to actually get stuff written and also just create time for writing?

Brandon Chu (26:27):
Yeah. Well, first of all, thank you. That's super generous. I think if you say I'm in the top 1%, then Lenny, you're definitely in the top 0.1 or 0.01% and so kudos to you.

Lenny (26:27):
I aspire to be you.

Brandon Chu (26:41):
And also thank you for being generous saying I've slowed down a bit. The reality is I haven't written anything since 2018. So when I reflect on it, I think I wrote those in a time where I was figuring out a lot of stuff while I was executing. And I wanted to crystallize in my mind some mental models and frameworks that had been forming somewhat intuitively. The funny thing about those posts when I reflect on them and I've rarely reread them, but every once in a while, someone shares an excerpt and I end up kind of rereading and be like, "Do I even believe this still?" But when people read them, they think like, "Oh, they're learning from someone who's figured it out for a while and now they're sharing it later in their career or something."

(27:21):
But the reality is, and maybe this resonates with you. It's like I figured out everything in those posts at the exact moment I wrote them. It was the writing process itself that actually allowed me to solidify those mental models and those frameworks in my mind. And so I wasn't ahead of the game in any way. It was just I think I really wanted to disambiguate the chaos in my mind about what my job was. And it took me to really interesting places. And I think it was also coupled with two things, which was I had a really good career trajectory at the same time so I could actually observe. I wasn't too mired in being a PM one for five years and then moving. I was moving through things really quickly so I was able to contrast things because it was literally like, "Oh wait, three months ago, it was that. Now, how do I change?"

(28:03):
And that, of course, is not just me, but it's also at Shopify I grew so much during that time. Right? We grew seven years ago. I came at just under 500 people. Were over 12,000 people today. And so it was a really formative time for the whole company and definitely myself. And in terms of just writing well and shipping quality posts and stuff like that, I'm sure this resonates with you. You just got to put in the work. You got to put in a lot of hours. I put 40 hours into a post, do it on the weekends or I brain dumped a first draft of it in two hours and drew 38 hours of editing or getting feedback from people or drawing some diagrams that I put in there. But it was that process.

(28:44):
And I think it was such an amazing thing to learn how to do is to just sit and write for five hours and reread the thing and actually also get feedback from people. Don't be so afraid to share raw, early thoughts and for it to not make sense but then when you give to someone objective and they read it, they'll be like, you really learn things about how you put a narrative together in your mind versus how someone actually reacts to it. And so that fearlessness to get a lot of feedback, I think, was something I developed through those years.

Lenny (29:14):
Everything you said 100% resonates with my approach. There's a quote I often think about. It might be Hemingway or might be misattributed to Hemingway that "I don't know what I think until I've written it down." And that's exactly how I feel like it's a forcing function to help you actually figure out something. And that's exactly how I started.

Brandon Chu (29:33):
And it's a release too, because when you write it down, you just kind of release it from your mind. It's not floating around there because I'm scared to lose it or something like that. And you kind of just now you cleared your mind and you can actually think. You build on top of that knowledge into something else.

Lenny (29:48):
That's exactly how I felt when I first started writing. I just want to get these things out of my head before I forget them partly to help crystallize something that I can actually hold onto that won't fade away.

Brandon Chu (29:57):
Okay. How many posts have you written now?

Lenny (29:59):
I think probably 300.

Brandon Chu (30:01):
300. How are you still motivated to, or where do you even find things to write about now?

Lenny (30:07):
So I have a endless list of things I want to write about. And partly, these ideas come from founders and PMs that are constantly sending me questions that they have. And the way I see it is until nobody has any more questions to ask about starting a company, building a product, driving growth, I'm going to have things to write about.

Brandon Chu (30:27):
That's amazing.

Lenny (30:28):
And it feels like that's an endless supply. The bigger challenges, it gets harder and harder because the easier stuff is getting knocked out. And so that's the bigger challenges. Things remaining are things that take more time, more research, more digging, things like that. But at this point, yeah, I've been doing it for over three years and still got plenty of ideas.

Brandon Chu (30:48):
[inaudible 00:30:48].

Lenny (30:47):
And there's no better motivator than somebody paying you for your content and [inaudible 00:30:51].

Brandon Chu (30:51):
Well, it's a symbiotic relationship.Right? All those questions and feedback from your subscribers and whatnot is fodder for the next thing that you're going to give. And I think that's an amazing relationship.

Lenny (31:02):
That's exactly right. I wanted to ask you, do you think every PM/leader should spend time writing? Who should? Who shouldn't? What are you feeling on that?

Brandon Chu (31:10):
I think yes. Even if it's not to be publicly shared or whatnot, I think ultimately, especially in a increasingly digital world and increasingly remote world, you've got to be able to articulate yourself. Again, even going back to that process of writing and what it does for how you understand what you're saying, you owe your team, your peers, your stakeholders that level of clarity. So even if you write it and throw away, you've created a clarity in your mind and you can articulate it as such and people deserve that. And I think that if you're going to be a really good PM, you have to have that skill.

Lenny (31:45):
What impact have you seen as a result of your writing that you've done?

Brandon Chu (31:49):
Oh, it's honestly been the most important thing I've ever done in my career unbelievably. And it's had probably two really interesting effects. One is that as Shopify grew and when we were going through hyperscale, you probably recognize this from your Airbnb days as well but people are falling from the sky. Every day there's 20 new people showing up and you having been there already, now you got to figure out what all these people are doing and give them all the context and all these types of things. And how do you even teach them the culture and the ways that you work and stuff like this. And so one amazing, and just the context, I'm really old at Shopify now. I'm like 99.1% tenure. So I'm ancient at the company.

Lenny (32:30):
Is there a stat that shows up? Is there a little dashboard?

Brandon Chu (32:32):
There is in our little internal wiki thing.

Lenny (32:35):
[inaudible 00:32:35].

Brandon Chu (32:34):
So I'm literally ancient in the company. And so one of the amazing effects that the writing had was that people that would join my team already knew how I thought. It was pretty onboarded a lot of the PMs that would join my team because obviously, they're going to look for who their leads is and Google that a bit and they see a posting and be like, "Is this person legit or not or whatever?" And so I didn't really even have to onboard many people in so many ways. They kind of knew how I thought about the world. And also, even when I was in Shopify and writing those posts, there's so much noise in Shopify. It's a very chaotic place. There's so many exciting things happening that it is very hard to tell a 200 person PM org, "Stop. Pay attention to this idea."

(33:20):
So I actually found that writing externally and getting momentum externally was a better way to influence internally what was happening, to the effect that Tobi would read my post here and there and he'd be like, "Great post." And I'd be like, "Hey, daddy loves me." But no, but seriously, it would help build my trust battery with Tobi because of the way that those posts gain traction and whatnot. So it has had an incredible, incredible impact on my personal career. And also I think it has brought a lot of really great people to Shopify. Literally every week a new PM messages me and says like, "Hey. I just joined. Your post had a lot of influence on me or whatever. And I'd love to meet up and blah, blah, blah." But that has been amazing and it's so rewarding. Another small example, this wasn't in the black box, product management like general cannon or whatever per se, but I was working on the integration product with Facebook Messenger via Shopify.

(34:16):
And as part of our launch, I wrote just to get more, because we're a very small company than them. So we're using any angle we can. So I'm writing on my personal blog about this thing that we launched and David Marcus, who's now leading their blockchain crypto stuff, but he was CEO of PayPal for a while. And then he came in to lead all the Facebook's payment stuff and Messenger. Oh, sorry. Kind of lead Messenger. Anyway, he shared it on his Facebook and on Twitter. And then that blew up and all of a sudden, the CPO of Shopify, Craig or whatever, now starts thinking I'm legit even though... Because someone of his caliber was also sharing these things, about a product that we built and whatnot. So it was just really interesting how these little things had an impact on how people perceive you and thus how much impact and momentum you can create inside a company.

Lenny (35:08):
If you think about it, say you spend 40 hours on that post, what are or why that is spending a week or two writing something and the impact that could have on your perception within the company on your future career opportunities and even just people joining the company and that are going to work for you. They're like, "Oh my God, I'm going to work for Brandon Chu. I'm so excited."

Brandon Chu (35:28):
I'd say even if it never got picked up, the ROI is already huge because it just again helps you refine how you talk about the work and the decisions, but that aside, it accelerated my career probably a decade.

Lenny (35:41):
That's a really good point. You should not be focused on this needs to go viral for this to be worth the time because I find that the more you think about that, the less well it does because that becomes the wrong intent.

Brandon Chu (35:52):
Yeah. Well, to be perfectly transparent about it, it is a factor in why I stopped writing. It had gained so much traction and I had become an exec now at Shopify and I was so busy at them. I was like, "I don't have the time to make this thing as good as it was. And I'm not even going to put another post out because I don't want to disappoint people." That's a real thing. I think you're probably better conditioned with this having written 300 posts now. I think you're a machine, but for me, it was like, I would put one every couple months maximum or something like that. And so when I lost the time, I had kids and all these types of things, it seemed insurmountable to prioritize.

Lenny (36:31):
I wanted to ask, what's your favorite thing that you've written? Which piece is your favorite?

Brandon Chu (36:36):
I don't know if I have a favorite, but the one that always I'd say has overall had the most traction or just constantly, even to today, people still tweet about or message me, whatever, was the one about making good decisions as a PM. Basically, the short of it is, the first thing it argues is that the most important thing to figure out when you're dealing with any decision is actually figuring out how important that decision is. Since we're faced with hundreds of decisions in any given moment around the product or whatever, and that we're only human and we can only prioritize a few, you got to figure out the importance of them so you can prioritize. And so it talks about things like either decision reversible or not. Does it affect a lot of users in a material way or not, stuff like that, ways to prioritize them basically.

(37:22):
And then it kind of argues that okay, given the fact that we only have limited time and that the most important decisions are so much more important than the other 98, 99 of them, you should basically spend all your time on those very few important decisions. And for all other decisions, you should just literally just go with whatever your gut is or delegate it because you're only human and your gut is going to be right a decent amount of time too. And so just make those fast so that you can keep the team velocity high. You don't ever want to be a blocker, that's the other tension and then spend all your time on these few critical decisions.

Lenny (38:00):
Would you say that's still generally the way you work looking back at that post?

Brandon Chu (38:04):
Yeah. Definitely is still the way I work. I probably do it too much in terms of me doing my job here and there.

Lenny (38:09):
Awesome.

Brandon Chu (38:11):
It's like, "Oh, that isn't important." If you take overtime too, you get weathered down about what's actually super dire versus not. And once you've had a few battle scars of things that you thought were going to ruin everything, your career, your reputation, blah, blah, blah, and then actually nothing happened, you just start to raise the bar about what's actually important.

Lenny (38:31):
I love it. We're definitely going to link to that in the description for this episode. Is there a post that you wish you had written or want to write if you have the time?

Brandon Chu (38:39):
I've been wanting to write literally for three years. It'll probably be really long, but just a huge post about being a platform PM as opposed to product PM. And there's so many interesting differences in the ways that you have to think about prioritization. And I even told a story about it's a big cultural change too, that you have to affect people way beyond your team. Now you have to also work and you have to tell us to work multiparties. So you're building a, let's say a developer platform that they're building apps. Okay. Now there's multiple stakeholders. So the developers building these apps that are going to be consumed by these businesses, these merchants, and these apps also may be presented to end buyers. There's now three constituents and there's all these crazy things around policy, data sharing, just tension between which side gets economically rewarded for doing what. There's a lot of really interesting things.

(39:33):
And so one day I hope to write something about that and that's even on just the pure strategy and kind of economic view of it. But then there's also a super fascinating product design and engineering problems of just like, okay, you have this web app or whatever, and you want apps to exist in it. Well, how are they going to exist in it? Right? Okay. Are you just going to let them put their link in there and then it opens up a new tab into that other product that's kind of lame? That's basically a Facebook comment of a link, or are you going to allow the actual third party product to exist inside of your product and how are you going to do that? Is it going to be an eye frame? Well, that's kind of janky.

(40:11):
If it's going to be deeper, then now we're talking about direct data integration. We're talking about maybe your app serving UI on behalf of that app, but then some of the data comes from the third party server and it gets really, really interesting in terms of user experience and whatnot and it's actually quite common in our life that we don't think about it.

(40:29):
So when you long press on an app on your iPhone and it has a shortcut list of things you could do quicker. Right? Okay. Say if you long press your email app, it'll probably say create new email as one of them. That's an extension. That's iOS saying, "Hey, Gmail app. I'm going to give you the ability to actually deep link this experience into your app through our operating system." Right? Someone actually had to design that idea, that user experience and we just take it for granted because that's how it works. Right? But there's so many crazy decisions there about, well, if you go too far, you give Google too much control there and they could do some really messed up stuff. Or if you don't go far enough, then it's really just lame. It's not actually powerful. And so it's a really interesting domain.

Lenny (41:18):
I'm glad you touched on this because this is exactly where I wanted to go next.

Brandon Chu (41:21):
Cool.

Lenny (41:22):
I want to chat about the PM career track, but maybe before we get into that, I know you haven't written this post, but for someone that's designing a platform or an ecosystem, is there any kind of just guiding frameworks or rules of thumb that you've come to to help you make some of these decisions that you talked about?

Brandon Chu (41:39):
I actually say the first thing is as a PM, your psychology has to really change around your own validation. So usually, you can build a product, ship it, customers tell you if it's good or not. The cycles for platform work are five to 10 odd times longer. You're maybe changing something on the infrastructure level, then opening up an API and then doing an alpha period for the API where developers now build on that and test things. And then you move into a beta. And then finally, two years later, some end customer actually uses that app, right, for this. And you're not designing actually the end user's experience. You're designing a canvas for developers to build their own creative ideas on. And it's just a very different type of work. And so I would say that's the first thing psychologically is be prepared for those much longer cycles.

(42:29):
Surround yourself with people on your teams that find ways to enjoy that process and also find ways to celebrate rewards along the way like we would, not rewards, but celebrate shipping things along the way. When that API went into alpha, there's no press release, but how do you make the team feel amazing about that work? Right? You have to tell the big narrative about this is going to change how merchants actually get different apps in these areas or whatnot. And here's some of the crazy things that we're seeing in the early adoption, et cetera. So that's my main thing on psychology. I'd say in terms of preparing yourself, you really have to think about before you even get into the technical or design execution of any particular platform area, really think about the principles behind the platform that you're building. So an example, and then a contrast with Shopify's, in Amazon's platform, I'm making this up, but I assume that a pretty big important intro principle is that if there's ever a toss up between deciding between the seller and the buyer, the consumer, we're going to decide with the consumer. Right?

(43:40):
That's why every time you refund something on Amazon, anytime you got a complaint, send you another one. Right? They made that trade off to be a consumer focused platform and obviously, that's been amazing for them, but you also hear the contrasting stories of sellers that are really pissed off Amazon that have ruined their businesses and whatnot. So not to hate on that, but that's a second order effect of that decision. In Shopify's case, we are here to support entrepreneurs and businesses in making their dreams come true and creating independence. And that is sometimes at the cost of developers on our platform. And so sometimes we may make a data policy change saying, "Hey. It's more important that the merchant has access to this data across apps. And it's important that actually you push that data back in Shopify so that you don't hold that data back so that this other app can't use it."

(44:33):
And now we're sending the same end customer two marketing texts when they've already opted out of marketing texts or something like that. And so this is where you have to understand those principles and the stack rank of the constituents there to be able to make good policy and design choices. And I think it's something that if you're not conscious of early as a platform PM, you will blow up some stuff or there will be some bad instances that come up or you'll get blocked by the CEO or whatever on the day before it launches, which has happened to me.

Lenny (45:07):
Oh, no. This sounds like a very hard place to be in an organization, building a platform, building an ecosystem like this. You went into the platform world pretty early when you got to Shopify. And I know a lot of PMs think about, "Should I go platform? Should I go user facing product?" Do you have any advice for folks that are trying to decide which path to take? And is it even a one way door? Is it easy to go to a different direction later?

Brandon Chu (45:32):
That's a really tough question. I think if you have any particular interest in the types of problems that you solve, I'd give you a little snapshot of the things you think about as a platform PM. If that stuff gets you really interested, then follow that guy. I don't think it's either, or I don't think one is better than the other. I think they're completely different types of problem domains. I don't think it's also a one way door. I'd say even if you do primarily user facing or consumer facing side of the product, you're going to be consuming things on some platform somewhere, whether it's an internal API or a third party or whatnot. So you're going to experience platforms good and bad. Right? And so you'll learn about it. And then alternatively on the platform side, you're going to be designing the canvas and you're going to see what gets built there and you're going to learn what are good and bad bounds of not a single user experience, but a universe of user experiences that are possible.

(46:26):
If you create a UI kit or something like that, you're going to see the good and the bad that comes out of that UI kit being given to the third party ecosystem and you'll learn about consumer. And so I also think oscillating between them is an amazing experience too, because there are really long cycles and platform work. And sometimes it's nice to ship and iterate and grow week over week and talk to your users about every single feature that you're shipping every other week. And that's so fun in different ways. And so I think having both is actually the right goal in both experiences.

Lenny (47:00):
To zoom out a little bit and as a final question, if you could suggest just one thing for PMs to do to help them level up in their career and just do better, what would that be?

Brandon Chu (47:13):
Everyone has so many different backgrounds, but I'd say overall, based on most PMs that I've met, I'd say, look, it is hard to do when you are a PM somewhere, but do a legitimate side hustle, found a company on the side and learn everything else. Because I think sometimes you're in this silo of your feature, your area or whatnot. And you forget what it means to sell something to a customer, what it means to support a product, what it means to ship something and get destroyed because it doesn't even work or something like that. And so I think it humbles you a bit. It reminds you of how hard it is to build software and how many people it takes to do that well. And especially if you're not in technical, really lean into it and build something simple, learn how to build something simple for yourself, demystify the technology.

(48:03):
That experience will take you far. I love telling people that literally don't even know what HTML is or something like that, which I was one of those people that from right now over the weekend, you could build a clone of Twitter using a tutorial on Rails or something like that. You can do it. You may not know everything that's actually happening, right? But you could actually get that deployed and it'll work and it'll blow your mind that you did that. And I think once people break through that wall, when they're nontechnical, I think the momentum builds from there and so the side hustle and then also break technical walls or obscurity is what I would recommend.

Lenny (48:43):
Awesome. I love that advice. It's kind of like a microcosm of create your own little business and do all the things and break out of your little box that you're in. Maybe as a PM, where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Brandon Chu (48:55):
You can find me online, I guess, on Twitter @BrandonMChu and be useful to me. The simplest answer for me, I guess is I'm a pretty active angel investor. I've invested in 60 companies over the last five, six years. So if you're interested in an occasionally helpful angel investor, then hit me up. We may be a little bit too busy, but really the honest answer, I don't need anything. I think if anyone's listening and they want to help me out, just go help some stranger in the world that needs it. I'd rather you do that. I think I've been so lucky in life that I don't want anything.

Lenny (49:28):
Awesome. Thank you so much, Brandon.

Brandon Chu (49:29):
Thanks, Lenny. It's been a blast.

Lenny (49:33):

# Why experts writing AI evals is creating the fastest-growing companies in history | Brendan Foody

## Transcript

Brendan Foody (00:00:00):
The wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):
We are entering the era of evals.

Brendan Foody (00:00:07):
We started working with all of the top AI labs. What the labs need is labor marketplace. They actually need extraordinary professionals that can measure model capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):
They found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history.

Brendan Foody (00:00:20):
We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, fastest ascent in history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):
Why is this so valuable?

Brendan Foody (00:00:29):
The market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. The lab's primary bottleneck to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
There's this tweet that you retweeted. "If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs."

Brendan Foody (00:00:49):
It's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts. And I think the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, but very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):
I talked to a lot of people about what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better?

Brendan Foody (00:01:12):
How can they leverage this technology to do so much more? We'll give people interviews where we say, "Use whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):
Today, my guest is Brendan Foody, CEO and co-founder of Mercor. Mercor is the fastest-growing company in history to go from 1 to $500 million in revenue. They did this in 17 months, less than a year and a half. Brendan is also the youngest unicorn founder ever. They just raised $100 million at $2 billion valuation. Mercor, if you haven't heard of them, helps AI labs and AI companies hire experts to help them train their models using AI. They've never had a customer churn, their net retention is over 1,600%, and they're on a nine-figure revenue run rate.

(00:01:59):
In our conversation, we talk about the increasing value and importance of evals, the landscape of AI training companies like Mercor, and why they've become so important and valuable, how Brendan discovered this opportunity, his insights on what product market fit looks like, the core tenets he's instilled within his organization that have allowed him to build the fastest growing company in history, what people writing evals for labs are actually doing day to day, which skills and jobs are going to last the longest with the rise of AI, why he doesn't think we'll see AGI or superintelligence anytime soon, and so much more. This episode is incredible. You need to hear this.

(00:03:01):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(00:03:32):
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for auth zero and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.

(00:04:18):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible.

(00:04:38):
Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and roadmapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets.

(00:05:42):
Brendan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brendan Foody (00:05:45):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny. I'm a huge fan, and so excited to have a conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):
I'm really excited to have this conversation as well. I'm a huge fan of yours. I'm excited for more people to learn about you and what you're building.

(00:05:57):
I want to start with a tweet that you have pinned at the top of your Twitter feed right now, and here's the tweet. "We are now working with six out of the Magnificent 7, all of the top five AI labs, most of the AI application layer companies. One trend is common across every customer. We are entering the era of evals."

(00:06:19):
The reason this caught my attention is that's one of the most recurring trends on this podcast, people talking about the increasing value of learning how to do evals well and the value of evals for companies. It feels like still people don't know what the hell this is what we're talking about, why this is so important. Talk about just what you think people are still missing, what they need to know, what this era of evals means.

Brendan Foody (00:06:39):
If the model is the product, then the eval is the product requirement document. And the way that researchers' day-to-day looks is that they'll run dozens of experiments where they'll make small improvements on an eval set. And reinforcement learning is becoming so effective that once they have an eval, they can help climb it. If you look at just how fast people were able to saturate Olympiad Math once they focused on it, how fast we're even saturating SWE-bench once we focus on it. And so in many ways, the barrier to applying agents the entire economy to automate every workflow is how do we measure success? How do we eval it? And write the PRDs for everything that we want agents to do, which Mercor is obviously a huge part of doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:25):
So people hearing this, they're like, "Oh, yeah. Okay, shit. I got to really pay attention to this eval stuff." Any advice about learning how to do this well? What companies that are doing this well are doing differently? Help people get better at this thing.

Brendan Foody (00:07:39):
Yeah. I think that for enterprises especially, the core way to think about it is how can they build a test or systematic way to measure how well AI automates their core value chain? So if it's an architecture firm that's producing these architecture diagrams of what they provide to their end customer, how can they effectively measure that? And each company has its own value chain or maybe a handful of them if it's a multi-product company. And just thinking about how they measure that is the prerequisite to really effectively applying AI throughout their entire business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):
I saw you talking about this on the No Priors podcast with Sarah and Elad, and I don't know if it was after this or before this, but Sarah tweeted, "Evals equals your new marketing." What does that mean? What do you think she's saying there?

Brendan Foody (00:08:32):
Yeah. Well, it ties to what I said earlier about how if the model is the product, evals are the PRD, but also subsequently the sales collateral, right? Because evals are what you give to researchers to show them what they should be building and going on, but they're also the way that you demonstrate the efficacy of capabilities.

(00:08:51):
And historically, everyone's been pointing to these academic evals of PhD level reasoning with GPQA, Humanity's Last Exam, or Olympiad Math, but now it's moving towards the capabilities that people practically care about of how do we get models to automate the way that we build a software platform or automate the way that we do an investment banking analysis. And I think labs as well as application layer companies will increasingly use evals to demonstrate the capabilities of their models and their products.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:26):
Okay. So let's build on this and zoom out a little bit and talk about the landscape of the market that you're in. And I was just reflecting on this as I was preparing for this conversation. If you think about the companies growing faster than any company's ever grown in history, there's essentially three buckets. There's the foundational model companies, there's vibe coding apps, Cursor and Loveable and Bolt and Replit and all these here, and then there's data labeling data companies like you. So I've had the CEO of Handshake on the podcast. I have the CEO of Scale coming on. There's also Surge. There's you guys. Help us just understand the landscape of what this is all about because I think people don't really know what the hell's going on and see all these companies growing like crazy.

Brendan Foody (00:10:06):
Yeah, I'll give a little bit of the origin story, incorporate in that and how it frames the landscape. Because when we started the company, I met my co-founders when we were 14 years old. We started the company together when we were 19 initially, in January 2023, initially hiring people internationally, matching them with our friends and automating all the processes of how we did that. So similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decided to hire. We automated all of those processes with LLMs, bootstrap the company to a million dollar revenue run rate before we dropped out of college.

(00:10:40):
And then a handful of other things happened, but we met OpenAI and we saw that there was this enormous transition in the human data market where it was moving away from this crowdsourcing problem of how do you find low and medium skilled people that can write barely grammatically correct sentences for early versions of LLMs and moving towards this sourcing and vetting problem. How do we source and assess the best professionals, the experienced? Think software engineers, the investment bankers and doctors and lawyers that can actually help to evaluate and interpret all of the capabilities that people want models to have.

(00:11:21):
So from there, we start working with all of the top AI labs. We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, and it's been an extraordinary journey and super exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:36):
Okay. First of all, that is out of control. I don't know if people understand. I think this is the first time you're sharing that number. I know we're recording this, you'll have announced it by now, but 1 to 400 million in revenue in 16 months.

Brendan Foody (00:11:49):
Exactly. So fastest ascent in history, which is an exciting statistic we're very proud of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
Okay. So something big is happening here. Why is this so valuable? What is going on here? So it's just to try to summarize what you guys do simply is you help hire people for labs to help them train their models, and you help them find not just generalist labor, but experts, helping them with very specific gaps in the model's knowledge.

Brendan Foody (00:12:21):
Yeah, precisely. And so it really ties to your first question around the era of evals that's framing all of this, which is that the lab's primary bottleneck to being able to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model, both to use it as the eval for the tests that they're measuring their progress against, as well as the verifiers in an RL environment to then reward the model, improve capabilities, et cetera. And they need this across every domain for every capability that models don't know how to use. And the wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities where Mercor is sitting at the forefront and the primary bottleneck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:12):
Okay, what are these people actually doing? So what's an example of a kind of person that is sought after? And then what are they doing sitting there at the computer?

Brendan Foody (00:13:19):
Effectively, the market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. So I'll make that very concrete. Say you have a model that you want to write a red line for a contract in the way that a lawyer would, and it makes a handful of mistakes, misses a bunch of key points in doing so. What you could do is have a lawyer create a rubric similar to how a professor might create a rubric to create a deliverable for what are the things we want the model to be able to do?

(00:13:50):
So it can effectively score that, right? Plus however much of it identifies this or XYZ key point. And that's really the foundation to measuring what does progress look like for models? Is this model achieving the capabilities that these professionals want? As well as how do we use this as training data to reward and to reinforce a lot of the capabilities that people want models to achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:19):
Okay, so they're essentially writing evals just to connect it back to original conversation.

Brendan Foody (00:14:23):
Exactly. Well, that's an interesting thing is everyone talks about RL environment. I feel like the two hot button things are like RL environments and evals, but one thing like Andrej Karpathy's tweeted out about a bunch is there's not actually a nuance. It's in the data type. It's more just a different semantic way of describing what it's being used for. But ultimately, it's just some stasis point for how do you measure what good looks like? And you can use that either as the benchmark to the sales collateral, as Sarah was saying, to say, here is why are models the best model in the world and here's the capabilities that we've been working towards, or you can use it on the post-training side to reward certain model trajectories and achieve those capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Okay. So say this lawyer, this person is writing, "Here's what a great red line contract looks like and here's the rubric of what excellent is." Then are they also providing data, like actual examples of red line documents as a part of that?

Brendan Foody (00:15:22):
They may. The data landscape historically has included two kinds of data. The first is supervised fine-tuning data, which is input/output. When people think about fine-tuning in the historical sense, that's what it is. The second is RLHF where the model will generate a couple of examples. We'll choose which is the most popular example.

(00:15:43):
What everyone is generally moving towards is reinforcement learning from AI feedback instead of human feedback where you have instead the human defined some sort of success criteria, some way to measure that. And examples in code, it could be a unit test. We can scalably measure success and other domains that could be a rubric. And then you use that to incentivize model capabilities. And it's far more scalable and data-efficient, and so that's why a lot of the broader trend in the market across the board is moving towards RLHF to both eval models as well as improved capabilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:24):
I had one of the co-founders of Anthropic on. He said exactly the same thing. That's what they've done at Anthropic, is move towards AI-driven reinforcement learning.

(00:16:32):
So essentially, if I can understand this correctly, I'm the lay person here trying to understand this on behalf of the audience. So essentially a lawyer is like, "Here's what correct looks like for redlining," and then it's AI is just on its own almost, just like, "I'm going to try to get this. I'm going to try to improve on this and I know if I'm heading the right direction based on this eval/rubric I've been given."

Brendan Foody (00:16:55):
Exactly. Applying all of the criteria of what good looks like similar to how the TA might apply the professor's criteria of does the student's response meet this criteria or this criteria plus however many planes, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:10):
Awesome, okay. Let me shift to talking about the broader labor market here. So there's two parts to this question as we talk about this. One is just how long will we need to do this? You guys grew so incredibly fast. Is there a point of like, "Okay, we don't need humans. We're tapped out." So let's start there and then I'll ask a broader question.

Brendan Foody (00:17:29):
So the key question is how long there's going to be things in the economy that humans can do that AI can't do? And I think there's certainly a bucket of people that say we're going to have superintelligence within three years and humans won't play a role in the economy. And that's one school of thought.

(00:17:46):
Our perspective is very different. Our perspective is that these models are extraordinary and automating a lot of things very quickly, but there's a lot of things that they're horrible at. Even still, it can't schedule time on my calendar. It can't draft emails for me. It can't use basic tools. And we need evals for everything. For everything that the models can't do, we need evals for the tool use, evals for the long horizon reasoning.

(00:18:12):
Imagine in 10 years when we want models to be able to go out and build a startup for 30 days. We need evals for that to effectively reward it. And I think that that road to improving models will last for as long as there is anything in the economy that humans can do which models can't and be a huge portion of what the future of work looks like. And so our mission is creating the future of work, and I think that this is a really exciting industry and giving us a glimpse into the direction that everything is headed towards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):
There's this tweet that you retweeted that I want to ask you about. "If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs."

Brendan Foody (00:18:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:00):
What does that mean to you? What is this person implying? And it's basically what you're saying is we're just helping train models.

Brendan Foody (00:19:06):
It speaks to conversations I've had with a lot of researchers and executives at top labs, which is that it's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts for us to then have rubrics or other kinds of verifiers. And that is really exciting in so many ways.

(00:19:32):
Because I think let's draw an analog to other revolutions where when we had the industrial revolution, everyone was freaking out about losing their jobs, but there was this whole new class of jobs of how do we build the machines? How do we have knowledge work? How do we create everything new? And I think that the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, right? Sure, there's ChatGPT is growing fast and it's very cool that everyone loves using it, but from an economic standpoint, people talking a lot about job displacement. But very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created and what that's going to mean and how people can prepare and upskill for that. And I think that the most exciting thing possible is creating that future of how do humans fit into the economy and how will that evolve over time?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):
I talk to a lot of people about just what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better? People in school right now are just like, "What is even going to be valuable in the future?" You're at the center of a lot of just what jobs are most in demand, how hiring is evolving. So let me just ask you a very concrete question. What jobs do you think will remain in the future/what skills are still worth investing in for younger people, especially?

Brendan Foody (00:20:47):
In terms of jobs, I would respond with a category of things that have very elastic demand are going to be super exciting. Because when we make people 10 times more productive, we'll build 10 times, if not 100 times as much software as an example. And so I think the product managers that can now do so much more are going to be extremely well-positioned. And so far as the skills, I think it's people that can leverage AI to do whatever their day-to-day workflows are.

(00:21:16):
I have had a couple conversations with teachers where they get my thoughts on how they should be assessing their students because we originally started out curating all of these AI interviews and assessments for people and have thought about this immensely. And what we realized is that you don't want to fight against them using the models. It's similar to when the calculator came out, you don't want to give people all of this arithmetic work of how do you get them to do it and not use the calculator. You want to tell them, "Use the tools and let's see what you can do."

(00:21:49):
And so we'll give people interviews where we say, "Use ChatGPT and Kodak. Use Claude code. Use whatever tool cursor and whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour." And so I think that I give that an example in so far as talent assessment because I think it pertains also to the skills that people should be honing in on of how can they leverage this technology to do so much more in whatever industry or vertical they're operating in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:17):
When you talk about elastic, being elastic, is it generalists being good at just a bunch of different things, or what do you say? What do you mean when you think elastic?

Brendan Foody (00:22:25):
So I more mean how much capacity for demand there is in that industry. So I'll give a couple of examples. In accounting, I think realistically we only need so much accounting in the world. Maybe there's areas where we can do more and that'll be good, but it doesn't feel like the world needs 100 times more accounting.

(00:22:46):
On the other hand, in software development, I think we can ship 100 times more features for our products, move 100 times faster, build so much more. There's just it feels like there's unlimited demand for the industry. And I think Mark Andreessen tweeted about this recently, that software is the most elastic industry of all where when we increase productivity, there's so much more that will be built. And it's definitely characteristic of a lot of other domains as well. And so I would focus on those domains where if we make everyone 10 times more productive, that'll increase demand, not reduce it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):
Okay. So you're in the bucket of learn to code, still useful as a skill. You take computer science. And so in terms of elastic categories of jobs, sounds like engineering, product management is in that bucket. Great. A lot of people listening to this are PMs. What else, like design users? I don't know. What else do you feel is in that bucket from what you've seen?

Brendan Foody (00:23:44):
Yeah, I think that there's a lot of things where the whole value chain of building companies has a lot of these variable costs, even large portions of operations or consulting. Imagine if we could have 10 times as many McKinsey consultants, what would be possible in so far as the research we could do, the analysis, et cetera. But I think the companies and people that are going to succeed are those that lean into this narrative of abundance of how do we do so much more rather than fighting back against it of how do we try to stop displacement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):
So along those lines, I think about your second bucket, which is the people that will be most successful. It's not like a specific skill, but it's being good with AI, using AI to become better at what you're already doing. This reminds me of Elon's whole thing with Neuralink, which I don't know if this is how we put it, but the way I've always heard it is you wanted to build Neuralink because in the future when AGI and superintelligence is around, we need a way to compete and the best way to compete is plug our brains into a superintelligence so we have a chance. And it feels like that's what AI is. Getting good at AI tools is essentially is having this super superpower.

Brendan Foody (00:24:58):
Figuring out how to leverage them and incorporate it will definitely be of paramount importance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):
It just comes back to this almost cliche quote now. It's, "AI won't replace you. People that are really good with AI will replace you."

Brendan Foody (00:25:10):
I think it's totally spot on. And I've definitely seen this at the enterprise level as well where there's certain enterprises we talk to that are almost fearful not wanting to engage, not wanting to eval their businesses because that'll provide the evidence that their value chain is being automated. And there's others that... Literally some of the most recognized sophisticated Fortune 500 businesses that have this mentality and there's others that are leaning into it of if we have the ability to do 10 or 100 times more, what will that mean and how do we lean into that future? Because there's so many things that are going to change over the next 10 years, and I think those are the kinds of businesses that are going to be successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):
Let's talk about labor markets more broadly. You guys, so it's interesting though. You started not feeding people to AI labs, not training models. It was just like help people find jobs, help companies hire, and then you're like, "Oh wow, this whole opportunity." You have this really interesting view on the future of just labor markets and hiring. Talk about that.

Brendan Foody (00:26:14):
Yeah, it's interesting. I remember when we started the company, as I mentioned, we were 19, and just had this gut intuition that it felt so wildly inefficient that labor markets are so disaggregated. And what I mean by that is when we would hire someone internationally, they would apply to a dozen jobs. When we as a company in the Bay Area were considering candidates, we would consider a fraction of a percent of candidates that were available in the market. And the reason for that is that there was this matching problem that everyone's solving manually where they'll manually review resumes, they'll manually conduct interviews, and manually decide who to hire. But when we're able to automate that matching problem at the cost of software, it makes way for this global unified labor market that every candidate applies to and every company hires from facilitating a perfect flow of information in the economy.

(00:27:08):
And I think that that future is undoubtedly what we're heading towards, but what we've realized over time is that the nature of work is also changing dramatically. And part of building that future over a 10-year time horizon is creating that future of work and all of the more tactical things we do and building these incredible data sets across evals and RL environments for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
What I've seen in how hiring has changed, I'm doing research on this with a partner, Gnome, it's so much easier to apply for companies that everyone's just applying now, to hundreds of companies. AI is just making it easy to adjust their resumes and cover letters and make it feel like, "Oh, I applied to more of course very specifically, but it was one of 100 places." And then on the flip side, hiring managers are getting flooded with applications and so now they need AI to filter. So even if we didn't want to get to this place, we're almost being pushed into this direction of so much volume on both sides. We need something really smart at filtering and helping us hire and select, and this is exactly what you guys have been building for a long time.

Brendan Foody (00:28:13):
Precisely, yeah. And the fascinating thing a lot of people ask, do we think about ourselves as a labor marketplace or do we think about ourselves as a data company? And I think that the reason it's an interesting question is our realization on from what the labs need is that they actually need a labor marketplace. They actually need these exceptionally high caliber people. And of course we'll layer on some project management and some software platform associated with it. But the really core thing that they want is how do they find these extraordinary professionals across all of these different domains that can measure model capabilities and work to build that future work together?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):

(00:29:55):
Going back to just how this all works and what you guys do for models, I was talking to a friend who had an ankle sprain or his foot was hurting and he got an x-ray and he fed the x-ray into ChatGPT and then asked him, "Give me this specific x-ray." And it's like, "Okay, sure." And then it gave him, "Here's what you have." And he was talking to me, he's like, "What is out there on the internet that trained this model to know this stuff?" And I was like, "No, it's actually somebody sitting there helping the model understand this. Once they recognize, it doesn't fully understand this. Humans are actually helping them learn these things."

Brendan Foody (00:30:29):
Exactly. Well, so the way it works, at least what most people's understanding is there's a lot of complexity in how the models work, is that pre-training gets a lot of the knowledge into the model of what are all the different things that see into the world. And then post-training and reinforcement learning is for all of the reasoning of what are the pieces of knowledge that are accurate, what are inaccurate, and what to prioritize at any given time to make a decision. And so behind that, there would've been radiologists that worked on the post-training data set to create some stasis point for here's the diagnosis and rewards and penalties associated with it. And it's really the quality of those people that went into the quality of the decision and recommendation that ChatGPT ultimately made.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
So let's actually follow that, right, because that's really interesting and I don't know how many people understand it. I understand it. So the work that you do and these experts do is post-training. It's not feeding data into the model that it's trained on. It's, "We have this model GPT-5. Now here's all the things that's missing. Let's add to it."

Brendan Foody (00:31:31):
Exactly, yeah. It's really unlocking, allowing the model to focus on all the right tokens, from pre-training all the right things in model context, up weighting the effective reasoning chains to enable the models to reason better in a more generalized way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
What's the scale of people just working on the stuff. It's like thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands?

Brendan Foody (00:31:53):
Tens of thousands at any given time, hundreds of thousands more generally. It's huge. And the most exciting thing is that it's growing really quickly. I think that to your question also about the competitive landscape, historically there were all these crowdsourcing companies that would get these super high volumes of low-skilled people. I think Scale and Surge were the primary companies that pioneered that industry. And then in this transition to higher-skilled labor, what people realized is that actually you can go a lot further with just getting higher caliber people even in smaller amounts initially, and now subsequently scaling that back up once they're able to meet the quality bar.

(00:32:35):
And I think that there's a bunch of companies that after our success and very rapid revenue growth that started early last year have chased after that, which makes sense. And seeing that the market was changing very quickly, we were taking off, and trying to pursue a similar thesis on the market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):
It's interesting. There's always been these companies, AlphaSights and GLG, that did this before AI or is paid to connect to an expert and ask them questions about stuff. And essentially, okay, it turns out this is really useful for models. We don't need the person in the middle.

Brendan Foody (00:33:11):
Exactly, yeah. Well, but one core difference is that AlphaSights would generally be a one-off call versus a lot of our work is really hiring people for projects of how do they work on something for a longer period of time. And so that's, I think, one of the reasons that some of the traditional expert networks have struggled to get into this. And also how do you retain those people and think about all the incentives where it actually looks more similar in some ways to one of the traditional labor marketplaces of an Uber or DoorDash, just with much higher-skilled talent that's treated exceptionally well?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):
It's such a good opportunity for me to learn so much about this, so I'm going to ask questions.

Brendan Foody (00:33:55):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
It's so interesting to me. How much of the experts are focused on specific concrete knowledge versus personality and softer skills? How much of it's like, "Here's how you do an exam. Here's how you do an x-ray"?

Brendan Foody (00:34:09):
It depends on the lab. It's a lot of both. I think that previously it might've been more softer skills, but now a lot of the labs are focused on their business models of what are the economically valuable capabilities that drive revenue and leaning a lot into these professional domains. But I think the creative side is also still really important to everyone. And so we're seeing a meaningful amount of both. We hired all the people from the Harvard Lampoon a couple of months ago, their comedy club, to help with making models funnier. And so do all sorts of stuff like that, hiring Emmy award-winning screenwriters and everything across the board on creative capabilities that you'd look for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):
That is amazing. What a cool story. I'm excited for this to kick in. How fast do these things turn around? Say you hired this team, how fast are we going to see the impact potential? Is like months? Is it years?

Brendan Foody (00:35:03):
Well, so it depends, because some models or some labs will release iteratively where they'll just improve the model behind the scenes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:11):
Without announcing a new model?

Brendan Foody (00:35:12):
Exactly. Every couple of weeks versus others do these big releases. And so it depends a lot. We're behind all of them, but we move really fast. It would be a customer gives us a request of we need these award-winning screenwriters, and within 24 hours we'll turn around the experts. And then there's also this really interesting dynamic where in a set of 100 people that we hire, oftentimes the top 10% of people will drive majority of the model improvement. It's like a company. If you have 100-person company, oftentimes the top 10% of the company will drive majority of the impact. And what that means is that when we're able to build proprietary advantages in identifying who are those top 10% of people, both in so far as how do we have them on our platform but also identify and match them effectively, it creates so much value for customers that it's difficult to compete against.

(00:36:08):
And so it really does tie back to the founding thesis of the company, which is how do we find these extraordinary people and identify them so that we can reliably deliver these top 10% or top 10X experiences for our customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:25):
So on that, so is the idea, you hire Jane. She's incredible at coding and she now works for Anthropic and that's her full-time job doing this? Or is this a part-time thing? Is this a project thing mostly?

Brendan Foody (00:36:38):
It would sometimes be part-time. Sometimes it would be full-time. I would say most often it's part-time where it's like someone might work at a thing company where they're underemployed, maybe one of the ones that's moving slower where they have an extra 20 hours a week and then they're able to do this on the side or whatever the equivalent is across a bunch of different industries. But we also do a lot of 40 hour a week roles as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):
And how much are they making? Is it meaningful enough for a AI engineer to spend time on this?

Brendan Foody (00:37:13):
Yeah, very meaningful. So our median pay rate in the marketplace is $95 an hour, but it can flex up, well up into $500 an hour based on the depth of someone's expertise. And one thing that highlights this difference relative to a lot of the crowdsourcing companies is if you look at the economics of the crowdsourcing companies, oftentimes they would pay $30 an hour to town as the average. And so think about the people that you can hire, the undergrads for $30 now versus the Goldman bankers, the McKinsey analysts, the Fang software engineers. And ultimately it comes down to what are the capabilities that labs want their models to have? And it much more falls in the latter bucket than the former one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):
I know there's only so much you can talk about with this stuff, but so Anthropic, Claude has been so good at coding so much better historically than other models. I also use it for writing, giving feedback on writing. What is it that allowed them to get so good at this and continue to be so good at this?

Brendan Foody (00:38:19):
Well, I can't go too much into detail about customer work, but I think that it's this trend of reinforcement learning and being very thoughtful about defining the right rewards that we're releasing across the board. And how we could mitigate reward hacking, set up the right rewards, that's super impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):
Evals. Again, evals is all you need.

Brendan Foody (00:38:44):
Back to evals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):
Yeah.

Brendan Foody (00:38:45):
One of my favorite quotes from customers is that, "Models are only as good as their evals," which has always held true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
I think Greg Brockman tweeted this once. "Evals are all you need."

Brendan Foody (00:38:56):
Yeah, truly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
Let's talk about Mercor a little bit more. One of the maybe, not even maybe, I believe the data tells us it's the fastest growing company in history.

Brendan Foody (00:39:07):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:09):
I want to understand what you did to make this happen. So let me just ask, what do you think are some of the core tenets of how you built Mercor that most contributed to being this successful?

Brendan Foody (00:39:20):
I think the most important thing is looking at the leading indicators in fast-moving markets. I remember when I used to think... Everyone in venture talks about the why now, and I used to think about the why now of how from a product standpoint, less from a market standpoint of now we can automate the way that we review resumes or the way that we conduct interviews, et cetera. But ultimately there is this legacy market that's has all these incumbents and it's relatively stagnant. But what matters a ton is actually figuring out what are the new markets, the new pockets of demand that are changing very quickly where the wealthiest customers in the world are willing to pay whatever it takes to improve model capabilities, and how do we focus on the leading indicators of those markets to make sure that we have the best solution for the flagship customers in the market and optimize everything around that.

(00:40:18):
And that's what I found has been most impactful in building the business. I think maybe that's one thing is leading indicators in markets. If I had to choose another, it's customer obsession. We have had for the last... We're starting to have a couple of product managers help out with go-to-market, but for the last year and a half of the business, we've had no one in sales and marketing. And so we're immature from a sales and marketing standpoint because we focused 100% of company resources on how do we build great products and experiences for our customers. Just getting word of mouth, the people that have worked with us at other businesses want to keep working with us and leaning into creating those great experiences. And so that's where I spend all my time. And I think that some founders can get caught up in how do they get really good at marketing before they've figured out the thing that really drives a lot of customer love and creates the six-star experiences that you're used to building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:19):
I'm going to go back to that first point, which is like, okay, you found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history. How did you first find... What was that moment of, "Wait, this could be really big"?

Brendan Foody (00:41:31):
So there's some crazy stories here. I remember we started the company as I mentioned in January 2023. And then in August 2023 when I was still in college, one of our customers introduced us to the co-founders of xAI over a Zoom call saying how we had these really smart Indian software engineers that were great at math and coding. So we met them and we explained how the software engineers we had were really good at math and coding because they weren't distracted by all the humanities. They didn't have to study history and English and all these other things, and they loved it. So they had us in two days later to the Tesla office and we met the entire xAI co-founding team except for Elon, while I was still a college student. And xAI was just getting started at that point and they were super excited about our focus on the quality of the experts.

(00:42:22):
And so while they were still doing pre-training, they weren't ready for human data at the time and we didn't start working with them at that point. We just knew from that point forward before we even dropped out that the market was about to change radically and we needed to be at the frontier of that. And so then fast-forward a few months, one of the crowdsourcing players came to us and actually used our platform to hire over 1,000 people where this is very interesting experience because we started getting flooded with support tickets about how those people weren't getting paid. And we obviously felt horrible because we had referred them to this opportunity. It was this reputable company. And we realized that a lot of the incumbents were resting on their laurels with respect to what was needed in the experiences they were creating for talent in their marketplaces to help improve models. And there was this opportunity to work directly with the labs in a way that kept the dignity of the experts in the marketplace, paid them extremely well, and cut out the middlemen.

(00:43:31):
And so we started doing that in May of last year, and then the rest is history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:37):
Wow, okay. Hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue since. So what I'm hearing here is you were very open to looking for poll. You saw some poll, you explored it. And then once you saw that there was something really meaningful there, you just went deep on making that an incredible experience as amazing as possible.

Brendan Foody (00:43:57):
Exactly. I think if I had to distill it into advice for founders, one thing I've realized is that I spent a lot of time trying forced product-market fit. And in some ways you should be persistent. You should have these theses that you have conviction about how the world will change. But sometimes you just need to sheer it from the market and know that it's there, the poll, to know the right places to focus. Because if it's difficult to sell, if it's extremely difficult to sell the marginal customer, you're not going to be able to grow a huge business. What you actually need to find is the customer that's surprisingly easy to sell into where you're going to be able to grow with them. You know that it's a large pain point. And so it's some combination of being stubborn with respect to your thesis around how the world will change, but also very open-minded with respect to exactly what form that takes and how the market's developing and how your company will fit into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:55):
That's an amazing insight. In the moments you described, felt like it was a combination of this xAI meeting feeling like, "Oh wow, they really, really want this thing that we have. We're now doing an amazing job," and then it's 1,000 people hiring in the platform. Was that those two moments that are like, "Wow"?

Brendan Foody (00:45:09):
Exactly. And those happened, keep in mind, while we were a seed company, right? Well, so the first one was before we even raised any seed funding, we were totally bootstrapped because we bootstrapped the company to a million dollar revenue run rate and have always remained super capital-efficient. We've never burned money. We were lifetime profitable. And then we raised our seed round in September from General Catalyst, and it was the other experience after we raised our seed round where we really knew that there was an enormous amount of demand in this market where we saw the volume and we saw that the incumbents were sleeping with respect to how the market was changing and the kinds of people that were needed to make that change happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:50):
It's one thing to see this opportunity and start to execute on it. It's another to actually succeed at this scale and consistently win. You guys have very specific values within the business. Talk about those. It feels like that's a big part of your success too.

Brendan Foody (00:46:04):
It totally is. So I'll give the three and maybe a brief story associated with each of them.

(00:46:10):
So the first one is having a can-do attitude, which everyone gives me a little bit of a hard time for because it's a funny saying, but we've always set these ridiculously ambitious goals, and then somehow the trajectory of the company forms around those goals. Where I remember when we were talking to Benchmark before they led our Series A, we were at 1.5 million in run rate. And I said we'd be at 50 million in run rate by the end of the year. And they said we were absolutely insane, right, as anyone would. And plus or minus two weeks, we hit it. And then we've now well blown past the tracking to 500 million in run rate, which was initially our goal for this year. So setting these incredibly ambitious goals with respect to the revenue scale of the business, the caliber of experiences for talent, all those dimensions is super important to first have a can-do attitude.

(00:47:04):
The second thing is really high standards, which is who we hire and what we expect of them. We have an incredibly high hiring bar where we hire tons of former founders, people that have incredible experiences. We just hired or partnered with Sundeep Jain who joined us as president. He was previously the chief product officer and chief technology officer at Uber and joined our relatively small in the grand scheme of things company to help scale up all the processes where Uber is of course the largest labor marketplace in the world. So super high standards is of paramount importance.

(00:47:41):
And then the third one that we really lean on significantly is intensity. And that if you look at the early cultures of the legendary companies, thinking of Meta or Google, they have these incredible, intense early-stage cultures of people just moving heaven and earth and doing whatever it takes to push the frontier of model capabilities. And so still very much output-oriented of what do people achieve rather than input-oriented of the specific hours they work, but recognizing that it takes a lot to build a legendary business, and that's ultimately what we're optimizing for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:18):
I could see why this works. Can-do attitude plus high standards plus intensity, I could see how that leads to success. There's a lot of talk these days about this 6-9-9 culture, working six days a week, 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. A lot of people are like, "Why? That's terrible. Why would you make people do that?" But at the same time, I'm just constantly hearing this from the most successful AI companies. This is just the way it is to be successful. Things are moving so fast. This is an opportunity you'll never see again. Just talk about your thoughts on that.

Brendan Foody (00:48:50):
Yeah. Well, to clarify, we've never mandated hours. It's more been a byproduct of people that care a lot where we care a lot about the trajectory of the business. And so a lot of people come into the office and stay late. But if they need to leave early and get dinner with their kids or travel on the weekend, of course that's totally fine. And for us, it's much more about finding people who have a lot of ownership and are really bought in, less so about the specific hours in the office, even though we found that oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in, not always, but oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in and that burn the midnight oil with us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:30):
When you say high standards, is there something you could share that gives us an example of what you mean there? Because a lot of people think they have high standards and they don't.

Brendan Foody (00:49:37):
If you are very patient, there's always some trade-off between speed and quality when hiring. And I remember especially for our first 10 people, we were just so patient and disciplined about finding some of the best people in the world. Half of them are... Our second employee, Sid, as an example, our second employee in the US, Sid was previously the head of growth at Scale who joined us when we were a seed stage company. Daniel who joined us was previously scaled to consumer apps to over 100,000 users and all sorts of just extraordinary backgrounds of our first 10 hires. And I think that that initial talent density shaped so much of what the rest of the org looks like as you scale it up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:28):
I know you also have this perspective that people talk about waiting to hire, to hire really slowly, but it's actually not necessarily the right advice. Talk about that.

Brendan Foody (00:50:39):
It's painful because it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, I'm thrilled that our first 10 people are so phenomenal and I think that that has paid dividends for the business. But on the other hand, I think that companies do get to the point where you just need to hire really fast. And there's some things where you need a lot of people to do them and you need to recognize that there's going to be some variants associated with hiring, but moving quickly is the priority.

(00:51:07):
And I think that in some ways, we move too slowly with how we scaled out the team. And so the benefit is that everyone is extraordinary. We have this super high bar and we want to maintain that over time. But I think the downside is that while the company has grown incredibly quickly, we likely could have grown even faster if we had moved a little bit more quickly with especially ramping from call, like 10 to 100 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
Okay, I was going to ask. So it sounds like the first 10, be very careful, take your time, 10 to 100, maybe speed up a bit.

Brendan Foody (00:51:44):
Yes, though I wouldn't say it's necessarily 10. It's determined by the point where you know it's really working. And I know that's still not a bright line, but it's like once you know that there's so much more demand than you can handle, that's when you want to step on the gas and optimize for speed in a lot of ways. But I think especially until then, it's important to be patient, be disciplined. Get the best people is always important, but speed becomes more important once you find the market opportunity, the market vacuum.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:20):
I know you've started a couple companies in the past, much smaller scale. In this new role as CEO of this massive hyper growth company, what surprised you most about where you spend the time most or just what the role involves? Because a lot of people want to start companies dream about being in your shoes. What are they maybe not understanding about where a lot of your time goes?

Brendan Foody (00:52:42):
Yeah, it's actually not too surprising. The top two buckets are always working on hiring and time with customers of how do I really deeply understand what customers need and how we can support them? And then how do I build the team and a lot of the processes around that? Of course, there's all of the ad hoc things I didn't expect of dealing with the people questions of how do we set up our levels and our comp bands and all of that, which you learn as you scale a business. But I think that the core places that I spend my time are in line with what I expected as well as what I love doing, which is very fortunate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:27):
So these two companies you've started in the past, maybe share what they work because they're fun, and then how do they help you be successful in this? What's something that they taught you that helped you in your current role?

Brendan Foody (00:53:38):
Yeah, so there's been like a dozen, but I'll choose my favorite two. So when I was in eighth grade, I started Donut Dynasty where I saw that Safeway Donuts were selling for $5 a dozen, and I was amazed because I felt like as an eighth grader, this was such an incredible deal. And I started to bike down to Safeway, buy Safeway Donuts for $5 a dozen, and then go back to my middle school and then sell them for $2 each, running really good margins of course. It sold out super quickly. And so then I need to scale up. So I would pay my mom $20 to drive me in her minivan down to Safeway, buy 10 dozen donuts, go to my middle school, sell them all out.

(00:54:19):
And then the school tried to shut me down because I was selling food on school campus, which they didn't like. So they had me in the principal's office asking me to not do that. And then I moved my donut stand over 50 feet, so it was off school campus, saying that they could no longer police me. I remember we had competitors pop up where the competitors were charging. They bought these Chuck's Donuts, which if anyone in the Bay Area knows, are higher end donuts than Safeway Donuts, but they have a higher cost basis. They cost a dollar per. And so I dropped my prices to $1 for two weeks to run them out of business before I knew what anti-competitive practices were. And I'd hire all my friends, paying my friends in donuts because they perceived the donuts as $2 each where they could sell them throughout the school and I could have a lower cost basis on them.

(00:55:12):
So I had all of these fun experiences in selling donuts, and then I could talk more about my high school business as well, which was a more significant scale. But I think the takeaway from that was just like you can just do things. So many people have ideas, but the barrier to more companies being built, I think, is just initiative and taking the steps to build the product or experience that customers want and investing the time and the ambition to scale that up. And so I think it was really getting reps of that that enabled me to realize that I should do it later on at a much larger scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:51):
Amazing story. I love how wholesome that is versus drugs, selling donuts.

Brendan Foody (00:55:56):
Then my mom was very worried. She was like, "Oh, is there any pot of these donuts?" I was like, "No, mom, I assure you these are pure donuts."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):
I love that you paid your mom $20 to drive.

Brendan Foody (00:56:07):
Yeah. She was adamant it couldn't be a handout that she was taking her time to drive me, so she needed to make a little bit of money off of it. We haggled over her title where eventually she wanted to be head of global operations, which we found very entertaining.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):
I hope that's on her LinkedIn.

Brendan Foody (00:56:24):
Not yet. Maybe she'll have to add it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:27):
So you said that you've started a dozen companies?

Brendan Foody (00:56:29):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):
Wow. Okay.

Brendan Foody (00:56:30):
Well, a dozen projects, but I think it was that, and then my AWS company were the two that I scaled up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:39):
What's the story behind Mercor as the name?

Brendan Foody (00:56:42):
Mercor means marketplace in Latin or to buy, sell, trade. And we want to build the largest marketplace in the world, the marketplace for how everyone finds jobs, and that was really the draw to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):
Okay, maybe a last question. This is going back to earlier in discussion because it's something I've been thinking about as we're talking. There's been this shift from data as the fuel for models, and now it's experts. Do you think there's a next step, or is this just will take us to AGI, superintelligence?

Brendan Foody (00:57:15):
I don't think it's necessarily changing from data to experts. It's more just the paradigm of realizing that labs need this close collaboration with experts to help understand what are the evals that they're building and how can they push the frontier. But I think it's very clear that evals are evergreen, that so long as we want to improve models, we'll need experts to create evals for them and to create the post-training data for them to learn those capabilities. And of course there might be changes in the exact way that people do training with RL or otherwise, but they will always need an eval to measure what does success look like across every domain that they want to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:01):
Okay. So then building on that, a question that comes up a lot these days is, and I know we're talking about fun stuff but I'm getting to serious stuff again, scaling laws and just progression of model intelligence. A lot of people are feeling like, "I don't know, it's slowing down. We're not going to really get to superintelligence at this rate." What is your sense?

Brendan Foody (00:58:21):
I totally agree with that. I know there's been some executives to big labs that say we'll have superintelligence in three years, but I think the truth is that it's a longer road. And that's not to diminish from how extraordinary the models are. I think we'll be able to automate a majority of knowledge work tasks in the next 10 years for sure, but that long road is paved with all of the evals that help to make those capabilities possible. And it's not going to be 10X more pre-training data that gets those capabilities. It's much more going to be all of the post-training data sets that are far more data-efficient and thoughtful that help us get there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:05):
David Sachs tweeted this interesting point that the situation we're now is almost the best case scenario where AI is not in this fast takeoff to superintelligence. There's a lot of competitors keeping each other in check. Models are already very valuable and only getting valuable, more valuable, but there's not just this winner superintelligence taking over the world situation.

Brendan Foody (00:59:26):
Yeah, I think that's true. I think a lot of the super intelligence fearmongering is probably overrated, but at the same time a lot of people's framing around that is even if there is a 5 to 10% chance of this P-Doom, then we should be careful, which seems logical. But I think that it's going to be an extraordinary 10 years for all of Silicon Valley and all of the world as this technology is able to create abundance and giving everyone better medical treatment, the best access to legal recommendations, and the ability to build great products more than we've ever seen before.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):
And education feels like is transforming.

Brendan Foody (01:00:08):
Absolutely, right. I even have felt bits of this over the last 10 years where I remember ever... My parents would give me a hard time for not going to classes in college and I'd be like, well, there's way better lectures on YouTube. Why not just listen there? But I can only imagine as the models get extremely good at conveying information, better than the best professor, what that'll mean and access to all sorts of information to better forward humanity and upskill everyone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
So I'll use that as a segue to a final question. I'm going to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on the podcast. What's some way that you personally use AI to do better work to help you in life?

Brendan Foody (01:00:52):
Well, let's see. I use it a lot to write documents, as you would expect. I also talk to get advice on problems. I find it helpful to just reason through almost as a thought partner because, yeah, I don't know. I find I think better sometimes when I'm talking something through, but I can't talk through everything with colleagues or people around me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):
And so this is like ChatGPT Voice Mode mostly or something else.

Brendan Foody (01:01:16):
Yeah, I like ChatGPT Voice Mode a lot. There's stuff-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
Me too.

Brendan Foody (01:01:21):
... or room for improvement, but I am very excited about the future of Voice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):
Let me show you something I built, actually. I wasn't planning to talk about this, but there's this guy, Eric Antonow, who's been recommended by a lot of people to get him on this podcast. He's this creative product person that's under the radar now. He's at Facebook for a long time. He built this project called Pirate GPT, which is you basically put ChatGPT into a stuffed animal to talk to it. So built a little wise owl. I don't have it on right now.

Brendan Foody (01:01:25):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):
But basically you sew in a little speaker right here and you put a little magnet underneath and you can put it on your shoulder and then you just talk to it.

Brendan Foody (01:01:57):
That's so cute. Wow. I love it. I'll have to get one of those. Because I have some of the voice assistants in my apartment, but I really want a ChatGPT voice assistant, so I'm excited for-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:07):
I was just thinking that. Yeah, just come on. Why can't we have a ChatGPT voice just sitting around listening to us all the time. And you can't on your phone because it goes to sleep and it's like, "Hello, what?"

Brendan Foody (01:02:17):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:18):
Yeah, so it's what this is trying to be. Well, there's a kickstarter he started that we'll link to that. You could help out.

Brendan Foody (01:02:22):
There we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):
That's really easy.

(01:02:25):
Brendan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on or maybe leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lighting round?

Brendan Foody (01:02:32):
Tying to the point around initiative and that you can just do things, I encourage everyone, especially with AI and it being so much easier to build, just take the initiative to go out and build products and talk with customers and take that leap of faith because I think that that is in so many ways, the largest barrier to more innovation, the economy in any way that we can support that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Yeah. There's so many people that just, let's not bash the podcast, but just listen to podcasts, read posts, just keep reading and listening and don't do anything with that information. And there's never been an easier time to actually build stuff and try stuff.

Brendan Foody (01:03:12):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:12):
So definitely take that advice. Just you can do things. You can move your donut stand 50 feet and get out of their jurisdiction.

Brendan Foody (01:03:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:21):
Okay, Brendan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Brendan Foody (01:03:26):
All set.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Brendan Foody (01:03:31):
Let's see. I would say in order, High Output Management is a phenomenal book on running companies. Second is Zero to One, which of course is a classic. And then third is Shoe Dog, where I just find it to be a really inspirational story.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):
What is a recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Brendan Foody (01:03:49):
I really liked Oppenheimer. My favorite TV show of all time is Suits, so I know not recent, but if I had to choose a recent one, probably Oppenheimer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
Very cool. Suits, first time someone's mentioned that. Favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Brendan Foody (01:04:05):
I love using Codex, like the new version. I know it's sort of new in terms of version. Yeah, I think it's incredible and just a huge, huge improvement. So yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):
Do you have a life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with folks, finding useful in work or in life?

Brendan Foody (01:04:25):
I think it's you can just do stuff, what we were talking about earlier. Take the leap of faith.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):
I thought you were going to say can do, which is in your Twitter profile.

Brendan Foody (01:04:34):
Can do as well, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):
Two great ones. Final question. So we were chatting before this about things that we could talk about and you shared this interesting thing that you haven't shared anywhere else, which is that you're dyslexic. Why don't you share that with folks? And just how do you get around that having built the fastest-growing company in history?

Brendan Foody (01:04:55):
I don't hide it at all. I think a lot of my colleagues know. And I think on one hand it definitely makes it difficult to go through 1,000 emails a day or read every document that I'm supposed to, but on the other hand, I feel like it helps me to think a little bit differently, to be more creative, and perhaps see that markets are changing that not everyone sees. And so it's turned out okay so far. And so I think one thing it's helped me realize from a management standpoint is that we focus much more on how we can leverage people's strengths rather than helping to improve weaknesses, because there's some things that I'm not great at and I'll never be the best in the world at, and there's others that I can hopefully refine and strive to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):
That's such a also recurring theme on this podcast of just focusing on strengths and not focusing over all your focus on weaknesses.

(01:05:53):
Brendan, this was incredible. I learned so much. I have a billion more questions, but you got shit to do. Two final questions. What should people know about what you're doing and roles you're hiring for? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Brendan Foody (01:06:06):
Absolutely. We're hiring a ton across the board on our team. We're hiring strategic project leads on our operations team, software engineers in our engineering team, as well as researchers. And so please go to mercor.com and we would love to work with you, and that's the largest way that you can help us. Share it with your friends as well. Over half of people in our marketplace come from referrals because we have a platform of people that love us. And so any jobs that you want to apply to or send your friends to, we would love to have you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):
Brendan, thank you so much for joining me.

Brendan Foody (01:06:39):
Thank you for having me.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You're CTO of Meta. You are a co-CEO of Salesforce, you're chairman of the board at OpenAI. How do you think the AI market is going to play out?

Bret Taylor (00:00:07):
The whole market is going to go towards agents. I think the whole market is going to go towards outcomes-based pricing. It's just so obviously the correct way to build and sell software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
This makes me think about, I had Marc Benioff on the podcast. You guys were co-CEOs. He was extremely agent-pilled.

Bret Taylor (00:00:21):
It's so hard to sell productivity software, which I learned the hard way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
What's a story that comes to mind when you think about your biggest mistake?

Bret Taylor (00:00:27):
I was the product manager for, it was called Google Local had a pretty tough product review with Marissa and Larry, and to not do that well with a link from the Google homepage is embarrassing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
I think it's really empowering for people to hear it's possible to succeed in spite of a massive failure like this.

Bret Taylor (00:00:41):
They gave me another shot to do the V2 of it that resulted in Google Maps. We got about 10 million people using it on the first day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
What mindset contributed to you being successful in such a variety of roles?

Bret Taylor (00:00:52):
Waking up every morning, what is the most impactful thing I could do today?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Bret Taylor. Bret is an absolute legendary builder and founder. He co-created Google Maps at Google. He co-founded the social network, FriendFeed invented the like button and the real-time newsfeed, which he sold to Facebook. He then became CTO at Facebook. He then started a productivity company called Quip, which he sold to Salesforce for $750 million. He then became co-CEO of Salesforce. He's also currently chairman of the board at OpenAI. At one point he was chairman of the board at Twitter. Today, co-founder and CEO of Sierra an AI started building agent to help companies with customer service sales and more.

In our conversation, we cover so much ground, including what skills and mindsets have most helped Bret be so successful in so many roles, why we're all still sleeping on the impact that agents are going to have on the business world. How coding is going to change in the coming years, where the biggest opportunities remain for startups, lessons on pricing and go-to-market in AI, the story behind the like button and so much more.

Bret, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Bret Taylor (00:04:14):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:15):
My pleasure. There's so much that I want to talk about. You've done so many incredible things over the course of your career. Just boggles the mind, the things that you've done, and we're going to talk about a lot of that sort of stuff, but I want to actually start with the opposite. I want to talk about a time that you messed up, a time that you screwed up in a big way. We have this recurring segment on the podcast called Fail Corner, and so, I thought it'd be fun to just start there before we get into all the great stuff you've done. What's a story that comes to mind when you think about maybe your biggest mistake in building a product?

Bret Taylor (00:04:43):
It may not be the biggest, but it was my first prominent mistake as a product manager at Google. So for me, it feels big because it was very formative for me as a product designer. So I joined Google in late 2002, early 2003, and I was one of the earliest associate product managers at the company and first, was working on the search system, essentially expanding our index from 1 billion webpages to 10 billion, which was a big deal at the time. It seems quaint now. Then I did a decent job and so my boss, Marissa Meyer, gave me the opportunity to lead a new product initiative, which was a big bet on me and it was both an opportunity to do something for Google, but I was also being pretty scrutinized just as a young new product manager and the premise given to me was work on local search.

(00:05:40):
At the time, the Yellow Pages was still dominant and well, Google was really good at searching the web. It wasn't really good for finding a plumber or a restaurant just because it wasn't really a huge part of the internet at the time. So this content wasn't necessarily on the internet and even if it was, you didn't really want to find plumbers in Manhattan, you wanted to find plumbers in San Francisco, if you're me. And so it was both a technical problem and a product problem and a content problem.

(00:06:11):
We launched the first version of that product that I was the product manager for, was called Google Local and it was, I'll be a little bit more critical now than I might've been at the time, but it was a little bit of a me too version of Yahoo Yellow Pages, essentially grafting on Yellow Pages search on top of Google Search and with a properly crafted query you could see those listings at the top of your search results but a standalone site at local.google.com. Actually, it was an important enough initiative that actually, there was on the Google homepage, it had Web, Images and Local was up there as well, so it's got top bill.

(00:06:54):
I mean you could put almost any link on the Google homepage and get a lot of traffic to it. And despite that, it didn't do that well and to not do that well with a link from the Google homepage is embarrassing. There's not much one can do more than giving you that kind of traffic to give you an add that as a product leader or a product manager. And the product was fine, it worked, but it really wasn't differentiated. And in many ways, I think, again, I think I've had these reflections more sense than at the time, that I had some of the time, but why use this instead of Yahoo Yellow Pages? But more than anything else, why use this instead of the Yellow Pages? It was a digital version of something that had come before. Had a pretty tough product review with Marissa and Larry and others and it was fine. I wasn't about to get fired or something, but it was, I don't know, the shine on my reputation was waning a little bit.

(00:07:52):
And they gave me another shot to do a V2 of it and I got the impression it wasn't like my last shot, but I certainly was feeling a little dejected from going from a hot shot, new PM to a new thing. So, we spent a lot of time thinking about how can you make something that's just much more compelling and not just a digital version of the Yellow Pages and not just so similar to some of the other products out there. And that ended up being the thread that we pulled that resulted in Google Maps. We had licensed from MapQuest, the ability to put this little map next to the search results, it was always the ugliest part of the product and we always made these backhanded comments about it internally and we spent a lot of time saying, what if we inverted the hierarchy here and made the map the canvas?

(00:08:49):
We ended up finding Lars and Jens Rasmussen who had been working on this Windows mapping product and we got them into the company and started exploring this space and it ended up where, through that exploration we ended up integrating a lot of different products. We ended up integrating mapping local search, driving directions, like all of these products at the time were actually separate product categories and ended up with something that redefined the industry and certainly my career. But it took, I think for me as a product leader, it changed the way I think about product just because there's feature and functionality and then there's like why should I use this thing in the first place? And it was notable, there was a couple of interesting moments.

(00:09:34):
When we launched Google Maps we got about 10 million people using it on the first day, which at that scale of the internet at the time was huge. And then in August of 2005, we integrated satellite imagery from a recent acquisition called Keyhole, which became Google Earth and we got 90 million people using it on the same day. Everyone wanted to look at the top of their house when the imagery came out. And it was really interesting because there's so many subtle product lessons in there. First is, I think as you have these new technologies, rather than literally digitizing what came before, if you can create an entirely new experience, it answers the question for a new customer, why should I give this the time of day? And so, really disassembling the Lego set and reassembling into something new rather than just digitizing what was there before. Certainly, that was the lesson I think in Google Maps, really was native to the platform in a way that a paper map couldn't be and that was a really meaningful breakthrough.

(00:10:35):
And then with satellite imagery, it honestly wasn't the most important part of Google Maps, but it was the sizzle to the steak and it created, I don't think the term viral was a thing people said back then, but it created a viral moment. We were on Saturday Night Live, which is the coolest thing. Andy Samberg in, I think it was called Lazy Sunday rapped about Google Maps and Lars and I were texting each other. We did it. We're on Saturday Live. Mission accomplished. And it was also showing that as you're there thinking about products, there's the why you decide to use a product and then what is the enduring value. And those are deeply related but not all the same thing. And I just learned so many lessons that I took with me for every subsequent product that I worked on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):
That is an awesome story. One I think it's really empowering for people to hear, even you Bret, who I'm going to share all the successes you've had, have had a massive failure with the CEO of Google [inaudible 00:11:30] just like Bret, you screwed up. And it was such a big bet. So one, just it's possible to succeed as you have succeeded in spite of a massive failure like this. And then some of the product lessons you shared, just to highlight a few of these things because I think this is great, is just you will often not win if you just make something that's a better copy of something else, what you want to look for is something that is an entirely new experience, something that's differentiated, something that's a lot more compelling. Let's flip to talk about what you've learned from actually being very successful at a lot of things.

(00:12:02):
So I was looking at your resume and you basically have been very successful at every level of the career ladder and in such a huge variety of roles. So let me just read a few of these things for folks that aren't super familiar with your background. You were CTO of Meta, you were co-CEO of Salesforce, you're also CPO and COO at Salesforce. At Google, you joined as an associate product manager where you famously, you didn't mention this but you rebuilt Google Maps on weekend. We're not going to talk about that. You're chairman of the board at OpenAI. You were chairman of the board at Twitter. You've also founded three different companies, one social network, one productivity docs company called Quip, and now, Sierra. Fun fact, at FriendFeed you invented the like button and I don't know if people know that and also just the newsfeed, I'll just throw that out there to give you some credit.

(00:12:50):
So you're basically an associate product manager, an IC product manager, an engineer, CPO, COO, CTO, CEO of three different companies including a public company. Very rare that somebody is successful at all these types of roles and all these levels. So, let me just ask you this question. What mindsets or habits or just ways of working have you worked on building in yourself that you think have most contributed to you being successful in such a variety of roles and levels?

Bret Taylor (00:13:19):
Yeah. It's actually something I am proud of. I like the fact I've worn different hats. It's actually amusing when I meet colleagues that I've known from one of those jobs, they'll often think of me through the lens of that job. And so, I'll go to meet folks from Facebook and they think of me largely as an engineer. I'll meet folks from Google, they think me largely as a product person. At Salesforce, a lot of the folks there interacted with me as like a, lack of a better word, a suit, the boss. And I'm not sure they think of me as an engineer at all, even though I was still probably coding on the weekends for fun. And one of the things that is a principle for me is to have a really flexible view of my own identity. I probably would self-describe as an engineer, but more broadly I think of myself as a builder and I like to build products and I think companies are one of the most effective ways to build products.

(00:14:17):
There's also things like open source, but I think I'm a huge believer in the confluence of technology and capitalism to produce just incredible outcomes for customers. And as a consequence, I think to really build something of significance, I think to be a great founder, you really need to be able to not have such a ossified view of your identity that you can't transform into what the company needs you to be at that point. And every founder you'll talk to, one day, I think selling is a big part of being a founder. You have to sell investors on wanting to invest in your company. You have to sell candidates on wanting to work at your company. You have to sell customers to want to use the product that your customer produces. You have to have good design taste, not just for your product but for your marketing and essentially, soliciting your customers.

(00:15:09):
You have to have good engineering. If you're building a technology company, the technology comes first. It's why this industry is so transformative. I probably credit, and I've told this story before, but I'm very grateful for her, but I probably credit Sheryl Sandberg for really changing the way I approach new jobs. The story, and I might be embellishment a little bit, but I think it's broadly accurate. So I had just become the chief technology officer of Facebook and when I first got the job, it was the flavor of CTO or that relatively small group reporting into me, but contributed almost as a very senior architect on a number of projects. And then at some point, Mark Zuckerberg reorganized the company and split it into a bunch of different groups. I ended up with a very large group, 100 under me and I was essentially running our platform and mobile groups, products, design engineering.

(00:16:10):
So I went from a handful of reports to, I don't know, over 1,000 or something. It was a big group. And it was the largest management job. I had become a manager at Google, but a modest team. And so, I was doing okay but not great. And I had this moment where Sheryl saw me, I think I was editing a presentation for a partner just because the presentation I got didn't meet my quality bar and I was editing it and griping about it. She pulled me into a room and gave me talking to a little bit about holding my team to as high of a standard as I have. If someone wasn't meeting my expectations, what was my plan to manage them out of the company or... Just giving me management one-on-one.

(00:16:57):
And she's a remarkable mentor in the sense she can give you feedback that's very direct and often, a bit uncomfortable, but you know she cares about you. And so it was the type of feedback you listen to. I went home that night and I was stewing on it and not very happy. I was like, you get naturally a little defensive in those moments. Is that really true? Am I really fucking it up or is she overreacting? And then I woke up the next day, I was like, "No, she's right." And I had realized this subconscious limiter that was limiting my success in the job, which is, I was trying to conform the job to the things I thought I liked to do. So, I was spending a lot of my time on some product and technology things that I was passionate about, thinking I'm the boss. I should focus on what I want to focus on instead of thinking about, okay, I'm running the mobile and platform teams at Facebook. What's the most important thing to do today to make our mobile and developer platform successful?

(00:18:03):
And when I reframed the job that way, I did different things. And the thing that was the biggest pleasant surprise to me was I liked it. I thought I liked engineering and product, but in fact, when I changed an organization and it turned out to be more successful, I derived a great deal of joy from seeing that success. Our developer platform had a lot of partners and when there was an issue there and I'd spend time on partnerships and it worked and our platform became healthier, the partner became more successful. I took pride in that success and then I just started being better at my job and I realized that the actual act of engineering or product design or all the things I thought I liked, what I really liked is impact.

(00:18:49):
And so, that conversation led to my waking up every morning, sometimes literally, but certainly, in the broadest sets of the words saying, "What is the most impactful thing I can do today?" And really thinking almost like, if you had an external board of advisors telling you what are the things where if you focus on them, you can maximize the likelihood that what you're trying to achieve will happen? Sometimes, it's recruiting, sometimes, it's product, sometimes, it's engineering, sometimes, it's sales. And I've become much more self-reflective just about what is important to work on. And I have become much more receptive to doing things that I previously would've said aren't my favorite things to do because I derive so much joy from having an impact that I enjoy a lot more things now. And so, I really credit Sheryl, I'm so grateful. And actually, it's interesting, I think a lot about this when I give feedback to people now, just those moments that can change the trajectory of your career. I give her all the credit for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):
There's so many people that share stories of Sheryl Sandberg giving them advice and that changing their life. What a mensch.

Bret Taylor (00:20:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
My biggest takeaway from this, which is this question of what is the most impactful thing I could do today? Such a powerful heuristic just to keep in mind. To your point, you may realize you don't want to be doing sales or hiring, but if that's the most impactful thing and you end up doing it, you may realize I like this and I'm good at this and have thought about-

Bret Taylor (00:20:18):
Can I double click on that though for a second?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:19):
Absolutely.

Bret Taylor (00:20:20):
I think it's really hard. One of the dangers for founders and product managers, but I think particularly for founders is incorrect storytelling. People don't like my product because of X. And if you tell that to yourself and you tell it to your team, all of a sudden, it goes from being an intuition to being a fact. Well, you better hope you're right because if you orient your strategy around fixing a problem and you're wrong, your company's going to fail. So why did you lose a deal? You could talk to the salesperson who is on the account or perhaps maybe a product manager was involved in the conversation. It's very important to have intellectual honesty in those moments because you could say something like, "Oh, they didn't buy it because the platform cost too much." And that's something a salesperson might say.

(00:21:16):
Maybe the real reason is they didn't actually see much value in your platform. So it was communicated to the salesperson as it was too expensive. But in fact, the problem was product differentiation. And you could end up going into a discussion on pricing when in fact, there was a much deeper, much harder problem to solve there. But just like when you break up with someone, you don't say, it's because I don't like you anymore. You say it's not you, it's me. You say all these pleasantries because we're all social animals and you want to be pleasant with the people around you. So literally taking what a customer says or what a user says in a focus group or a usability study is rarely correct. It often is related to what the truth is, but it's very important to get right. And so, I think one of the things I've observed with first time founders in particular is you're often a single issue voter based on your skillset.

(00:22:14):
So if you're a great engineer, the answer to almost every problem in your business is engineering. If you're a product designer, the answer almost to the proverbial redesign, I joke, it's like the dead cap balance of a consumer product like this next redesign will fix all of our problems. I don't know if it's ever, ever worked. And then I met a lot of entrepreneurs who come from a business development background, they're always thinking about partnerships and oh, if we just get this partnership done for this distribution channel, everything's going to change. And I think it's really important when you're a founder to be self-aware that you will naturally, subconsciously pick the thing that is your strength, your superpower as a solution to more problems. And in fact, if you think that's a solution to your problem, it may be right, but you probably by default should question it.

(00:23:03):
If you think the thing that you've been doing your whole career is the way to fix your problem, it's at least 30% likely that you've chosen that because of comfort and familiarity not truth. And so, I think one of the skills I think is, it really goes around to do you have a good co-founder? Do you have a good leadership team? If you're a product manager, you're a partner in engineering, you're a partner in marketing, you really want to have very real conversations to ensure that you're actually working on the actual correct thing. And I think it's easy to say what's the most impactful thing to do today? My guess, if a lot of people try that, they'll lie to themselves more often than not. And it's a very challenging question to answer. The question's interesting. Being able to answer it accurately is actually the hard part.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:50):
This feels like such an important lesson you've learned. Is there an example that comes to mind where you learned this the hard way where you actually ended up-

Bret Taylor (00:23:57):
Oh, yeah. You just want to spend this whole thing on my failures, but I'm fine with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):
You've had too much success.

Bret Taylor (00:24:04):
Frontier was my first company. At our peak we had 12 employees, 12 of the best people I've ever worked with. Started the company with Jim Norris, who's an engineer I've known since Stanford and Paul Buhite and Sanjeev Singh who Paul started Gmail. Sanjeev was the first engineer at Gmail, so we had the Google Maps people and Gmail people. It was a pretty awesome founding team. We made a social network, as you said. We invented a lot of concepts that became popular in the newsfeed. We invented the like button. It was really neat. It was a fun time. We were only really popular in Turkey, Italy and Iran, and at one point, we were blocked in Iran, so we were only popular in Turkey and Italy and Silicon Valley. To this day, actually a lot of folks in Silicon Valley are like, "I love FriendFeed." I'm like, that's awesome.

(00:24:51):
It wasn't really a successful business. We were a follower-oriented social network, not a friendship-oriented social network, which meant a lot of our content was more like X or Twitter than it is Facebook in that respect. And a lot of sharing newspaper articles, interests, scientific communities, things like that. And there was a period when Twitter, which was one of our competitors at the time, that there was a lot more social networks at the time. I am probably screwing this up a little bit. I think Obama, Ashton Kutcher and Oprah Winfrey all went on Twitter in a summer and we just got our ass kicked.

(00:25:31):
And it was a great example of you... I think 11 of those 12 people were engineers and we were just making product and I think it was Biz Stone. If you talk to the Twitter folks, they could give you the history on this, but I think Biz was really focused on getting celebrities and public figures onto Twitter, which is totally obvious. If you have a social service that's oriented towards following people, put some people on there worth following and instead, we were exclusively focused on polishing the product.

(00:26:00):
And we actually, I think at our peak of popularity, we were very confident just, I think it was a time when Twitter had the fail whale and it was down half the time and people couldn't even use it. And our product, we were innovating faster, we had more features, people liked it and we were up 100% of the time and we totally lost for no reason related to product at all. And it was an example of, I think somewhat famously not a lot of great entrepreneurs have come out of Google because Google was so successful, I think it's hard as a product manager to see distribution and product design and even business model when you have AdWords and money's raining from the sky. There wasn't as much scrutiny and I think folks like the PayPal Mafia I think learned a lot more about entrepreneurialism than a typical PM at Google. So, we're just getting punched in the face and learning this the hard way.

(00:26:57):
And so, that was probably the most prominent example of it and I think we probably did have a... I can tell you all the flaws of that product, but I don't think that was the reason why we lost. There's a lot of reasons. I think there was a lot of flaws of the product, but it was a lot of other stuff. And so, I've learned, accumulated these skills over time, but I say the hard part of that question is answering it correctly, is it's hard when you don't have experience in something, than to have intuition in it. So I think if there's probably a structural flaw, it wasn't that... I don't know if I could have figured out how to reach out to Ashton Kutcher [inaudible 00:27:28], it's not he's on my Rolodex. But I probably wasn't soliciting advice from the right people.

(00:27:36):
I think that what's great about the technology industry is there's a lot of advice. Choosing whom you listen to is actually quite difficult, but I think we're somewhat myopic. We're in our own little world, creating this product and we weren't asking people from the outside in to say, what are you seeing that could go wrong? What are you seeing that could go right? What are you seeing in the industry that we're not doing that you think we might want to do? And this is why boards are important. This is why finding the right advisors, the advisors will actually tell you what you not [inaudible 00:28:09] want to hear, but you need to hear. I think that was probably the missing part. I'm not sure I was great at market at the time, but if I had solicited the right advice, I could have learned that that was a shortcoming. And I think that was a deep lesson I took from that. I'm a huge believer in boards and getting good advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:26):
Any heuristics or advice for people to know whose advice to listen to? What do you pay attention to when you're like, okay, ignore this person but listen to this person?

Bret Taylor (00:28:35):
Yeah, that one's tough. It does come down to good judgment and being judge of people's character. One thing that is particularly hard is there's not a strong correlation between the confidence with which someone expresses an opinion and the quality of that opinion. I don't want to say it's inversely correlated, but that's funny, with all the podcasts out now, if there's topics I know a lot about, sometimes the most eloquent, confident statements about things I know a lot about, are the least accurate and it sounds extremely persuasive. And so, it does require very good judgment. One thing is I think, not just asking for advice but asking people, who should I talk to get good advice? And you'll find some common answers there and that's often a really strong signal of good judgment.

(00:29:26):
And then one thing I found is when you ask for advice, don't just ask what to do but why. Be an obnoxious two-year-old kid, why? Why? Why? Why? And really try to understand the framework that someone is using to give you advice. The interesting thing about advice is people are often extrapolating from relatively few experiences. So they will say, never do this or always do that. And it's because they had one experience where something backfired or something could have gone better if they had done it. So it's a useful anecdote, but if you don't ask why and understand they had one experience and here's what happened, it can come across as a rule when in fact, it's [inaudible 00:30:08] data and if you ask advice of three people and they all have very similar interactions, you can create a first principles framework from which that advice emerges. And when you start applying it, you're applying it with a degree of nuance that you couldn't if you're just following a rule. So, I think one is, it does come down to good judgment, I think. I don't know how to teach that.

(00:30:30):
I'm a huge believer in good judgment. It's one of the things I hire for. I just think that's something that probably comes from a mix of self perfection. You really need to hold yourselves accountable as an entrepreneur, as a product manager. If you made a bad decision, spend time reflecting on it, number one. And really, try to understand why and try to always improve your judgment. I think at the end of the day, that is why you are a good entrepreneur, a good product manager. And number two, when you get advice, really understand where it's coming from and why so that you can create your own independent view of where that advice came from and recognize that no one's advice is statistically significant or very rarely is it. If you're getting advice on investing from Warren Buffett, yeah, okay, it's statistically significant, but most advice is like something happened to you once and you have regrets.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:28):
I love that you're like, I don't know if I have a great answer then you just give us an incredible answer to this question. I want to go in a different direction. You mentioned that you describe yourself as an engineer. I know I heard you code to relax still. Let me just ask you this question, something a lot of people in college are thinking about. Do you think it still makes sense to learn to code? Do you think this will significantly change in the next few years?

Bret Taylor (00:31:47):
I do still think studying computer science is a different answer than learning to code, but I would say I still think it's extremely valuable to study computer science. I say that because I think computer science is more than coding. If you understand things like Big O notation or complexity theory or study algorithms and why a randomized algorithm works and why two algorithms with the same Big O complexity, one can then practice perform better than others and why a cache miss matters and just all these little... There's a lot more to coding than writing the code. The reason I think that is I do think the act of creating software is going to transform from typing into a terminal or typing into Visual Studio code to operating a code-generating machine. I think that is the future of creating software. But I think operating a code-generating machine requires systems thinking and I think that computer science, there are other disciplines as well, but computer science is a wonderful major to learn systems thinking and at the end of the day, AI will facilitate creating this software.

(00:33:08):
We may do a lot more in the next few years we can't even imagine, but your job as the operator of that code-generating machine is to make a product or to solve a problem and you really need to have great systems thinking and you're going to be managing this machine that's doing a lot of the tedious work of making the button or connecting to the network. But as you're thinking of the intersection of a technology and a business problem, you're trying to affect a system that will solve that problem at scale for your customers and that systems thinking is always the hardest part of creating products.

(00:33:40):
I'll just give you, it's this cheesy simple example, but I think it's representative. At Facebook, we spent a lot of time designing the newsfeed and if you ever had a really, really good designer and they showed you at the time, a Photoshop mock-up of the newsfeed, it was just all as beautiful. The photos, the family was happy and the photo was a perfect photo and the posts were all perfectly grammatically correct and of a completely normal length and the comments and there was the like... Everything was just perfect. And then you'd implement that design and you'd look at your own newsfeed and it looked like shit because it turns out not everyone's photos were made by a professional photographer. The posts were all these different lengths. The comments were like, you suck and... All that stuff.

(00:34:29):
And then all of a sudden you realize that designing a newsfeed, Photoshop is the easy part. You need to actually design a system that produces both in content and visual design, like a delightful experience given input you don't control. And that's a system, it's sort of a design and it's just, what we did practically, I am sure it's changed a lot since I left in 2012, but we made a system so designers had to show their newsfeed designs with real newsfeed data that was messy rather than anything artificial because I think it forced the process to be more realistic.

(00:35:10):
But I say that because I think that whether AI is writing code or doing the design or doing all these other things, you need to learn how to have a system in your head. You need to understand the basics of what's hard and what's easy and what's possible and what's impossible. And AI can help you do that too, by the way. But I do think that's a really useful skill. I think in general, with the advent of AI agents and AI approaching super intelligence in certain domains, I think the tools with which we do our job will change a lot. I think it's very important to have a very loose attachment to the way we do our jobs and that story that we won't talk about when I rewrote Google Maps, everyone talks about that story and I think it's because of Paul [inaudible 00:35:57] who told it on some podcasts and that's where it made the rounds.

(00:36:01):
I think that's going to end up this vestige of the past, almost like the human calculators at NASA before the computers were invented, like wow, a person was a calculator? Whoa, that's fun. Tell me that story. I think just what I was good at will no longer be useful in the future or certainly not valuable in the future and that's okay. So I think we need to have a really loose view of it, but the idea that you shouldn't study these disciplines, it's like people say, I don't want to study math because I'm not going to use it in my career for X. Well, studying maths is quite important. It teaches you how to think. It teaches you how the world works, physics, math, and I think computer science especially, at least the foundations of it, will continue to be the foundations of how we build software and understanding that when you're interacting particularly with something that's smarter than you, producing code you might not completely understand how you constrain it and how you get it to produce these outcomes. I think it will require a lot of sophistication actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):
That's such a great answer. There's this always sense of this binary, should I learn to code or not? And your point here is learn to understand how engineering works and how systems work and what your code does and how it all interconnects, but the way you actually do the coding at your desk will change significantly. This reminds me of something you mentioned on a podcast recently. This idea that you think there's going to, or there should be a new programming language that is more designed for LLMs versus humans. Can you just talk about that because I think a lot of people aren't thinking about that?

Bret Taylor (00:37:27):
I don't know if it's a language, I would call it a programming system because I think language might be too limited. My reductive version of the past, what 40 years of computers maybe more, is we created the hardware for computers, then we created punch cards, which is the way in the late '70s you would tell a computer what to do or maybe mid to late '70s. Then we invented early operating systems and time-sharing systems from the invention of things like Unix at Bell Labs and Berkeley, you ended up with the C programming language, Fortran and a lot of higher level programming languages. I think Fortran and then C.

(00:38:15):
And we moved up the layers of abstraction. No one does punch cards anymore, obviously. Few people write assembly language. Some people write C, some people write REST. But a lot of people write Python and TypeScript and things like that. And as we've invented more and more abstractions, we've made it easier to do high-leverage things. So, if you look at how remarkable Google was back in the day or Google Maps, you could probably give a lot of react programmers the task of make a draggable map now and I think a lot of people could do it. That was true RND back in the day.

(00:38:54):
When Salesforce was created in 1998, just putting a database in the cloud was hard and that alone was a technical moat that is now trivial with Amazon Web Services and that technical moat is comically narrow, but the product moat is quite large. I think that if the act of writing code is going from something that is very costly to the marginal cost of that going to zero, how many of the abstractions that we've built are based on human program or productivity? I think a ton. I always laugh that I assume Python is probably the most common generated code just because of how much it's in the training data and data scientists love Python and I love Python too. It's such a comically bad thing for AI to generate just because it's one of the most inefficient programming languages of all time. If you know the global interpreter lock and just slow. And I've written a lot of high-scale web services and it's just quite slow and it's very hard to verify.

(00:40:00):
It's not as bad as Perl, but if you have a big Python program, how many errors will you find at runtime versus before releasing it? So, Python was designed to be very ergonomic, almost looked like pseudo code for humans, for me to write code in a delightful way. That's why data scientists love it so much. So as we move to a world where let's just postulate, and I'm not sure this will be completely true, that we're not going to write a lot of code as people. We're going to be operating these code-generating machines. We probably don't care how ergonomic the programming language is. What we care about is when this machine generates code, do we know that it did what we wanted it to do? And if it doesn't do we want it to do, can we change it easily? I think there's a lot of insights in programming languages that could serve this.

(00:40:48):
So Rust I think, is interesting because if I asked you to look at a C program and say, "Does it leak memory?" You probably couldn't do it that well just because it's really hard and if it's a very, a million line C program, it's going to be very, very hard. If I asked you to verify that a Rust program doesn't leak memory, you would just have to compile it. And because it has compile time, memory safety, just the act of compiling successfully tells you that's true. I think we need more things like that because if an AI is generating this code, by definition, if you have to read every line that is going to be the limiting factor for producing the code or worse, you're just not going to read every line and you're going to emit a bunch of unsafe unverified code into the wild.

(00:41:36):
And so, the question is how do you enable humans to have as much leverage as possible? Which means using computers to do the work on your behalf. You could have obviously the simplest form of this, is AI supervising AI and doing code reviews and that's great. Certainly, self-reflection is a really effective way of improving the robustness of an AI system. But I do think if it doesn't matter how tedious it is to write the code, you could probably layer on some techniques that are out of fashion, like formal verification, unit testing, other things. And if you layer all these on, I'm thinking about it as, I as a... It's like the guy in the matrix with the green letters coming down, how can I make something so I as a operator of the code generating machine can produce incredibly complex scale software, incredibly quickly and know that it works?

(00:42:26):
If you start with that as your design center, I think you'd probably changed the languages, you'd probably changed the systems, you'd probably change all these things and you're probably going to bring to bear a lot of things. And what's really fun about it is you can loosen a lot of constraints, like coding is free. Okay, so that's neat. With that in mind, what do you want to do? What would be best suited for the language, the compiler for testing, for self-reflection, for supervisor models, all these things. I think that's more of a programming system than a language, but I think when we create something like that, it can really enable creators, builders to create incredibly robust, incredibly complex systems.

(00:43:04):
And I'm super excited about VibeCoding, but I don't know generating a prototype has been the limiting factor in software ever. It's actually building increasingly complex systems and actually changing them with agility. If you look at the famous Netscape one to Netscape two rewrite, somewhat, a lot of people attribute that to part of their failure against Internet Explorer. It's like making these things is not hard. Maintaining them is hard and ensuring they're robust is hard. And I think we're in the very early phases of defining what this new system for developing software looks like and I'm very excited to see what emerges.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:42):
I feel like we're definitely living in the future when someone like you is suggesting that we build a matrix like experience and that's going to be potentially the future of coding and building. I can't wait for that. It feels like a great opportunity and a fun project.

(00:43:57):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta and I'm very excited to have Christina Cacioppo CEO and co-founder Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:06):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):
Vanta is a long time sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:16):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018 focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 2701. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies including some start-up household names like Atlassian Ramp and LangChain, start and scale their security programs and ultimately, build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:54):
That is very much our experience, but before the company and to some extent, during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
We appreciate you for doing that. And you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny. That's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:45:25):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):
Okay. One more question along these lines and then I want to zoom out on just where AI is heading and something I love to ask folks like you that are at the cutting edge of AI is what you're teaching your kids. I know you have kids, I feel like the world is going to be very different when they grow up. What are you encouraging them to learn that you think is different maybe from previous generations to help them be successful in a world of AI abundance?

Bret Taylor (00:45:53):
I don't know if I'm teaching them differently, but I'm really trying to encourage them to make AI a part of their lives. I was reflecting actually when I took the AP calculus exams in '97, '98 AB and BC, I could use a graphing calculator. And I haven't done this research I was meaning to plug this into ChatGPT before our conversation, but I'll do it after. Did the calculus exam change before and after they allowed the calculator in the exam? I assume it did. But essentially, to when you allow the calculator in the exam, you need to make sure that none of the questions benefit people for having a calculator or not, which actually forces you to rethink the problems to test calculus knowledge that don't benefit from like road arithmetic or the other things you can do on a graphing calculator.

(00:46:47):
I think that a lot of education doesn't presume you have a super intelligence in your pocket. And so, if you ask someone to write an essay on a book that they read, you could probably hallucinate one pretty easily from one of the big providers like ChatGPT. And maybe if you are skilled enough that prompting, maybe even your teacher won't know it's written by an AI. So what do you do? How do you teach kids differently? It's really hard for teachers right now because I think we haven't gone through the transition of adding calculators to the exams. So, I think a lot of the mechanisms we have to evaluate students are broken by the existence of ChatGPT and the like. So I think we're in a very awkward phase, but I think we can still both teach kids how to think and teach kids how to learn. And I think our education system can catch up and I actually think these models can be one of the most effective educational tools in history.

(00:47:46):
I don't know if you're a visual learner or reading learner. I like to read. I didn't love going to lectures. I don't learn that well from them. I like to read the book and if you have a teacher who doesn't teach in your style, you can now go home and ask ChatGPT to teach you in another mechanism. My kids use ChatGPT to quiz them before a test. You can use audio mode or chat mode. It's better than cue cards. My daughter took home a Shakespeare book, she took a picture of a page she didn't understand and ChatGPT explained it to her way better than I would've as well. I think every child in this world has a personalized tutor that can teach them in the way that they best learn, visually, over audio, reading. We have a platform that can test you, that can quiz you. I think it's really an amplifier of agency.

(00:48:39):
I think the kids who have agency, who have aspirations to learn something, I think you have what is the best combination of every teacher you've ever had and these models and you can use it. So with my kids, my oldest daughter learned how to code and she was making a website and every time she had a question for me, I would just make her use ChatGPT. Not because I was trying to be an obnoxious father, but I'm like she needs to learn to use this tool because it's amazing.

(00:49:13):
So, I really am trying to have them learn how to use it constructively in their lives. But all that said, I just feel a ton of empathy for public school teachers right now. It's very hard because the technology is moving faster than our educational system. And I think particularly as it relates to evaluation, it's just really challenging for teachers right now. And I worry because these technologies amplify agency, the opposite can also be true. If you are a student trying to not learn something, I think these tools probably provide a lot of mechanisms to avoid it as well. And so, I think there's a challenge for parents and teachers and I think we're going to end up with a handful of years here.

(00:49:53):
But I brought up the calculus AP exam because obviously, a graphing calculator is not ChatGPT, don't get me wrong. But I think we've been able to figure out a way to conform homework and in-class learning and tests around the technologies available to us fairly successfully to date. And I'm fairly confident we'll figure it out and I think it's going to... And on the much more positive side, I don't know, I went to public schools, I don't know if you did too. You end up with some pretty bad teachers at times and now, you have an outlet. You don't need to be the rich kid who can afford a tutor anymore to get tutoring. If you are a kid who excels in math and your school doesn't have advanced statistics classes, well, now you do.

(00:50:40):
So I think this is just an incredibly democratizing force with kids who have agency and I think that's very exciting. I'm hopeful that there's a 11-year-old right now who's going to start a really amazing company 10 years from now whose ChatGPT is going to be their primary tutor that led to that outcome. And I think that's pretty cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:02):
I have a two-year-old and it feels like there's a new milestone of, there's like when to give them a phone, when to give them, I don't know, Snapchat, whatever kids use these days and then it's like when to give them their first ChatGPT account. Well no, I wonder how soon that's supposed to happen.

Bret Taylor (00:51:16):
I think my personal take is, it's different than the former two. I don't think mobile phones are great in school or great for kids and I personally advocate for waiting a long time. But I think that ChatGPT is more like Google search and it's one thing to have a device in your pocket that's addictive and has push notifications, but it's another thing to use AI to learn. And so, I think the two are different. And I really think of AI fundamentally as a utility. I don't think a lot of parents before ChatGPT said, "When should I let my kid use Google search?" That's a different type of tool. I think thinking of it like that is the way I think about these technologies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):
Is the form factor for your kids like an iPad or a laptop or something?

Bret Taylor (00:51:58):
Yeah. They use the computer on the desk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:01):
Got it. All right. Good tips. This is good for me to learn all these things as my kid ages. Okay, I'm going to zoom out and let's talk about business strategy AI. One of the biggest questions a lot of founders think about these days is just where should I build? What will foundational model companies not squash and do themselves? Being someone building a very successful AI business and also being on the board of OpenAI, feel like you have a really unique perspective on what is probably a good idea and it's probably not a good idea. How do you think the AI market is going to play out and where do you think founders should focus and also just try to avoid?

Bret Taylor (00:52:36):
I think there's three segments of the AI market that will end up fairly meaningful markets and then I'll end with how I think it's going to play out. So first is the frontier model market or foundation model market. I think this will end up the small handful of hyperscalers and really big labs just like the cloud infrastructure as a service market. And the reason for that is that creating a frontier model is entirely a function of CapEx. And you need a company with huge amounts of CapEx capacity to build one of these models. All of the companies that were startups that tried to do this have already been consolidated or almost all of them, inflection, adapt, character and others. And I think there doesn't appear to be a viable business model for a startup because of the amount of CapEx required and there's just not enough fundraising runway to get to escape velocity. And also, the models deteriorate in value fairly quickly as an asset class.

(00:53:33):
And so, you need just a lot of scale to make a return on the investment for a model that deteriorates in value so quickly. So, I think that's going to end up probably no entrepreneur should build a frontier model. That's my take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):
Unless you're Elon.

Bret Taylor (00:53:51):
Yeah. Oh, yeah. He's different. And he has the capacity to raise billions in capital and my guess is most of your other listeners don't, and then he is the greatest of all time for reason and he's different. You don't compare yourself to him. The other part of the market is the tooling, and I think there's a lot of folks selling pickaxes in the Gold Rush. This is data labeling, services. This is data platforms, it's eval tools. More specialized models like 11 Labs has a great set of voice models that a lot of companies use that are really high quality and it's like if you're trying to be successful in AI, what are the different tools and services that you need?

(00:54:31):
There is some risk to the tooling market because it's pretty close to the sun. So, if you look at the infrastructure as a service market and the cloud tooling market like the Confluent and Databricks and Snowflake, a lot of the Amazon and Azure and others have competing products in those areas because they're very adjacent to the infrastructure itself and every infrastructure provider is trying to differentiate by moving up the stack and you're right there.

(00:54:57):
So, there's some real meaningful companies as I mentioned, like Snowflake, Databricks, Confluent and others, but there's a lot of others that were obviated by technology from the infrastructure providers themselves. So those companies probably are the most at risk for a developer day from one of these big foundation model companies releasing exactly what they do. So there's probably a lot of people who need your tool, but the question will be if or when is probably the right way to think about it, one of these large infrastructure providers introduces a competitor, why will people continue to choose you? So it's a good market but it's a little bit close to the end as I said.

(00:55:38):
Then there's the applied AI market. I think this will play out for companies who build agents. I think agent is the new app. I think that's going to be the product form factor. There's companies like Sierra, we help companies build agents to answer the phone or answer the chat for customer experience and customer service. There's companies like Harvey that make agents for both a legal, paralegal profession, anti-trust reviews, reviewing contracts etc, etc. There's companies that do content marketing. There's companies that do supply chain analysis. I think this is like the software as a service market. They'll probably be higher margin companies because you're selling something that achieves a business outcome as opposed to being a byproduct of the models themselves. They will almost certainly pay taxes down to the model providers, which is why those model providers will end up extremely large scale but probably slightly lower margin and I think the market for them will be probably less technical.

(00:56:37):
If you think about the purest form of software as a service, it's not like you ask what database do you use? It's really about the feature and function. I think that's where agents will go. I think it's going to be more about product than it is about technology over time. Just going back to my metaphor, in 1998 when Mark and Parker started Salesforce, just getting that database running in the cloud was like a technical achievement. Nowadays, no one asks about that because you can just spin up a database in AWS or Azure and it's like no problem. I think today, orchestrating an agentic process on top of the models, sounds really fancy and it's really hard and all that stuff. I'm pretty sure that's going to be easy in three or four years. It's just like just as the technology improves. And so, over time you say, what is an agent company? Well, it looks a little bit like [inaudible 00:57:30] as a service.

(00:57:30):
You talk a little bit less about how you deal with the models in the same way modern SaaS, few people ask what database you use, but you'll probably ask a lot about the workflows and what business outcomes that you're driving. Are you generating leads for a sales team? Are you minimizing your procurement spend? Whatever value you're providing, it's going to slowly evolve towards that.

(00:57:53):
I'm very excited. I don't think startups should probably build foundation models. But you can shoot your shot if you have a vision for the future, go for it. But I think it's probably a challenging market that's already consolidated. I'm very excited about the other two markets. I'm particularly excited as building agents becomes easier, to see a lot of long tail agent companies come out. I was looking at a website for the top 50 software companies in the stock market and obviously, the top five are the big, big boom ones like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, all that, but the next 50 are all SaaS companies and some of them are very exciting, some of them are super boring, but this is how the software market has evolved and I think we're going to see something similar with agents.

(00:58:38):
It's not just going to be these huge markets like we're in customer service and software engineering. It's going to be a lot of things where people are spending a lot of time and resources that an agent can just solve, but it requires an entrepreneur who actually understands that business problem, and deeply, and I think that's where a lot of the value is going to be unlocked in the AI market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:00):
That is incredibly helpful. This makes me think about, I had Marc Benioff on the podcast, you guys were co-CEOs and he was extremely agent-pilled. All he wanted to talk about was Agentforce. Clearly you're also very agent-pilled. What is it that-

Bret Taylor (00:59:14):
I've never heard the term agent-pilled [inaudible 00:59:18].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:18):
Clearly you guys saw something that was just like, okay, we need to go all in on agents. This is the future. What is it you think people are missing about just why this is such a critical change in the way software is going to work? What are people not seeing?

Bret Taylor (00:59:31):
If you talk to an economist like Larry Summers who, on the OpenAI board with me, they'll talk about what is the value of technology? Will it help strive productivity in the economy. And if you look at one of the big jumps in productivity in the economy was in the '90s, and I think a lot of folks I talked to think it was actually that very first wave of computing where people made ERP systems and just put accounting into computers and databases, even mainframes, we're talking like the PC era. Because it was such a huge step-up, just imagine the ledgers of numbers that you'd have for a large multinational company before and it truly just transformed departments.

(01:00:14):
I'll give you a little toy example. My dad just retired. He was a mechanical engineer and he was talking about when he first started his career in the late '70s and he went into a mechanical engineering firm, the majority of the firm were drafts people. So basically, you take an engineering design but you needed to do all the different vantage points and for all the different floors and to give to the contractor to do the thing. Now, there are zero drafts people at his company. You just make the design in first AutoCAD and now Revit and it's a 3D model and the drafting has actually been eliminated. It's just not a thing one needs to do anymore. The actual design and drafting, drafting is not a thing that exists. It's just a design. That's true productivity gains, right? It's like the job of the mechanical engineering firm was to do a design. The drafting was this necessary output for the contractor, but it wasn't really adding value. It was just like the supply chain change.

(01:01:12):
If you look at the history of the software industry from the PC on, there's been meaningful productivity gains but just not nearly as meaningful as that first huge jump. And I'm not smart enough to know exactly why, but it is interesting, the promise of productivity gains from technology hasn't been as realized I think as some people thought. I think agents will truly start to bend the curve again like we did in the very early days of computing because software is going from helping an individual be slightly more productive to actually accomplishing a job autonomously. And as a consequence, just like you don't need drafts people in a mechanical engineering firm, you just won't need someone doing that thing anymore. It means they can do something else that's higher leverage and more productive and you can actually... A smaller group of people can accomplish more and truly drive productivity gains in the economy.

(01:02:15):
And I think if you've ever sold enterprise software, you end up in these discussions as a vendor with the customer where you'll have a value discussion and you'll do these somewhat convoluted things like okay, it's like you're selling a sales thing. Okay, well, if every salesperson sells 5% more... And you should pay us a million dollars. And it's roughly that conversation and it's so unattributable especially... And it's why it's so hard to sell productivity software, which I learned the hard way, it's just hard to know what's the value of making everyone 10% more productive? Did you actually make them 10% more productive or did something else change? You don't really know all these things. But now with an agent actually accomplishing a job, not only is it actually truly driving productivity in a very real way, but it's measurable as well.

(01:03:10):
So all those things combined means I think this is actually a step change in how we think about software because it does a job autonomously, which is more self-evident, a productivity driver. It's measurable so people value it differently as well, which is why I also believe in outcomes-based pricing for software.

(01:03:32):
And all of that combined to me, it feels like as significant as the cloud or I think more technologically, but just in terms of how it transforms the business model of the software industry where there's going to be a before and after. I don't know how many people still sell perpetually licensed on premises software, but it's de minimis at this point. I think we're going to go through a similar transition. The whole market is going to go towards agents. I think the whole market is going to go towards outcomes-based pricing, not because it's the only way, but the market is going to pull everyone there because it's just so obviously the correct way to build and sell software.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):
Let me pull on that last thread. So we had Madhavan on the podcast recently, pricing expert, legend, monetizing innovation author and he talked about pricing strategy for AI companies and he was very much in your camp of, if you can, you need to price your product as an outcome-based product and the access uses exactly what you shared, which is, you can do that if you can attribute the impact and it's autonomous, it's running on its own. And he actually used Sierra as one of the shining examples of this being successful. Can you just briefly just explain a little bit what is outcome-based pricing for people that haven't heard this term before and then just how does it work for Sierra to give an example?

Bret Taylor (01:04:45):
Yeah, I'll start with the example and then I'll broaden it. So at Sierra, we help companies make customer facing AI agents primarily for customer service, but more broadly, for customer experience. So if you have a problem with your [inaudible 01:04:58], you'll call or chat with Harmony, who's their AI agent. If you have ADT home security and your alarm doesn't work, you can chat with their AI agent. Sonos speakers, a lot of different consumer brands. And if you think about running a call center, there's a cost for every phone call that you take. Most of it is labor costs, but if you have, let's just say a typical phone call is anywhere between 10 and $20 USD. Some of it's software, some of it's telephony, but a lot of it is just like the hourly wage of the person answering the phone.

(01:05:32):
So if an AI agent can take that call and solve it, that is in the industry often called a call deflection or a containment. And that essentially means you saved, call it $15 because you didn't have to have someone pick up the phone. So in our industry, basically we say, "Hey, if the AI agent solves the customer's problem, they're happy with it and you didn't have to pick up the phone," there's a pre-negotiated rate for that and we call it resolution based. There are other outcomes as well. We have some sales agents being paid a sales commission, believe it or not. We do. We really think of our agents as truly customer experience like the concierge for your brand and we want to make sure that our business model is aligned with our customer's business model.

(01:06:22):
As you said, these agents need to be autonomous and the outcome has to be measurable. That's not always possible, but I think it's broadly possible. And what's really neat about it is if you talk to any CFO or head of procurement with their big vendors, they look at the bill of materials and it's overwhelming and it's impossible to know if you're getting the value that you hoped from that contract. I think consumption based, which was popular particularly in the infrastructure space is closer to it. But I'm not sure a token is actually a good measure of value from AI either. I always use the analogy, like right now, most of the coding agents are priced per token or per utilization, but there's this famous story of an Apple engineer who had a bad manager who's like had you report how many lines of code you wrote every day? Which every engineer in the world knows is an idiotic way to measure productivity.

(01:07:16):
He famously went in with a report that had a negative number because I think he did a big refactoring, deleted a bunch and it was his way of saying like, fuck you to the man. I think tokens are similar. Yeah, you used a lot of tokens, like good for you, did it produce a pull request that was good? And I think that's the whole point of all this. I think there's a huge difference between outcomes-based pricing and usage based pricing because especially in AI, they're not necessarily even correlated and you could have a long phone call and not solve the customer's problem and they give you a negative review online and call the call center again, all that effort was for nothing. In fact, you might've added negative value. And so, I am a huge believer in this.

(01:07:58):
And what's fun about it is it really just aligns... I think every technology company aspires to be a partner, not a vendor. And I think at Sierra, we are truly a partner to every single one of our customers because we're all aligned on what we want to achieve. And I think that is really where the software industry should go. It requires a lot of different shape of a company. You have to be able to help your customers achieve those outcomes. You can't just throw software at the wall because you'll never get paid if it doesn't. Your orientation becomes so extremely customer-centric when you do this the right way. I think it's just a better version of the software industry. So I think it's right from first principles, it's right for procurement partners and I think it's right for the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:43):
We've been chatting a little bit about productivity gains. There's a lot of skepticism in the headlines these days of just like what is AI actually doing? Is it actually helping people be more productive? There was a recent study actually, I don't know if you saw, where they showed engineers were less productive with AI because it was just putting them in different directions. They had to research all what's going wrong here? So I think CX is a really good example where you clearly are seeing gains. Are you seeing actual gains at your company or any other company you work with outside of CX in terms of productivity that is like clearly yes, this is working and a huge deal?

Bret Taylor (01:09:15):
I'm extremely bullish on the productivity gains from AI, but I do think the tools and products right now are somewhat immature and it's quite counterintuitive. So, for example, almost every software engineering firm I know uses something like Cursor to help their software engineers. Most people use Cursor right now as a coding autocomplete, though they have a lot of agentic solutions and there's a lot of... OpenAI has Codex and Cloud has... I can't remember the Anthropic products. So there's lots of agentic agents coming as well. One of the interesting things because the technology is immature, the code it produces often has problems. There's a lot of people approaching this to actually realize those productivity gains because as any engineer who's written a lot of code will tell you, it's pretty easy to look at and edit and fix code you wrote.

(01:10:10):
Reviewing other people's code or particularly finding a subtle logical error in someone else's code is actually really hard. It's actually much harder than editing code that you wrote yourself. So if the code produced by a coding agent is often incorrect, it actually can take a lot of cognitive load and time to fix it. And in fact, if you end up producing lots of issues with your customers, you could end up producing a lot of features, but actually, is like mucking up the machine a little bit and having something that's not ideal. There's a couple of techniques that I think are interesting. First, I think there's a lot of AI starts now working on things like code reviews. I think this idea of self-reflection in agents is really important. Having AI supervise the AI is actually very effective. Just think about it this way, if you produce an AI agent that's right 90% of the time, that's not that great, but how hard would it be to make another AI agent to find the errors the other 10% of the time? That might be a tractable problem.

(01:11:10):
And if that thing's right 90% of the time, just for argument's sake, you can wire those things together and have something that's right 99% of the time. So it's just a math problem and it turns out that you can make something to generate code, you can make something to review code and you're essentially using compute for cognitive capacity and you can layer on more layers of cognition and thinking and reasoning and produce things increasingly robust. So I'm very excited about that. The other thing though is root cause analysis. So we have an engineer at Sierra who exclusively focuses on the model context protocol server serving our cursor instance. And our whole philosophy is, if cursor generated something incorrect, rather than just fixing it, try to root cause it. Try to get it so the next time Cursor will produce the correct code and essentially, is context engineering.

(01:12:05):
What context did Cursor not have that would've been necessary to produce the right outcome? So I think people who are trying to get productivity gains in departments like software engineering need to stop waiting for the models to magically work if they want to see the gains now. And you really have to create root cause analysis and systems and say, how do we go root cause every bad line of code and actually give the right context and produce the right system so the models can do it today? Over time that'll probably be less necessary and you'll have less context engineering necessary to do it, but you really have to think of this as a system and I think people are waiting for the models to just magically get better. And I'm like, well that will happen eventually, but if you want the gains now you got to put in the work. That's essentially why applied AI companies exist.

(01:12:53):
And the work is non-trivial, but you can do it. And so, for customers using platforms like Sierra, yeah, AI agents aren't perfect, but we're creating a system that lets customers create a virtuous cycle of improvement. If you want to go from a 65% automated resolution rate to 75%, we have a billion tools to let AI help you do that, identify opportunities for improvement, figure out why people are frustrated, what new capabilities can we add to our agent to improve the resolution rate? And you let AI put the needles at the top of the haystack on your behalf and I think that's really the way to optimize these systems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):
I've never heard of this technique of improving Cursor by adding additional context. What's the actual way of doing that? You build an MCP server that everything runs through or is it like you add Cursor rules? What's the actual approach there?

Bret Taylor (01:13:41):
I'm probably out of my depth here, but it's essentially MCP because that's how you provide context to Cursor. And I think that almost always when you have a model making a poor decision, if it's a good model, it's lack of context. And so, you really want to find the intersection of your particular product and code base with the context available to these coding agents and systems and fix it at the root is the principle here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:06):
Got it. That is very cool. I hadn't heard of people doing that, model context protocol, makes sense. We've talked about productivity gains outside TX. Just to give you a chance to share how amazing what you've built is, what are some of the gains you see from people using Sierra?

Bret Taylor (01:14:18):
Yeah, our customers see anywhere between 50 and 90% of their customer service interactions completely automated, which I think is really exciting. And we serve just a really, really broad range of customers. We serve the health insurance industry, the healthcare provider space, banks. You can actually refinance your home using an agent. One of our customers built on our platform to the telecommunications industry, DIRECTV, SiriusXM to a lot of retailers as well, which is really fun. Everyone from Wayfair to clothing retailers like OluKai and Chubbies Shorts. What's really neat about it is it's a pretty diverse range of use cases and it's everything from helping you sign up for... We have an agent that helps with customer support in one of the big dating applications to helping you upgrade or downgrade your SiriusXM plan. Actually, it's really funny, we do technical support from everything from home alarm systems to sonar speakers to more recently, CAT scan machines, which I think is amazing.

(01:15:28):
So technicians going in and fixing the CAT scan machine can chat with an AI agent to help them guide them through that process. We're the leader in the space, we're trying to enable every company in the world to create their agent with their brand at the top that I think will become as meaningful of a digital touch point as their website or their mobile app. In the short term, it can really transform the costs of running a customer service team. And what's remarkable is do so with really high customer satisfaction scores. That Weight Watchers agent, I believe has a customer satisfaction score of 4.6 out of five, which is pretty amazing. And what's interesting about service too, it's often people having a problem. And so, when you have a clear, I don't know if you use them in the airport, I think that agent has a CSAT score of 4.7 out of five people are coming in with a problem and [inaudible 01:16:19] delighted. And I think that's really the opportunity here.

(01:16:22):
And our whole vision is that we're going to move towards a world where every single one of the interactions with your customers can be instant. It can be multilingual, it can be over audio, it can be over chat, it can be digital, it can be over the phone and it can be very personalized. And I think that's really, really exciting. And if you think about all the best moments you've had with a brand, it's like that store associate who you know, and it's like for me, it's like the butcher at the grocery store. I love to cook, he knows me. We talk. Can you actually produce that at scale for a company with 100 million customers and can you do it in a really personal way? And I think we're really on the cusp of enabling that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):
Let me ask you one more question before we get to a very exciting lighting round. There's a lot of founders struggling with go-to-market in AI with their AI apps. There's so many apps these days, so many products, so many things coming at buyers, at large B2B companies. Clearly you guys have figured something out. I imagine your name helps, investors help, but what have you learned about just how to successfully do go-to-market with an AI product, say an agent-specific product that you think would be helpful for folks trying to do this better?

Bret Taylor (01:17:35):
I think there's a small handful of go-to-market models that have been proven to work, and I think it's important to choose the right one for the product category you're going after. One category I would say is developer-led. This is somewhere famously Stripe and Twilio where probably two of the original that did this exceptionally. And essentially, the go-to-market motion there is to appeal to an individual engineer often within the department of the CTO who have accountability and a fair amount of latitude to choose a solution. This works if your product is a platform product. It doesn't work, for example, if your product is trying to help a line of business because lines of business typically don't have dedicated engineering teams or let alone, the latitude to just go download a new library or start using a web service like that. It particularly works well if you sell to startups just because startups tend to have engineering teams with quite a bit of latitude to choose services to help them solve the problem given by the founder.

(01:18:44):
Then there's product-led growth. It's a broad term, obviously every company's product matters, but product-led growth more specifically means users can sign up from the website, often get put on a trial. Often you can buy a couple of seats with a credit card and those work where your user and your buyer are the same person. So it works for small business software almost always because sole proprietors do everything. And so you're selling small business software like Shopify in the early days and there's a lot of other products like that where you're trying to sell to small merchants. That's great. It doesn't work well when your buyer and the user of the software are different. So I'll use the example of something like expense reporting software. The user of that software is an individual employee, but the buyer is often a finance department. And so having sign up and buy with your credit card doesn't make sense because the person using is not the person with the credit card and it just doesn't work.

(01:19:39):
And then there's direct sales. And direct sales had gone, I don't want to say out of fashion, but if I think of the best direct sales companies, probably there's a lot of lineage from Oracle, but you think SAP, Oracle, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Adobe perhaps, and there's others as well. And these were companies that sold into large lines of business in a relatively traditional sales motion. I think because product-led growth became very popular. I think a lot companies use that, which is great, that motion produces great products, but if PLG means that you aren't actually engaging with the buyer of your software, you're not going to grow. And so, I've actually seen more recently, with a lot of AI companies, direct sales come a little bit more back into fashion because I think so many of the opportunities in AI actually meet that qualification where the buyer and the user are not necessarily the same person and it really requires that go-to-market motion.

(01:20:40):
Where I see entrepreneurs stumble is they'll choose a go-to-market motion without thinking through what is the process of purchasing this software? What is the process of evaluating the value of this software? And I think people just need to be much more first principles about it and much more thoughtful about it. And candidly, I think a lot of companies should leverage direct sales more than they do. And even though because of the sometimes justified reputation of the quality of products of some of these direct sales companies, it had gotten a bad name. And I think I'm thankful to see it coming back in a lot of the AI market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):
I feel like this message is something a lot of founders need to hear, especially founders that aren't from a business background that sales turns them off, they don't think they're going to be great at sales. Just this push of this might be what you have to get really good at and this is how you win and you can't just rely on product like growth.

Bret Taylor (01:21:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:38):
Bret, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any last nugget of wisdom? Anything you want to double click on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Bret Taylor (01:21:47):
No, go ahead.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:48):
Okay, let's do it. Here we go. Welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Bret Taylor (01:21:53):
Yeah, go ahead.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:54):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Bret Taylor (01:21:59):
I don't read a lot of nonfiction, but probably if I had to pick one in the area of the topics we talked about, Competing Against Luck, which was the book that produced Jobs to be Done, which is a framework I really believe in. My only critique is I think most of these business books should be like an article. So maybe buy the book and punch it into ChatGPT and get the summary. But buy the book it's Clayton Christensen talked about it, but it's a really good framework for thinking about delivering value with your products. And I think it definitely influenced me.

(01:22:37):
Actually one book I do recommend is Endurance, which is the story of Shackleton's trip to go to the South Pole. Half the book is him starving to death and eating seal meat with his crew of people frozen in their boat. I've never seen a better story of grit in my entire life. It's remarkable that it's a true story and if you're an entrepreneur going through a hard time, read that, you'd be like, okay, it could be worse. It's a great book too. It's just remarkable that it's a true story.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:08):
And one thing he did a great job at is setting expectations for folks that joined that famous newspaper-

Bret Taylor (01:23:13):
That ad. That newspaper ad. I don't know if that's true. It's remarkable if that's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):
Oh, it might not be true.

Bret Taylor (01:23:17):
I don't know. The internet. Who knows?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:20):
Goddam. Deep fakes even back then. Okay. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Bret Taylor (01:23:27):
I haven't gone to any new TV shows recently? We just watched Inception with the kids and they loved it and made me appreciate Christopher Nolan and what a cool movie. It's the type of movie when you watch the film and you can a conversations for two days afterwards about it. So, just a great film.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):
I saw someone using I think VO 3 to create their own Inception videos where the worlds wrapping in on each other. Oh, man. Okay. Do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you love or one you've loved for a long time?

Bret Taylor (01:23:59):
I'm really a big fan of Cursor. I think it's changed. I love creating software and I'm excited though for agents. I've been really excited. I was very excited to see Codex from OpenAI and others. So I think Cursor will be in its current form, is a transition product. And I know they're working on agents as well, but I really enjoyed taking something I love and it's been my life's passion and really diving into this AI tool and seeing how it transforms how I create software. So I've just been spending a lot of time with the product just because it's so core to what I love to do and it's a really well crafted product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:39):
I think that's the first time someone's actually mentioned Cursor in this answer, so might be the beginning of a trend. Michael Trell was on the podcast and he actually had a very similar message as you had at the beginning of this chat about the future of code, what comes after code and this concept that there's going to be this additional pseudo code layer on top of code. Very aligned with your thinking. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Bret Taylor (01:25:05):
The best way to predict the future is to invent it, which I think I attribute to Alan Kay of Xerox PARC. He invented a lot of the core abstractions that we use in computing today. I'm an entrepreneur, it's why I love to build things and it's definitely a life motto for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:29):
I feel like many people say this, I feel like you've actually done this so many times. You're really living this motto. Final question. We talked about you inventing the like button at FriendFeed. Were there other thoughts of what they would call it other than like? Was it just obviously like? Or was there other thinking there?

Bret Taylor (01:25:48):
This was before emoji. So, if you read the comments on FriendFeed posts, at least 70% of them are cool or wow or yeah or neat. And one of the principle uses of FriendFeed was to have discussions about things. So you'd have a post and then a pretty fulsome discussion underneath. And compared to Twitter and others, it was a great place to have those discussions. And so, the product problem we were trying to solve is get all the one word answers out so that the discussion was actually actual comments as opposed to acknowledgements that you read the thing.

(01:26:30):
So, the original framing was one click comment. That was how we thought about it. And so, the first version that I made had a heart, and she denies remembering this, but Anna Yang, now Anna Muller who has worked at the company, she hated it. She said, "If I look at hearts on every post, I'm going to vomit. It's too much." And it also was interesting, we were simulating, it was like an article about a tragedy or something. A heart was just not the right thing. Like which actually turned out to be really hard to translate was just a much more neutral sentiment, and that's why it was hard to translate because it was subtle. So that's how we ended up with this.

(01:27:17):
We started with a heart, and I don't know if we ever heard the word love, but we definitely started off with the iconography and then like, which just felt like this positive yet as neutral as possible within the realm of positive so that it could work for a more complex story. But it was all because we needed a one-click comment. That's where the concept came from.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
Wow. I've never heard the story before. It makes me think about LinkedIn now. They're basically trying to solve that same problem. They have all these auto-reply pill tag things. I don't think people like those very much.

Bret Taylor (01:27:37):
Yeah. They have a lot of features.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):
So many AI features. Bret, this was incredible. This was an honor. I so appreciate you coming on this podcast. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe go see if they want to work at Sierra and how can listeners be useful to you?

Bret Taylor (01:28:00):
If you want an AI agent to help with customer service, go to sierra.ai. If you want to apply here, sierra.ai/careers where we have offices in San Francisco and New York, Atlanta and London and are hiring pretty aggressively in every department. So please reach out if you're interested.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):
And how can listeners be useful to you? Is it tryout Sierra, anything else there?

Bret Taylor (01:28:21):
Yeah, tryout Sierra. I'm a single issue voter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:26):
[inaudible 01:28:26] message. I love it.

Bret Taylor (01:28:26):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:27):

# Why ChatGPT will be the next big growth channel (and how to capitalize on it) | Brian Balfour

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Everyone's always complaining SEO's dead, it can't grow. Word of mouth is so hard. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:03):
All of the ingredients for new distribution platform are essentially happening. My prediction, the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT. There's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
This is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:16):
It ends up being a prisoner's dilemma. Don't trick yourself into thinking that you can't play the game. The cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time. If you don't do it, your competitors are going to go to the new platform and your customer expectations change. There is no opting out of the game. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
This is the opportunity to disrupt an incumbent. 

Brian Balfour (00:00:33):
If you're a late-stage company, you place multiple bets. For startups, it's a totally different ballgame. You have to choose one and go all in. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
Think about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies.

Brian Balfour (00:00:43):
Building a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient. And actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
What would be the backup if not ChatGPT? 

Brian Balfour (00:00:54):
My hypothesis of who's best-positioned would actually be...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):
Today, my guest is Brian Balfour. Brian is the founder and CEO of Reforge, a company that I've been a long-time fan and advocate of. Historically, Reforge has focused primarily on teaching courses on product and growth, but more recently they've transitioned to building their own products, including a product called Reforge Insights and a bunch more really cool stuff coming very soon. 

(00:01:18):
Prior to Reforge, Brian led growth at HubSpot, and over the course of his career, he has seen the rise and fall of every major distribution channel, including Facebook's ad platform, Google Ads and SEO, and the Apple App Store. Based on what he's seeing, he is predicting the emergence of a brand new and powerful distribution channel that will likely arise in the next six months, centered most likely around ChatGPT. It is really rare for a new growth channel to open up. It's been a long time since the last one appeared, and the people who recognize this and hop on it early are the ones that reap the most rewards. So this is a huge deal. 

(00:01:54):
In this conversation, Brian shares what he's predicting, what he's seeing, why this is a big deal, and what you should be doing about it right now. I highly recommend you listen to this full conversation and discuss the ramifications with your team.

Today's episode is brought to you by DX, the developer intelligence platform designed by leading researchers. To thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly, but many organization leaders struggle to answer pressing questions like which tools are working? How are they being used? What's actually driving value? DX provides the data and insights that leaders need to navigate this shift. With DX, companies like Dropbox, Booking.com, Adyen, and Intercom get a deep understanding of how AI is providing value to their developers and what impact AI is having on engineering productivity.

This episode is brought to you by Basecamp. Basecamp is the famously straightforward project management system from 37signals. Most project management systems are either inadequate or frustratingly complex, but Basecamp is refreshingly clear. It's simple to get started, easy to organize, and Basecamp's visual tools help you see exactly what everyone is working on and how all work is progressing. Keep all your files and conversations about projects directly connected to the projects themselves so that you always know where stuff is and you're not constantly switching contexts. Running a business is hard. Managing your project should be easy. I've been a long-time fan of what 37signals has been up to and I'm really excited to be sharing this with you. Sign up for a free account at basecamp.com/lenny. Get somewhere with Basecamp. Brian, thank you so much for being here and welcome back to the podcast. 

Brian Balfour (00:04:09):
Yeah, thanks for having me. Excited for this one. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:12):
I'm really excited to have you back. We're just going to dive right in. Essentially, you've uncovered a really important trend or insight about how products are going to grow differently in the future, how growth is changing, and this is something that I think a lot of people need to hear, so I asked you to come on to share what you're seeing. I also think this is just very timely. I think you said you're going to say in the next six months things might significantly change, so I'm really excited to do this. We're going to spend this whole conversation on this insight. To set us up, what is just the big idea? What's the high-level idea here? 

Brian Balfour (00:04:45):
Just like you, I've spent my whole career just really passionate about startups, figuring out how to build products that win, that emerge in new markets, and one of the things that I have learned over time or one of the things you hear a lot from a lot of folks is, to win, you have to really build a great product. A lot of advice boils down to that. And one of the things that I feel like I've banged my head against the wall in a lot of ways in my career is actually telling people that building a great product is one of those things that's necessary, but not sufficient, and actually the separation is between those that build really great distribution. 

(00:05:26):
So this general partner, his name's Alex Rampell, he's at Andreessen Horowitz, actually wrote this blog post 10 years ago back in I think 2015. In the essence of the blog post, he basically says one thing, which is that startups is a game of trying to get distribution before the incumbent can copy. It's this kind of concept of escape philosophy. 

(00:05:54):
On that note, which I think os a very good summary of what you're trying to do in a startup and distribution, is that we're right now living in this environment where that game of startups getting distribution faster than the incumbent has gotten way harder in a lot of ways, and in some small cases has gotten a little bit easier. But if we think about this, the way that it's gotten harder and some of the things that probably a lot of founders or folks working on the growth side that probably feel is that, one is that incumbents can copy faster these days. That window that you have to get that escape velocity has actually shrunk. It's decreased. 

(00:06:34):
The second thing is that a lot of the organic distribution that we've had, especially over the past few years, has really shrunk as well. Everybody's talking about the decline of SEO and clicks declining, but you also see it in some other cases. A lot of these social platforms don't really let you send as much traffic to sites. LinkedIn just changed their algorithm, which has really dropped organic distribution. Obviously the Twitter-to-X, transition that happened, right? TikTok's almost always been like that.

(00:07:06):
And then the third way that it's gotten harder is that AI's really good at writing software and code generation, and so everybody's feeling this infinite increase of competition, especially at the startup level. YC is pumping out six of the same thing every single cohort. That's what it literally feels like. 

(00:07:23):
So it's gotten way harder. This game, this escape velocity game has gotten a lot harder. It's gotten easier in some very exceptional cases like the Cursor or something where AI has been like the spark. I know you wrote the blog post about the race car engine, and I think you said there's the spark plug in the engine. AI really created that, a new type of spark, a new type of interest of early adopters to fuel some new players in a short period of time. So it's amazing to see something like Cursor overtake market share of something like GitHub Copilot in nine months or less. That's how fast it happens. It's kind of crazy. 

(00:08:01):
But the main thing that people need to understand is, okay, well, if that's the game I'm playing, how to get to escape velocity before the incumbent? What are all the ways to do that and to really figure that out? There's multiple ways that this can happen, but one of the major ways, one of the major, major ways that we always see is that this can happen when new distribution platforms emerge, because when new distribution platforms emerge, startups are usually the fastest to take advantage of them. It's slower for the incumbents to move. It gives startups this opportunity essentially to play this game. 

(00:08:39):
Casey Winters wrote this blog post about two years ago, maybe 18 months ago, about the AI technology shift. His key point was the AI technology shift has been a technology shift that has not come with a distribution shift yet. If you look historically, we've had a bunch of technology shifts from the internet to the cloud to mobile to social, all of these different types of things. Some of them come with new distribution platforms, new ways to distribute products, and some of them don't, but the most powerful ones, the most impactful ones are the ones that do come with these new distribution platforms. His second key point was that these two things don't actually happen at once. Usually you get the technology shift, then you get the distribution shift a little bit later. 

(00:09:25):
Now we're a couple years from that post. We are a couple years into AI technology shift, and one of the things that I am seeing is all of the conditions, all of the ingredients for a new distribution platform to emerge are essentially happening. So I think we're at an inflection point where we're going to see this emerge really fast. 

(00:09:45):
The key thing for everybody to know is that as new distribution platforms emerge, they follow the same four-step cycle and it's a game that you're playing, that everybody's playing. Just like any game, you need to know the rules of the game. You need to know the steps of the game in order to have any sort of opportunity to win. That's the thing that I've lived through once again, both painfully and also in good ways, and is something that I'm keeping my eye on and something that I've been talking about. Before we go into that four-step cycle, I figured I'll pause there to see if you have any follow-up questions on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Okay. This is amazing. Essentially what you're saying is we follow these ways to grow, there's SEO, there's paid growth, there's sales. All these channels have been around for a long time. They're extremely saturated. Everyone's always complaining SEO's dead, it can't grow, the SEO, anymore. It can't grow. Word of mouth is so hard, there's so many amazing things now that's hard. Paid is so hard. It's just all this money just-

Brian Balfour (00:10:24):
Tax are rising.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):
Exactly.

Brian Balfour (00:10:49):
All these things. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
So all these saturated channels, and what you're saying is there's an emerging new channel that has not yet been saturated, and this is a huge opportunity for companies to get on it. And you'll talk about timing because it's a little tricky to even know exactly when to go big on this.

Brian Balfour (00:11:05):
That's right. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:06):
But that's a huge deal. This has been a long time since there's a new way to grow that you can actually use as a lever for growth and not just hope for the best. Okay.

Brian Balfour (00:11:15):
Yeah. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):
Before you get into the cycles, do you want to tease what the answer is, just to give people a little hint, or do you want to keep it secret?

Brian Balfour (00:11:23):
Well, to be clear, okay, so my prediction, we don't have a clear winner yet. My prediction of the new distribution platform will be ChatGPT, in some ways that people probably already think it's happening in some ways that it won't, but the thing that is less important or that is more important than whether I have predicted the exact winner correctly, the thing that's more important is to understand the cycle and evaluate how to determine where you want to place your bets and how to place those bets, which I know we'll talk about.

(00:12:02):
I could be wrong about the ChatGPT prediction and what's going to happen there. I think there's going to be two parts of it. There's going to be what they do with a ChatGPT search experience, but I think the bigger thing will be whatever they do with launching a third-party platform on top of ChatGPT, there's a bunch of signals that they're about to launch that, I'm pretty sure it's going to be ChatGPT. 

(00:12:25):
The thing I'm way more sure about is that some new distribution platform will emerge and it will follow the same four-step cycle. That's the key. Could be wrong on the first piece, I am very confident on the second piece.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:40):
Okay. Excellent foreshadowing. I completely agree, if it's anything, it would be ChatGPT at this point. Let's get into it. What are the cycles that platforms generally follow? 

Brian Balfour (00:12:49):
Yeah, and I'll give some examples of this, but let me explain the four steps of the cycle first and then we'll go through a bunch of examples of all those individual steps. The four steps are essentially, one is I call a Step Zero. It's the conditions of the market have been met. Step One is about a moat, Step Two is about a platform opening, and Step Three is about the platform closing for control and monetization. Let me briefly explain each one. 

(00:13:20):
Step Zero is about the competitive market being met, the conditions being met, and there's a few part piece of this. One is that typically what happens is that there is consensus that there is going to be this new huge category. Think social, think mobile, like all those types of things. In this case, these AI like chat platforms, like a ChatGPT or a clock. There's consensus about that, but there's no clear winner yet. We typically have somewhere between five to seven major players really battling it out and they're all looking for what is the edge? What is the thing that is going to help me win? Because all of these dynamics, in all the history, they either end up in monopolies or duopolies, and so the stakes are really large and so the competition is fierce. 

(00:14:13):
That's Step Zero. I think we could all agree that we are in that mode right now. We've got OpenAI battling with Claude, battling with Gemini, and Google with whatever Meta comes out with their new team, so on and so forth. There's huge amounts of capital, there's consensus, all the types. They are in a fierce composition. That's Step Zero.

(00:14:36):
Step One is then these players, somebody essentially identifies whatever the moat is, the thing that is going to help build them defensibility and help them hit escape velocity and become that monopoly or duopoly in that single category. Once they figure out what that moat is, then they need to press the advantage. They need to figure out how to gather that moat as fast as humanly possible. It tends to be that you can't do that by yourself, so you need the help of an ecosystem in order to gather more of that moat. 

(00:15:12):
That typically comes down to third-party content creators or app developers and other businesses. So they all establish a third-party platform that has some incentives built in, and usually the value exchange is, hey, you develop on top of my platform, you add more use cases, more engagement, all of these things to my platform, and in exchange, I'm going to give you something in return. Usually that thing that's in exchange is, I'm going to give you some new form of distribution for your application and for your business.

(00:15:48):
But what essentially happens over time is that we go into Step Three, which is the closing period, which is at some point, all of these companies end up starting to lock down the platform. This tends to happen for reasons of monetization and growth. They either competitively don't want somebody to use their own platform to disrupt themselves. We saw that in the early Twitter days with things like Vine and Periscope, shutting those things down unceremoniously, or they need to find ways to monetize at a deeper and deeper level because all these companies, they have to grow. 

(00:16:32):
Google's the classic example here of just more and more real estate has either been taken up by either ads or their own first-party applications. That's the key is they close it down by doing by one of a few things. They either shut it down entirely, two, they develop their own first-party applications to absorb the highest use cases, or three, they artificially depress the organic distribution that they gave you in the step prior to push you towards paid mechanisms in order to monetize. I think we should go through multiple examples here, but that's the core essence of the four steps. I'll pause there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):
Awesome. So it's essentially figure out what's going to make, create defensibility long-term with your moat, bring everyone in, "Hey, everyone, welcome to Facebook," everyone joins Facebook and then, okay, and all the developers build on Facebook to bring in more people on Facebook and then they're like, "Okay, now you got to pay. There's a toll," but you love this so much and you're so hooked to all your friends that you're here, you may as well stick around. 

Brian Balfour (00:17:35):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:35):
Amazing. Okay, so yeah, a few examples would be great. 

Brian Balfour (00:17:38):
Yeah. You just hit on the first one. This is the first one that I always think about because this is where I learned about this cycle very early in my career. One of my first companies was during the Facebook platform boom, social gaming, all of those applications, and I lived the full cycle in a very short period. I lived the glory days and just the absolute horror days, and it was very painful, but this is exactly what happened. 

(00:18:06):
Let's go through the four steps. Step Zero. Facebook was in a brutal battle with MySpace, Friendster and a few others. People forget this. People forget that there was actually a bunch of competitors at that time, and in fact those competitors were bigger than Facebook. They had more users back in 2007 when Facebook launched their third-party platform. But one of the key things is that Facebook was very early to the insight about the direct network effects in that there's going to create real lock-in that the more friends, the more of the global network that was on there, the more that it was just going to feed and hit this escape velocity.

(00:18:44):
At the time they launched their platform, I think they were maybe one-fourth, one-fifth the size of something like MySpace or even Friendster, Orkut, these are some of the names at that time, but they opened up their third-party platform. What was the value exchange? They went to third-party developers and they said, "Okay, we've created this canvas," they used to call it the canvas, and they were like, "You can put anything in the canvas that you want: an app, a game, whatever. You can monetize in any way you want. We just want this sidebar real estate on the ads. That's what we're really interested in." There was this mad gold rush on that Facebook. 

(00:19:24):
Oh, sorry, the other part of that was, "Not only will you put it there, we're going to give you access to all of these notification channels and feed to get distribution for your application." That was the other piece of it. You had this mad rush of developers coming in and you had this huge social application, social gaming boom. People just grew incredibly virally very fast, but eventually, essentially what happened over time is they kept peeling back that value exchange. 

(00:19:52):
They first were like, "Ah, actually those dollars that you're making inside that canvas area, well, we want a percentage of that." So they changed that. And then they figured out their ad systems and then they started peeling back. They started suppressing access to all of the organic channels that they had. Eventually, they went all the way towards absorbing the highest use case into their own first-party platform, things like first-party applications, things like events, photos, all those types of things, and basically shut down the platform for dead. 

(00:20:30):
These companies that have basically built on top of this platform, the other thing is by the time they started closing all those things down, all those competitors that we talked about, they were so far ahead at that point because they had built off the back of all these developers coming, adding use cases, bringing more users onto the platform, identifying that moat. They were so far ahead, it didn't matter. It didn't matter what the other folks did at that point, and that's what really gives you confidence to start closing down. But there's so many other examples of this if we go through it. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
Just before you give other examples, just something I'll highlight here. One is the moat they identified in theory was the friend graph, I imagine?

Brian Balfour (00:21:02):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):
Just once we have all your friends, you're not going to want to go anywhere. I imagine it's also important to note, this is a natural thing that would happen if you build the thing and it grows and you're like, "Oh, maybe we should change strategy." I imagine not everyone even knows this is what will happen and they organically evolve their strategy, or do you think everyone's just like, "This is now going to be our plan, Step 1, 2, 3, 4?"

Brian Balfour (00:21:32):
I think a different version of that question is I think some people could sit here and interpret this as all these folks are evil. That's not what I'm saying. That's actually not what I'm saying. I want to be very clear on that, because I think this cycle happens because of competitive and capitalistic dynamics and pressures. It's the same environment that enables creating amazing new companies here in the US. 

(00:22:01):
And there's two sides of the coin. You go through this cycle because it's a competitive environment. You're trying to figure out how to beat competitors, and this is one of the strategies to beat competitors. But at some point you just have to continue growing. You have to grow those dollars. The market does not reward flat companies, if anybody's noticed. You have to keep growing, and so they have to keep finding ways to grow as well as prevent their own disruption. TThey can get so big and they can give access, so much access of distribution to new developers, they don't want to enable their own disruption as well as they need to keep growing. 

(00:22:38):
My guess is anybody who is sitting in their shoes owning their platform is going to follow the exact same playbook and the exact same reasoning. Look, sometimes it happens also because it actually is the best thing for the user. Facebook's channels did get super spammy and all of those things, and that was part of the reason they'd play this, but let's be honest, it wasn't the only reason. A lot of it was for these other reasons. I don't think it's evil. You just need to know how to play the game. That's competition, that's business. They're playing you, so you need to play them. That might be a little sadistic or something, but that is business. You're in a game of competition.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):
Essentially, the incentives are pointing you in this direction. Capitalism, they say capitalism works, and so it'll pull everyone in this direction even if maybe they want to avoid it. Let's do a couple more examples.

Brian Balfour (00:23:33):
Yeah, we'll go through them quick. I think everybody's probably... Google's an interesting one because it played out over a much longer period of time. Facebook happened over the course of about in five-ish years, something like that. Google did it very slowly over years, but same thing, early massive competition against Yahoo, I don't know, AltaVista, Lycos, you name them all. That was even before my time. They were first to really identify these data moats and incentivizing essentially web developers, content folks to optimize for their search algorithms, create this great distribution mechanism. Everybody's building content and everything for them, but over time, slowly but surely they did two things. 

(00:24:19):
One is more and more that real estate became ads that they were monetizing, so they're suppressing organic distribution in order to push people towards the ads, as well as absorbing a bunch of the highest value first-party use cases, things like travel as an example, or even restaurant search and all those types of things. The former Yelp CEO and founder has been out there saying a lot of things about these practices. So, same exact cycle.

(00:24:48):
Mobile went through the exact same cycle. iOS created a new distribution mechanism. They had a ton of competition among different phones when they first started on. They found the defensibility was more about the apps, the data and all the developers, created the App Store, all of these types of things, but over time, we've seen more and more restrictions there on that front. 

(00:25:09):
And then most recently, we've seen this happen in smaller places, too. LinkedIn, as an example, first went through this wave with company pages. They were like, "Ah, companies, come on, promote your company page. Bring in more users, all that type of stuff, and then get all these followers." And then of course you get almost no distribution now through your company page because they're pushing you towards ads. And then they recently just did this with personal profiles, too, which is they really boosted distribution for individuals to create content for that platform. They then introduced the thought leader ad format, a way to monetize those individual posts, and now you've seen them really pull back on that organic distribution. 

(00:25:52):
So this happens in big forms and it happens even in smaller use cases as well, but once again, the steps of the cycle are exactly the same. The key part about this, too, is that the broad trend is that the cycles seem to be getting shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter, so you actually have a smaller amount of time to play the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):
Okay, and the big a-ha here is, yes, this will end maybe not great for you, but there's this magical period when they're open to customers and users where you can grow like crazy because they want everyone to come and they give you a distribution. What you're saying essentially is ChatGPT, potentially some other platform, maybe is about to enter this moat.

Brian Balfour (00:26:35):
Yeah. Well, before we get to ChatGPT, I think the natural reaction when you first realize this is, "Screw them, I'm not playing that game." That's what I feel like most people, how they react. Because the unfortunate truth is that a lot of companies don't predict that last stage and end up in a really hard position. So many companies got completely killed during the crash of the Facebook social platform. Apple's 30% tax basically destroyed a bunch of types of applications and business models because you feel like it just wasn't margin-effective. So many companies built on SEO loops that are in serious, serious trouble right now if that's their only channel. So all these things. 

(00:27:33):
I think the natural reaction is, why would I play this game if I'm a startup or a company? You can even see this with ChatGPT, as an example. They just launched these deep research connectors. One of them was my former company, HubSpot. If you sat inside HubSpot and you were just thinking in isolation, you would be like, well, why would I want to make all of my data accessible through ChatGPT and have all of the usage you start to accrue there? That doesn't really make sense in isolation. But we don't operate in isolation. Once again, we operate in a competitive environment.

(00:28:11):
What's going to happen is that if you don't do it, your competitors are going to certainly go to the new platform and your customer expectations change, and you have to rise to those customers' expectations. They're going to start expecting you to be in these new experiences and all these things. It ends up being a prisoner's dilemma, which is, there is no opting out of the game. You have to play the game. So it's better to be early than to be super late to this game, especially, especially if you are a startup. That's the key opportunity. 

(00:28:51):
We will talk a little bit more about how to play the game more, but it's better to be early as well as, then the key, the harder part about it is anticipating that last stage of the cycle and figuring out how to sequence away from something before that last cycle comes. I think that's the key part, but let me pause there and then I'll talk a little bit about ChatGPT and some of my reasoning behind that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:12):
Cool. So what you're saying is not only is there going to be this big opportunity to grow, if you don't take advantage of it, somebody in your space will. It's not only there's an opportunity, but this is something you need to do because you might miss the boat. 

(00:29:26):
I think about companies like Zynga that grew on Facebook and then became massive companies. If they didn't do that, they would've missed the boat, someone else would've eaten that lunch. I don't know, I'm thinking about the Technology Bros podcast on Twitter right now, TBPN, where they basically figured out on Twitter you can create this livestream and you see it all day in your Twitter feed just like, hey, they're broadcasting, and it's a really cool distribution channel.

(00:29:49):
I think there's a big call to arms here almost of just the opportunities emerging and you basically need to pay attention. You can't opt out.

Brian Balfour (00:29:58):
That's right. That's right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:58):
Awesome. 

Brian Balfour (00:29:58):
Exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):
Okay, so let's talk ChatGPT.

Brian Balfour (00:30:02):
Look, let's go through this cycle. Right now we're in that competitive environment. Like we said, all those players we talked about, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, all these folks, they are battling it out. We've seen this with the Talent Awards especially over the past month or so. There's no clear winner yet, but there's consensus around the category. 

(00:30:25):
The second thing is then, okay, what's the moat? Has the moat been identified? And who seems to have identified it the first or as furthest along? My hypothesis, and I think there's a lot more consensus around this now than there might've even been three months ago, is that the moat is about context and memory. These models by themselves, if you compare them side by side, they generate the same result, and so the actual difference-maker is which one has more of your context, because it's the context plus the model that produces the best output, and then that starts to accrue to this loop around memory. The more you use it, the more it's able to store a memory around you, which feeds more personalized context, which produces better outputs. It ends up being another one of those flywheels, another one of those loops. 

(00:31:16):
If you look at who's farthest on this, it definitely is ChatGPT. They were the first ones to memory. They've been investing a lot in these different types of data connectors, essentially context connectors, gathering all of this context, so you can really start to see it in the usage. 

(00:31:37):
The second thing is, and one of the pushbacks I've gotten on my prediction has been, well, what about Google and Gemini? They have so much distribution through Chrome and all of this other stuff. Deedy Das, who's a VC at Menlo Ventures, actually published some good data on retention of all of these different ones. 

(00:32:00):
I think the second reason I predict ChatGPT is if you look at history once again, it was never the person who had the biggest distribution at the moment of time. It was the one that had the best retention and engagement. Google had the best retention and engagement over the others. Facebook was smaller, but had way better retention and engagement over the others, so on and so forth. 

(00:32:22):
The data that Deedy published clearly show that both the retention curves, which I know you and I have both written about at exhaustion, level off at significant portions higher than all the other platforms, as well as those retention curves have been shifting up dramatically over time, you can start to see the effects of memory. They have the very elusive smile curve, the ones that you just like. I've seen all of those dynamics very few times in my career, and they tend to be the folks like Slack and all of the big winners. It's just so elusive

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:04):
The smile curve, just to people who don't know what that is, is essentially retention goes up over time, it goes down a little bit, and then you come back to it and you use it more.

Brian Balfour (00:33:12):
Yeah, that's right, and it's usually the result of some type of network of factor or something else, and it's an early indicator that that platform is on a trajectory to hit escape velocity. 

(00:33:27):
The third piece is that, and they haven't really hidden these, but there's all sorts of signals that they're about to launch a third-party platform. They've been hiring for a bunch of roles. I've seen multiple postings on product manager engineering roles, all that kind of stuff for, quote, unquote, "agent platform" and all those pieces. It feels pretty inevitable that one of these players will need to launch a third-party platform in order to serve all the possible use cases on these tools. There's going to be some value exchange, which is like, hey, for your agent to be effective, you probably need access to the context and memory and distribution, so there'll be some value which is, "Integrate to us and we'll give you those three things which is going to drive more users and more usage," and we're going to go through the steps of the cycle. 

(00:34:21):
You can already see this. They're starting to form preferred partnerships with some of the bigger players, which paves the way for smaller third-party players. It lends credibility to the platform. It's like, well, if HubSpot and XYZ are doing it, then I should probably do it, too. It's like that type of mentality. But that's why I think out of all of these platforms, ChatGPT has the best shot right now. 

(00:34:47):
And then, a bunch of folks are always like, "Well, what about Claude? I really like Claude. I use Claude." Well, the problem with that is I think ChatGPT at this point has at least a 10x difference on MAU. If you're a developer and you're comparing those two platforms and you're looking at it and you're like, "Well, ChatPT has 10x the number of users and better retention engagement," it's like, what's the logical choice of which one you're going to prioritize your scarce resources on? 

(00:35:20):
Those are just some of the reasons that my prediction is on ChatGPT. In the blog post that I wrote about this, I actually then played my own devil's advocate and said, "Okay, here are some reasons why it might not be ChatGPT," but I think we're in that part of the cycle. That's my prediction. I might be wrong in the prediction of ChatGPT, but I really think, I feel very confident we're going to see this cycle play out again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):
Two follow-up questions here. One is, what would be the backup if it's not ChatGPT? It sounds like it might be Gemini or Google?

Brian Balfour (00:35:51):
My hypothesis of who's best-positioned but is not executing on it right now would actually be Apple-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):
Whoa.

Brian Balfour (00:35:59):
... because through the devices, they basically can see everything. They have the ultimate view into your context. They're sitting at that level But I don't know what they're doing. From an execution standpoint, maybe they're going to surprise us with something crazy magical, but we haven't seen any external signals around this. That's probably just based on what real estate and where people live in the stack would own. 

(00:36:34):
And then, I think right behind that, I would probably put Google because of owning the context of things like email and the distribution points of search and Chrome and Android and those types of pieces. A lot of people point to them, but my experience with all of their products, going back to the retention engagement thing, is that if we could take a look inside their metrics, I think what we would see is a bunch of fly-by users in their mouse. They're sprinkling the Gemini bucket everywhere. I've literally clicked on it accidentally multiple times. My guess is a huge portion of their mouse is exactly that of what's happening right now. Look, they just acquired a very talented team from Windsurf and from-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:30):
And just the team. Just the team, part of the team.

Brian Balfour (00:37:31):
Yeah. We'll see. Things are changing dramatically on a week-to-week basis, so we'll see if they're able to press those advantages in a very clear way. But I think the window is very small for them if ChatGPT plays their cards right, because they clearly have the escape velocity right now. If they just keep pressing that advantage in the right way, I think it's going to be very hard for Google to counter in the amount of time that's left

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:00):
On the Claude piece, I'll just throw this nugget out, I had Mike Krieger on the podcast, Head of Product, CPO, at Anthropic, and asked him just, "You're losing to ChatGPT. How do you approach the future of Claude?" He very specifically said, "Yes, they've caught lightning in a bottle. This is just going to win based on what I've seen at Instagram. So we are specifically focusing on what is Anthropic and Claude incredibly good at, which is developer tools, coding, backend stuff." So they're actually leaning more and more into that. If you've seen the revenue recently, they're making, I don't know, approaching 10 billion a year or some crazy amount of money. They're actually doing super well, just in a different use case.

Brian Balfour (00:38:40):
I'm glad you mentioned this because this brings up something that we skipped, which is, there are smaller platforms that have existed and will also emerge in this environment as well, and that's what you're alluding to. This tends to happen is things end up growing into more niches. Even if you look at social, like LinkedIn emerged as a subset of the social world, but even on these smaller platforms, these new distribution channels, they go through the same cycle. 

(00:39:12):
I'll give something, really a very opposite example of the ones that I gave. Look at the platform Udemy. They are a platform for course creators. I don't know if most people know this, but when they started, their rev share to creators was something like 80% to creators. They started very high. That brought on all the course creators, got their whole marketplace going, so on and so forth. I believe it was about a year ago they announced that they're essentially pushing that rev share down to somewhere between 15 and 20%. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:48):
Wow.

Brian Balfour (00:39:48):
They're somewhere at 25 and 30%. Another example of they close down organic distribution in order to monetize, all that kind of stuff. The same thing will happen in this AI world. Cursor, it's very clear Cursor's on the path to also probably create some type of agent platform for developers. That'll be a smaller ecosystem to play in for some products. It feels like everybody has the same strategy at this point is everybody wants to launch an agent platform. I imagine some of these other horizontal productivity tools will do the same thing, maybe like a Notion or an Airtable or a Monday.com or something like that. 

(00:40:31):
There will be smaller platforms that will emerge, and they will follow the exact same cycle that I'm also discussing, but in terms of the biggest consumer one, that's where I think ChatGPT has probably the most escape velocity and others will focus on different areas. Just to be clear, I love Claude. I actually use both Claude and ChatGPT-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:58):
Same.

Brian Balfour (00:40:59):
... for different things. I have lots of love to go around for all these tools. My prediction has no bearing on which product I like the most right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):
Also love Claude. So the key point here you're making is that there's almost a number of distribution channels emerging. Many of them will be niche. I think of LinkedIn. LinkedIn for me has a very targeted audience, for folks that listen to this podcast. Even though it's not, I don't know, Google or Facebook or whatever, it's still incredibly valuable for this specific thing that I do.

Brian Balfour (00:41:30):
For sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):
I think this is even more interesting that there's going to be a number of distribution channels that emerge out of this whole AI wave. 

(00:41:37):
The other thing I'll note real quick, you mentioned this idea of everyone's building agents. I just had Brett Taylor on the podcast who's building Sierra, and he made me realize why everyone's building agents partly. One is because the outcome-based pricing that you can charge with agents is incredible because, one, you can actually attribute their impact on your business's ROI. You can actually see this is saving an agent $15 because it solved the case. And it's attributable and it's autonomous. It's just doing it on its own. With that, you can charge per outcome. You can say, "We'll charge you a dollar," every time it solves an issue. So the monetization opportunity is huge and the margins go up like crazy.

Brian Balfour (00:42:19):
Can I just ask a question about that?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:21):
Yeah. 

Brian Balfour (00:42:22):
Do you think that has longevity in the sense that... That makes sense in the current environment that we're sitting in right now because people are comparing these outcomes relative to what it costs them today with pure humans. But once again, competition comes in at some point, and so that feels like that creates a pretty ripe opportunity to undercut and come into... and then you have the disruption theory playing out as well. It obviously depends on the infrastructure costs and compute costs to run these things, but I just wonder how much of that is temporary versus something that'll be long-term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:07):
So you're saying that dollar will come down to 50 cents, 25 cents, or you're saying someone's going to come with a whole new business model and disrupt that whole approach?

Brian Balfour (00:43:15):
More the first, yeah. It's just competition erodes that away, essentially, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:19):
Yeah, that's a good point. So margins will be higher for a while, and then they'll come down.

Brian Balfour (00:43:24):
Unless there's something else that creates a durable pricing power, right? 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:31):
Yeah. 

Brian Balfour (00:43:34):
That's probably the second piece of this. Yeah, that's probably the second piece of that hypothesis, I feel like. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:38):
Yeah. I guess the opportunity there, the moat would be the data, similar to how Cursor is collecting more feedback on what people want in their code suggestions, maybe in theory CRF and has more and more data over time, and there's this network effect-

Brian Balfour (00:43:53):
Yeah. That's right. Let me revise that. I believe in that as long as it's paired with-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:59):
Some moat?

Brian Balfour (00:44:00):
... this second piece. Otherwise, it gets competed away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):
Good tangent. Okay, one more question. What is your prediction on timeline for when the opportunity appears, and what do you predict, as of the day we're recording, what do you predict will be the next couple things that ChatGPT, and let's just focus on that, releases to start to open up this platform to get everyone in there?

Brian Balfour (00:44:26):
Well, look, I'll first give the disclaimer that I feel like any thoughts on timing in the AI market have been very hard to predict. It's always shorter. That's where we should buy us. It's always shorter than you think of when something's going to happen. That's what it's felt like from the seat that I've been sitting in. But my guess is this: we're going to see the next major steps of this play out over the next six months. 

(00:44:57):
I think we just saw one of the pieces drop around this, which was, ChatGPT's recently launched Agent mode. It's kind of a general-purpose agent, and I think that starts to introduce all of the users to using agents and they're figuring out and placing it in the different tiers and business models, all of those pieces. But it's likely that no general-purpose agent is going to fulfill all of the infinite use cases successfully. There's two reasons for this.

(00:45:30):
Users struggle with horizontal tools. They can do everything, and that's exactly why they struggle to adopt, and so they typically need more specific entry points. But also, the more specific use case you get, sometimes you need specific UI, specific data, other specific ingredients to properly fulfill that use case for a given audience. I think their Agent mode was a step in this direction. 

(00:45:56):
What I would expect to see play out next is that they will either launch, they will announce the platform with preferred partners, or what they're going to announce first is basically a set of preferred partners, the guinea pigs, an initial 10 to 20 folks that are bringing agents to their platform. What that does is essentially, once again, it's a credibility card. You do special deals with some brand names to give the platform credibility, and it creates this desire from everybody else to come on to the platform.

(00:46:37):
And then the step after that is starting to opening up the platform. This is where we'll really start to figure out what this game is going to look like because they basically have to define what the value exchange is. What are they giving you access to, and what are they incentivizing you with to come onto the platform? That's one version of it.

(00:46:58):
The other version of it is just the replacement to search. You can also see them starting to make more moves here, which is deeper attribution in some of the results, those types of pieces. They're bringing in shopping. That's one of their recent announcements as well, native into the UI. Essentially they will form new monetization mechanisms around that stuff as well. That's actually going to be very important because, going back to the moat around memory and context is that they will want to incentivize as many people to their free tier as possible, but given the cost of AI, they have to cover it somehow, so they're going to need some monetization mechanisms. The more that they can cover that free usage with things that aren't subscriptions, I think that probably also feeds the moat.

(00:47:51):
I think those are some of the next steps on two different vectors, more of a third-party developer platform and more of the content, whatever you want to call it, AEO, GEO. I don't know what acronym is we've all decided on yet. Let me know if we have. I think those will be the next steps that we'll see. 

(00:48:13):
Now, that's what I think for ChatGPT. I think the thing that we should talk about is, essentially what I would advise folks, especially startups, is you're placing bets. At this part of the cycle, you're placing bets. The winner is 100% guaranteed, as I mentioned, and so you essentially at some point will need to make some decisions about where to place your bets.

(00:48:37):
In the Facebook days, all those other social networks, they also came out with their own platforms. iOS had Android and some failed initiatives from Windows. I don't even remember what that platform was called. You can look back and whoever placed through... the iPhone was actually a very, and iOS is a good one, which is, if you had only aligned your bets to Android, you probably lost. If you somehow found a way to play on both ecosystems, you could be a winner. But if you only aligned to iOS, you could also be a winner. You had to have iOS as part of your betting strategy in order to win. 

(00:49:21):
Everybody right now, you're probably at this cycle and you're trying to figure out, well, everybody will need to figure out where are they going to place their chips. How are they going to bet? Depending on how you bet really depends on what your current position is in the marketplace. If you're a late-stage startup, let's start with that, or a late-stage company, you can afford the luxury to place multiple bets and spread your chips and wait it out a little bit to see who the winner is, and then really throw your muscle behind that winner. You have that luxury a little bit. But the risk of that, the risk of that is that sometimes the incumbents wait too long to make that decision, and that's the key question they will need to answer. 

(00:50:08):
The key question for startups is totally different. You don't have the luxury to spread your chips. You have to go all in. You have to choose one and go all in. You have scarce resources, scarce attention from the market. It's a totally different ballgame. Higher risk, higher reward, for sure. That's part of the betting strategy for startups. That's what you have to do is you have to figure out your betting strategy, and then we can talk a little bit about how you might evaluate and pick the right course for you. That's where we're all at right now is we just entered the casino, we just put some cash in for some chips, and now we've got to figure out what tables and where to place those chips.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:56):
I love this analogy. Just to be crystal clear about what listeners should do, what founders should do, what product teams should do, the advice here essentially is integrate with ChatGPT, maybe Gemini, maybe if Apple has something, actually integrate with what they launch. It could be a login thing, could be a search thing, could be a connect and suck up your memory in context. The advice here is you need to do this because this is potentially the way that most companies will start to grow and your competitors may overtake you.

Brian Balfour (00:51:30):
Yeah. If we had to really simplify it, it's essentially, play the game. Don't opt out of the game. Don't trick yourself into thinking that you can't play the game. That's number one. Number two, no matter who you bet on, just make it a focused bet. Because if you look back, all the failures are the ones that tried to play multiple games at once with scarce resources, and that just tends to never work if you're an early-stage startup. So those two things: play the game, put a focused bet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):

(00:53:14):
So you were Head of Growth at HubSpot for a long time, and you gave that as an example, HubSpot, why would they integrate, why would they give away all their data so that ChatGPT can suck it up, and you never have to go to HubSpot, you're just working through their agent. Would you at HubSpot be like, "Yes, we got to do this. This is the game we got to play"?

Brian Balfour (00:53:31):
Yeah, 100%, and that's exactly what I think you see them doing. Look, to be very clear, I have not talked to anybody at HubSpot about this. I have not talked to Dharmesh about this, but Dharmesh I think has also published about this. The right thing to do is, essentially, even though you understand how the cycle plays out and you don't necessarily understand what your exit strategy is once you get out, it's better to be early, know that you need to figure out an exit strategy and figure out that exit strategy along the way versus waiting and then being super late and then know what the exit strategy is. 

(00:54:15):
I think that's exactly what you see them doing. They're trying to be as early to this stuff as possible. I think it's a pretty smart play, even though we might not necessarily see what the exit strategy is out of this cycle for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:34):
Going back to that amazing quote that you shared at the beginning of the conversation by, I think it was Alex Rampell?

Brian Balfour (00:54:40):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:40):
Of that startups win by finding a distribution channel before the incumbent copies them. What you're saying here is this is the opportunity for startups to disrupt an incumbent. This is the opportunity for someone to disrupt Salesforce, I don't know, ServiceNow, all these guys that have been around for a long time.

Brian Balfour (00:54:59):
Yeah, it's going to be one of the major ones. Now look, you've already seen players that have been able to hit this escape velocity, the Cursors and stuff of the world. Once again, there's multiple ways to hit that escape velocity, but this is one of the major ways to do it is to basically hitch yourself to a new platform. Look, you did it yourself, actually. You hitched yourself to Substack super early. You took a focused bet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):
I was going to say that. 

Brian Balfour (00:55:28):
Yeah, yeah. I don't know why that just hit me, but you took a focused bet and you've benefited from it in a disproportional way than those that came later. I think that's actually a great meta example here as I sit here and think about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):
Yeah, that's actually the way I thought about when I was moving to Substack. I feel like there's this wave rising and I want to ride this wave, even if maybe it's not the best place or they take a cut, all that stuff. But it worked out really well. 

Brian Balfour (00:55:55):
That's right. I think it worked out very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:58):
It worked out really well. To be honest, it felt like it was too late when I started six years ago.

Brian Balfour (00:55:58):
It felt too late?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):
Yes.

Brian Balfour (00:56:06):
Oh, say more about that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:07):
It always feels too late, I think, to people that join... Silicon Valley, or sorry, Marc Andreessen has this famous quote. He's like, "I came to Silicon Valley in the '80s. I thought it was over, I was too late. I missed all the opportunities." That's fair. There was just a lot of newsletters. They were doing really well. Millions of subscribers. I'm like...

Brian Balfour (00:56:24):
And what do you say to people now who want to join Substack?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:27):
"Learn from this example." A lot of times when people think that it's too late, it's definitely not too late, and it's always only just getting started. Especially if you're on Twitter all day listening to podcasts like this where we're surrounded with this bubble of everyone talking about something, when in reality, 1% of people know anything about what you're hearing about every day.

Brian Balfour (00:56:45):
Yeah. Yeah, that's so interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:47):
Okay, so coming back to the advice, say someone is sitting there and talking to their manager like, "Brian just shared all this mind-blowing advice. We got to pick our battles, we got to pick our platform," what would your advice be for them to decide where to place their bets?

Brian Balfour (00:57:06):
I think this is a great question because, once again, put my personal prediction aside for a second, and I would encourage everybody to think about it from first principles from who their audience is, what their product is, what stage of company they're at, their current strengths and weaknesses, you got to take all this into account, but if I had to boil it down to a few criteria, the main things I would think about is, when you're looking at new distribution channels and new platforms to choose on, one, going back to what we said before is the better signal is retention and depth of engagement of the users on this platform than it is pure user level like MAU or some other number of signups, one of those vanity metrics. Look at that number one. 

(00:57:51):
Number two is, there's some element of user quality and ability to monetize the users on this platform. I think the starkest example here would be iOS and Android. Even today it's something like Android has 70-some percent of devices, but only 30% of the market share by dollars, and it's the exact flip for iOS. It goes back to what we were talking about earlier, which was, if you bet on Android only, you probably lost, but if you bet on iOS only, even though smaller user base, you were still able to parlay that into a win later. 

(00:58:31):
The third thing to look at is, as these platforms emerge, just analyze what the value exchange is. What are they giving you to incentivize you to develop on their platform? All these platforms, it's a bit of a game of whoever understands the rules and how to arbitrage the rules the best tend to be the ones with the edge and figure that out.

(00:58:58):
And then finally, fourth on my criteria would be pure scale. Obviously, even if you have those other three, but there's a 200x difference in scale and momentum, obviously you probably have to choose the bigger platform. 

(00:59:20):
But last but not least is as you go through these criteria, these are how you think through entering the game. Once you enter the game, then you immediately need to move to starting to think about how do you exit the game. Knowing once again that that last step is going to come at some point in the future, that there's going to be some closure for monetization, then that's where you have to start thinking through your strategy to exit. 

(00:59:47):
That comes down to things like, okay, well how are you going to own an important part of the user experience or workflow? Or how are you going to accumulate specialized data in context that the major platforms don't have? Or how do you create different types of micro network effects? All of these types of things. So just once again, there is the entrance criteria, but once you figure that out and you feel like you're in the game, you immediately need to move towards, okay, what's my exit plan here, knowing this is all coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):
It's interesting that another way to think about this model you've described as building, the strategy of building on top of LLMs and becoming a GPT wrapper. Because essentially this tech allows you to, say, create a cursor that is incredible, and then you could argue, oh, you're just going to be this wrapper, and they're getting all the money here, everyone can copy you. What's your defensibility long-term? The answer is, what is the moat you will build over time sitting on top of this thing that will make you more and more valuable on term and not have to rely on this thing? It feels like you could use the same framework for building a GPT wrapper business, to use that euphemism.

Brian Balfour (01:01:02):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:04):
Say someone is sitting there today. Is there anything they can do to start making a bet? Is it simply creating an MCP that allows LLMs to suck in your data? Is that the one thing you could do today? Is there anything else that's available today to start using these platforms, or is it just a little too early and they haven't released the good stuff yet? 

Brian Balfour (01:01:25):
It might be just a tad too early. We're right on that edge. Some of the questions I'm asking myself is, I'm going through all of these players and where our customers and target audience live, and I'm asking myself the question, okay, if this player launched some type of platform, how would we evaluate it? So on and so forth. 

(01:01:51):
You can also try to cozy up to these folks. I would place a large portion of my net worth right now that if we could sit in the OpenAI offices at that front desk, that they are having meetings with potential preferred developers talking about this, we could probably sit there and log it. I do think some people are going to be in a place to develop preferred relationships and make a note. If you're in that spot, then you should definitely play that card. A lot of early-stage startups will be in that place.

(01:02:30):
Other than that, I would say, once they launch these platforms, you can't do much else, so you really know what the value exchange is and what they're going to expose for you, but also just be prepared to turn your strategy on a dime and go all in. I think that's probably one of the hardest parts of this is that these things emerge and you have to capitalize extremely quickly. A lot of times, it's hard for leaders to do that because they don't want to create a feeling of whiplash into the unknown, and we've got all these projects in play. You know all the things. I think that's probably the last part of what we can be doing right now versus just staying on top of everything as it emerges.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:14):
As you were talking, this reminded me, I recently noticed that ChatGPT is driving me to my newsletter more traffic than Twitter, and I feel like that recently shifted. I didn't even know this was a thing until I just started looking through my referrals. I'm like, "ChatGPT? What the hell is going on there?" It's like a different version of what you're talking about, but essentially, in theory I could block ChatGPT from... I don't know. I don't even know if I can from... including all my stuff. 

Brian Balfour (01:03:39):
You can in Substack now, yeah. I just saw that setting in there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):
Okay. Oh, interesting. That's the similar kind of decision is, is it better for me for it to be recommending my stuff and telling people, "Hey, go check this thing out," or is it better to block it off? I think, per your point, and this is the way I felt, take it all. It's good. In that, it's better that it's from Lenny's newsletter than something else. So someone else will come in and eat that market share.

Brian Balfour (01:04:06):
Yeah, that's right. If you don't do it, somebody else is. I think that's also what all the major media publishers are really contending with right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):
I guess I need a licensing deal with New York check. Anyway. Okay. I want to go on a totally different tangent. We weren't planning to talk about this. I know that I said this, we're going to be fully focused on this one topic, but there's something you mentioned to me before we start recording that I think will be really interesting to a lot of people. 

(01:04:34):
You guys at Reforge are now building actual SaaS products that people can buy. It's not just courses. I don't know if people know that, but let's make sure people understand this. There's actually products for product teams, so maybe just explain that briefly, but the thing that I think is really interesting here is you work with a lot of companies now selling them AI tools, and you have noticed a very big difference between the companies that are really good at adopting AI tools and seeing gains from them from those that don't. Talk about just what you see there, and because this is in theory going to be really helpful to companies that are struggling with adopting AI tools and seeing gains.

Brian Balfour (01:05:09):
Just to quickly explain that transition so it makes sense for people, which is, I started Reforge just with the interest that there was all these incredible leaders out there growing on the front lines of some of the fastest growing companies and they have all this amazing knowledge and I wanted to encode it in useful and practical ways for others. That took the form of courses and content and product, all that kind of stuff at the beginning. Along the way, everybody kept asking us to essentially build the tools to implement what we taught. Because with anything, you can learn as much as you want. You can listen to my podcast, your podcast, Lenny, whatever, as much as you want, but if you don't actually put it into action and implement it, then it's not really going to create value. 

(01:05:56):
People kept asking us to really close that gap and we said no for the longest time. And then about a couple of years ago when AI really started to inflect, it really created this moment that, oh, wow, now there's this opportunity not just to encode this knowledge into content, but also into the products, the software, the tools that we use ourselves. So we started to take a really big bet on that and started to develop this new platform for AI-native product teams. 

(01:06:22):
The first product we launched is called Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher, aggregates all the feedback from all the sources, uses AI to analyze it, helps you explore it, but also will start to identify what are the gaps, the things that you don't have in your feedback today and auto-generate the research to go gather all those new insights, so complete the full cycle. We're going to launch two other major products as part of this platform before the end of the year, but we'll save that for some future episode. 

(01:06:53):
So that's been our journey. We've seen inside companies that are going through this transformation from two perspectives. One is obviously selling in that tools, but the other perspective is, for 10 years, companies have been coming to us to help them try some sort of transformation with our learning product.

(01:07:15):
Most companies are not coming to us to just throw a bunch of courses in front of, they're trying to solve some big business problem, some transformation. Now that used to be things like, we've got to figure out this growth thing, or I'm going from sales-led to product-led, or I have more project managers and I need to transition to product managers, something like that. There's some business problem, they're going through some transformation and they saw us as part of that transformation and we got to partake in quite a few of those types of transformation.

(01:07:50):
Now of course, the transformation that everybody's going through is, okay, how do I become more AI-native? How do I adopt this stuff? We've seen a pretty wide spectrum and from both perspectives of how companies are approaching this. I'm sure everybody's seen that AI, we've been calling them the AI manifesto memos from CEOs out there that proclaim, "We are now AI-native," in some grandiose way, but behind the scenes, there's actually some incredibly stark differences in the actual teeth of what backs up those memos and backs up those executive decrees that we should all be AI.

(01:08:43):
Just to point out a few of them, which is, one is that I think the most impactful thing that you can do is form really hard constraints. There's other parts that's like, okay, you want to communicate this, you want to establish an owner of who's going to drive this, you want to build an incentives and rewards, and you see this all playing out in things like building it into your career ladders, or some people are starting to introduce this as questions into their performance reviews, all those types of pieces. But the thing that is actually moving the needle are the companies that are defining incredibly hard constraints. 

(01:09:30):
One company that we worked with developed this constraint that they benchmarked against other companies of their revenue size and the team sizes for those stages, and they set a benchmark that we will be one-fifth, each of our functions will be one-fifth the size. What that did is it created a constraint that you couldn't hire above that level, and it forced people to essentially find ways to adopt AI and do things to replace that. So that was one. 

(01:10:01):
You've seen these other ones, I can't remember from what company, that might've been Shopify or another, who was like, you are not allowed new headcount until you prove to us that you are not able to accomplish this with AI. That's another hard constraint. But you also see these other constraints on a smaller level, which is executives saying, "I will not do a product review or review a PRD unless it comes with three prototypes." Something like that. That's the hardest one. Those are the biggest constraints.

(01:10:33):
I think the biggest change that I'm seeing is, and the things that separates out the top few percent making this change and everybody else is essentially making the hardest decisions, and that hardest decision is going to come down to exiting people. In every transformation, what we see is essentially three groups of folks. We call them the catalysts, the people leading the charge, the people who are experimenting, doing this on their own time, all that kind of stuff. 

(01:11:07):
You then have what we call your converts. These are folks that will make the transformation, they will adapt, but they need structure, they need permission, they need a clear outline, they need a clear plan. I don't say this in a negative way, it's just that that's how some people operate. That's where things like all the things that we were talking about before, which was the decree, the permission, the clear budgets, the rewards, all of those types of things. 

(01:11:37):
But then, inevitably you have a certain percentage that are anchors. They're dragging their feet, they're silently creating friction in the background and all those pieces. There's a big difference in how I think companies are treating and thinking about their strategy for those folks. One group is like, ah, we're going to work with them very passively. Others have set a hard deadline. They're either going to make the transformation by X date or we're going to exit folks. 

(01:12:13):
A lot of people look at this as being really harsh. I think a lot of people would think that, especially individuals, but let me explain it from more of a CEO perspective. A lot of these companies are seeing this AI transformation, the ones that are taking it more seriously, as this isn't adopting new tools, this isn't a light change. This is a fundamental culture change of how we operate as a company. You can't have 20, 30%, whatever meaningful number of it is of your company trying to operate in a completely different way, in a completely different culture.

(01:12:48):
Cultures thrive on density, and that's why there's sometimes the best ones feel like cults. As a result, from that perspective, it's like, hey, for us to be successful, for this to be the best thing for all employees, we all need to be operating around the same culture of principles and stuff. If that's not you anymore, then we're defining a plan to exit it.

(01:13:16):
I would say that less than 10% of companies we see are taking this hard stance, but I would say they are probably the ones that are farthest along getting the most adoption and are seeing the most results of the ones that are taking those hard stances. There's a bunch of other stuff I could talk about, but that's the high level of what we've seen across a bunch of different companies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):
That is incredibly interesting. I'm glad we went there. I have a newsletter post coming out soon, probably before this episode, that touches on a lot of advice along these lines. I am excited for you guys to keep seeing these insights into companies and sharing more of this because this is I think what a lot of people are looking for, just like things aren't quite clicking at our company. We keep hearing everyone just getting so much more productive. All these companies are running more efficiently and it's not working here. I think that's the kind of advice a lot of people are looking for, so thank you for sharing all that. 

(01:14:09):
Brian, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on? Anything else you wanted to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Brian Balfour (01:14:15):
Well, actually, just a couple more points on this topic we should go. There's probably two more things I would say about this. One is that, if you're a CEO listening to this, I would say that most CEOs or most executives are incredibly disconnected from the actual AI adoption taking place inside their companies. I think a lot of executives who have done these decrees and all that kind of stuff think it's happening naturally, but we talked to both groups. We talked to tons of end users and we talked to tons of executives. 

(01:14:49):
The story we hear from the end users, the PMs, the eng, all that kind of stuff that we talk to using all this stuff, one of the main questions we ask them is, if we're talking to somebody who's picked up a prototyping tool, say, "Well, how many other people on the product and design team are using this?" Almost 90% of the time it's like, "Ah, it's me and this one other person," and everybody else hasn't taken it up. So there's a huge disconnect. 

(01:15:17):
We heard one story, and I can't say the name, but it's a company we all know. It's a major tech company, a tech-forward company. CEO's been out there talking about being AI-native. We talked to one of their principal PMs. Person was early to the prototyping tools. This person shared a prototype with the designer, the eng manager. The designer and eng manager escalated it to the VPs. It caused this whole conversation. Month later, it was still stalling out. This PM happened to then attend a happy hour where the CEO was at and approached the CEO and told the CEO about the experiment that they were running with prototyping and stuff, and the CEO was like, "This is fantastic. Where is it at right now?" He was like, "Oh, well, X, Y, Z happened." The CEO had no idea. And then the CEO is like, "Okay, let me take care of it," and then the next day, it happened.

(01:16:18):
So one is that you have to go to the ground floor on this stuff. Some of the best companies like Shopify and others are measuring actual adoption and usage. They've gone to the extreme on that front to get a bunch of signals and close to the ground. It just goes to show that this is... I don't think we want to talk about going founder mode, but the reality is it's not just about getting into the weeds of your product, but with something this sizable, you got to get into the weeds of the transformation to really understand what's going on and adopt it. That's point number one. 

(01:16:58):
The second point I would say is Fareed, we do this podcast called Unsolicited Feedback, Fareed Mosavat had this great quote on it. He was like, "Look, your output is constrained by the slowest part of your system." That stuck in my head because it's absolutely true. If you think about AI adoption as a system, there's all parts of the system that could be slowing adoption. It might be that people don't feel permission or they don't have the budget or they don't have the knowledge, all these types of things. In a lot of these cases, it's things like IT, legal, procurement are the slowest part of the friction and are setting the pace of all of this output.

(01:17:43):
You can also see this in just product teams. There's been all this talk about product managers are becoming the new bottleneck because engineers are speeding up. Well, that's because people are speeding up one part of the product system and not the other parts, which makes sense. They adopted all of this tooling for engineers because they're the biggest head count and the most expensive and all that type of stuff, but product is an output of design, PMs, and engineering. The system is there not to produce code, it's to ship product, and shipping product is the function of those three things. 

(01:18:19):
If you just accelerate one part of the system, you're just going to move to the bottleneck to another part and your actual product output, the output of the system doesn't accelerate, either. I think people have to really understand those two things: what is actually happening on the ground floor, and what is the slowest part? What is the thing that is causing the slowest part of the adoption? Just attack them ruthlessly if you're really serious about making this transition.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:47):
What a wild time we're living through. So much changes. 

Brian Balfour (01:18:48):
It is a wild time, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):
All these ways that we're all so used to, okay, this is how we do it.

Brian Balfour (01:18:54):
Yeah. It's exciting and exhausting at the same time, man. That's how I think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):
Such a simple way of describing the road.

Brian Balfour (01:19:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:03):
Oh, my God. Okay, Brian, is there anything else before we get through our very exciting lightning round?

Brian Balfour (01:19:08):
That's it. Let's do lightning round.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:09):
Here we go.

Brian Balfour (01:19:09):
Zap, zap, zap. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:11):
Ding, ding, ding. All right, Brian, I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Brian Balfour (01:19:14):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:14):
Okay. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Brian Balfour (01:19:20):
My God honest answer is that I have not had the time to finish an entire book since I had my second child. From a complete book standpoint, I have not been able to... Things that I actively read on a regular basis, just other content out there that I'll throw out there is, gosh, Jamin Ball from Altimeter Capital writes this great newsletter called Clouded Judgment, which is mixture of market thoughts as well as market stats. That's really useful to help me keep a pulse on the market. I was just reading through some stuff from NFX that's been pretty good lately on all of this. I know James Currier and I, we lived a lot of the same cycles through social and stuff, so I tend to identify with that. I don't know, those are two things that I love reading.

(01:20:19):
Sorry, I'll give one more shout-out to a different podcast, which is from two guys at Spark Capital, Nabeel Hyatt, which I know from my early Boston days, and Fraser, sorry, I'm blanking on the last name right now, who was Head of Product at OpenAI, and they've got a great format where it's just those two riffing on some ideas and stuff. I highly suggest that one. I like that one a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):
Here's my reading tip that has changed my reading habits. Bryan Johnson, the longevity guy, he has this advice for better sleep, which includes, before you go to sleep, read for 10 minutes in bed. 

Brian Balfour (01:20:58):
It does put you to sleep. I don't feel like I retain anything that I read that close to bed, though. Do you feel like you retain it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:05):
I do, I do. I'm reading fiction. It's nonfiction. Sorry. You want to read something calm, not like I'm learning. I'm reading fiction and it's really nice. Knowing that this is going to help me sleep better makes me motivated. 

Brian Balfour (01:21:17):
There's an incentive. There's a reward there. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:19):
The reward, yeah. 

Brian Balfour (01:21:20):
They're talking about rewards and creating behavior change, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:23):
Exactly. The reason to do it is this whole thing is you want to get to low resting heart rate, and that helps lower your resting heart. 

Brian Balfour (01:21:29):
I've got some other sleep tips on that front if you want to go down that path, but we'll save that for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:34):
Please, for the third podcast. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really recently enjoyed?

Brian Balfour (01:21:40):
It's not new, but I just rewatched Silicon Valley that I hadn't watched in a number of times. It's painful because the first few seasons, I went through almost every one of those moments in my first startup, like hiring the gray-haired CEO, the funding falling through at the last second, all the crazy stuff, but going back and watching that, there's just some extra nuances and stuff that I feel like they wrote really well that I thought was really good. I've really been watching that. 

(01:22:16):
The other thing that I've watched is just more of a just pure entertainment, calming thing, turn the brain off is Owen Wilson's new show on Apple TV, Stick, which is about him as a former professional golfer and all that. I won't ruin the show and stuff, but it's a very nice calming, little bit fun type of show. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
I've been seeing that on my Apple TV. Maybe I should check it out. Good tip. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? It could be a gadget, it could be a app on your phone, it could be something in your computer. It could be nothing at all.

Brian Balfour (01:22:54):
You can't see it, but I just changed my whole setup. Now I have a UltraGear super-wide curved screen with a very nice standing desk from, I believe it's called Ergonofis. Er.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):
Ergonofis?

Brian Balfour (01:23:15):
Yes. I think it's Ergonofis, E-R-G-O-N-O-F-I-S. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:21):
All right. 

Brian Balfour (01:23:21):
It's a very nice, sleek standing desk. Very stable, very quiet. Very much enjoy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:29):
Excellent tip. And the curved monitor, very cool. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life, something you share with folks, something that you think about when times are hard or just generally?

Brian Balfour (01:23:42):
Look, it's a little cliche at this point, but it's somewhere around here, I used to have the quote printed out about the man in the arena. Especially in times like this where so many things are changing and there's so much competition, but so much opportunity for great, I really both respect and enjoy the game and spending time with folks that are in the arena figuring this stuff out, tinkering with things. That's what I keep coming back to, especially been at Reforge for 10 years, that's a good portion of my life, and we've gone through some great periods and some tough periods, so I tend to come back to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:30):
And that's what always separated Reforge from so much other content and advice is it's people in the arena sharing their wisdom, not just a bunch of influencers. It's sad that Chamath made that quote so cringey.

Brian Balfour (01:24:41):
I know, I know. That's why I said it's a little cliche cringe right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:47):
Screwed it up for everyone. 

Brian Balfour (01:24:49):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:49):
Final question. Brian, you don't know this, but your parenting advice on Adam Fishman's podcast-

Brian Balfour (01:24:54):
Oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:55):
... really impacted my parenting philosophy, specifically this line you had about independence.

Brian Balfour (01:25:01):
Oh, yes. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:02):
I'd love for you to just share that insight about how you think about raising kids,

Brian Balfour (01:25:08):
I wish I could remember where I grabbed this from so I could attribute it properly, but basically, the philosophy is, if you think about going from when they're born until they're essentially 18 and leave the home, your job as a parent is to essentially make them more and more independent. What that involves is continuously looking for opportunities for them to make even bigger and riskier decisions for themselves as they grow up and you're there as a support to those decisions, but letting them make those decisions on their own so that by the time they're 18, they are a fully independent person able to think through those decisions themselves. 

(01:26:03):
Now, look, my sons are young. They're five and three, so it's not like I'm having them make life and death decisions or where we might buy our next house or stuff like that, but it's even small things at this age of... My oldest, five and a half, is really starting to learn and get curious about money and how you spend money and where new things come from and how you earn money. Rather than just buying things for him, he's got money from his grandparents and stuff saved up, and we can be like, "Okay, you can buy that thing, but you're going to spend this," and try to teach him the consequences and all that kind of stuff, and then when he breaks something...

(01:26:50):
It's just small things like that, but thinking about the time from zero to 18 as this spectrum of independence and being a supporting role in what you're essentially doing is you're trying to move as many decisions, the percentage of decisions you make for them down to zero by the time that they're 18. That's something that I've kept in the back of my head since really seeing that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:19):
Thank you for sharing that. I know I didn't tell you that I was going to ask you about this, so that was a beautiful way of summarizing it. 

Brian Balfour (01:27:25):
Yeah, I couldn't remember that whole podcast. I had no idea what I said, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:25):
I would say you nailed it.

Brian Balfour (01:27:28):
... that's a good one, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:31):
Brian, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and where can they find the products you guys offer? Whatever you want to plug. Also, how can listeners be useful to you?

Brian Balfour (01:27:41):
Check out reforge.com. Check out our new products like Reforge Insights. They're on the website. You can find me personally, my writing, including a bunch of the stuff that we talked about today now on Substack. Just recently moved. You can either go to my website, brianbalfour.com, where I have some info or just the blog.brianbalfour.com where all of my new writing is taking place. Those are the two major pieces. 

(01:28:08):
Last but not least is that, as I mentioned, Fareed Mosavat, who I used to work with at Slack, we have this fun podcast. The two of us get on there and riff like we were having dinner every couple of weeks about different product and strategy types of things. It's a fun format for us, so if that's something you enjoy, it's called Unsolicited Feedback, where we give feedback and advice to nobody that ever asked for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:36):
That's amazing. Perfect title. Brian, thank you so much for being here.

Brian Balfour (01:28:41):
Yeah, thanks for having me again. This is great. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:43):

# Lessons from scaling Uber and Opendoor | Brian Tolkin (Head of Product at Opendoor, ex-Uber)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You've worked at two businesses that have done incredibly well combining product in ops.

Brian Tolkin (00:00:03):
Uber always has this mentality and Opendoor does two of the product operations, twin turbine jet plane where you can fly the plane on one engine for a little bit if you need to, but it's operating most efficiently and effectively if both are working together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):
What has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader?

Brian Tolkin (00:00:21):
Gave a really deep understanding of how the business actually works. It's a pretty good foundation for them going on to say, okay, what do we actually want to build in a more scalable technology way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
Something else I've heard that you're very good at is staying very calm under pressure.

Brian Tolkin (00:00:34):
I've slept on the floor in China before launching uberPOOL, and when you reflect the stress onto your teams, everybody tenses out. It counterintuitively doesn't produce better outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):
Today my guest is Brian Tolkin. Brian is currently head of product and design at Opendoor. Before that, he spent nearly five years at Uber where he joined as employee 100. Before Uber had UberX or uberPOOL or any shared rides, he actually started on the ops team at Uber, moved into product, ended up leading product and launch of uberPOOL, and then taking it global. He also started the product operations function at Uber. Before that function was really even a thing, which I didn't know until the chat that we had. In our conversation, Brian shares a ton of lessons about building products with a heavy operational component. Also, how to run great product reviews, how he implements the jobs to be done, framework and Opendoor's successfully.

(00:01:32):
The story behind Zillow trying to compete with Opendoor failing and then partnering instead. Plus a ton of great stories from the early days of Uber and Opendoor, and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Brian Tolkin. Brian, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Brian Tolkin (00:02:00):
Thank you, appreciate it. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):
First of all, just a huge thank you to Kayvon Beykpour for connecting us, introducing us. He said all kinds of amazingly nice things about you. He also gave me some very hard questions to ask you. I hope you've come prepared.

Brian Tolkin (00:02:12):
Terrific. Put me in my hot seat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:14):
Okay, I want to spend a bunch of time talking about product and ops. You started your career in operations. At Uber you actually started on the ops team and you moved into product. You've also worked at both Uber and at Opendoor, which have both huge operational components. I think it's really rare that people, one, see a company scale to the heights of Uber and Opendoor with such a heavy operational component that are still tech companies and also it's really where someone starts an ops and then moves into product and ends up where you are, where your chief product officer, really successful company. So I have a bunch of questions here. Maybe the first is just what has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader? How does that change the way that you operate as a product leader?

Brian Tolkin (00:02:58):
Starting on the operations side gave a really deep understanding of how the business actually works. You are truly operating it day in and day out and the success of the city is in large part driven by the inputs that you are putting into it every single day on the ground and whether or not there was rain that weekend, which was a nice driver of metrics, but talking to customers every single day like one-on-one onboarding drivers responding to support tickets, there's no centralized support team, there was no closer to the customer, right? And so I think that foundation actually for really understanding what moves the business and being super close to the customer actually is a pretty good foundation for them going on to say, okay, what do we actually want to build in a more scalable technology way?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:52):

This episode is brought to you by Explo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting. Are your users craving more dashboards, reports and analytics within your product?

(00:06:18):
Try it for free at explo.co/lenny. That's E-X-P-L-O/lenny. I've seen that a lot of companies, and this was definitely true to Airbnb, where the product team looks down a little bit on the ops team where they're like, "oh, we're doing things that are going to scale to millions of users. We're doing these things that are going to apply to everyone." There's this ops team over there doing a few things that are going to not scale. They keep asking us for things to build for their one-off ideas. What do you think that product teams often maybe miss or don't understand about the ops teams that would help them see them in a different light?

Brian Tolkin (00:06:56):
Yeah, it's a great question and I think Uber always had this mentality and OpenDoor does too of like a twin turbine jet plane where you can fly the plane on one engine for a little bit if you need to, but it's operating most efficiently and effectively if both are working together, and I think that's really true, right? The reality is operations teams, local teams, can iterate faster, can scale talking to customers really much more efficiently, have great qualitative insights, and so if it's seen more as a harmony instead of a competition, I think that's really, really helpful where it's like, okay, how do we get the insights that are happening day in and day out in the field, on the ground, whatever that may be, and help us build better products because of that, right?

(00:07:50):
Like a PM sitting in San Francisco can't be in Opendoor's case 50 markets, walking houses every single day in Uber's case, whatever, a thousand cities understanding the nuances of safety in South America and it's just not possible, but what you can do is foster a really good relationship and a really good feedback loop of how people who do deeply understand those things can help give insights. Now is actually the birth of product operations was that insight as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:22):
Can you say more on that?

Brian Tolkin (00:08:23):
Yeah, sure. So, sorry, I should probably define what product operations was. At Uber it was basically this notion that we had centralized, this was later in my career at Uber, but we had a centralized product team building stuff mostly in San Francisco, not strictly through the Ross, but at this point around the world, but mostly in San Francisco and then we had a very globally distributed operations team, and there was a bidirectional feedback loop that wasn't super strong and that feedback loop was basically when the EPD teams in San Francisco built new features, how do we effectively put it in global markets and then how do we effectively get input from global markets to better build features. And so one solution to that problem, our solution at the time was to start up a new function called product operations who had accountability and reported into operations but physically sat with and operated much like a member of the product team to help solve that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):
Is that maybe the first time there's a... Did you invent product operations as a function?

Brian Tolkin (00:09:28):
I don't think so because at the time, I believe Google had a function, I can't remember what Google called it was something slightly different, but I met with a few folks who had been in similar type roles at Google and a couple other places, so I don't take credit for certainly for inventing IT and other people have actually dabbled in this model at Uber before me there was just a formalization of it and our actual building out of the organization, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:54):
Did none of that. Sounds like you basically helped make it a thing. I know you're being very modest, I think. Coming back to your point about decentralized operations teams, something I've read is that search pricing came out of one GM and a market just testing, emailing all the drivers, hey, we're going to give you extra if you drive on Saturday night. Is that true?

Brian Tolkin (00:10:15):
That would've been probably a little bit before my time, but that being said, one thing that is true is that surge pricing for actually quite sometimes all of 2012, certainly 2013 probably, I don't know when we necessarily switched, was very much a human in the loop system or a very manual system where GMs in every city would control basically the parameters in which surge would operate and so much of the time that would need, for example, Monday through Friday, there would be no search, it couldn't flip on, and then Friday nights and Saturday nights it would flip on from whatever you set, 7:00 PM to 3:00 AM and the cap was X, whatever the cap was. And then within those parameters the algorithm would optimize for what the price was. But yeah, GMs controlled whether it was on or off and what geographies were surging.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:16):
Wow, I didn't know that. Was that out of we believe we are better than the algorithms or we just don't have time to make them amazing yet, so we're just going to help them along?

Brian Tolkin (00:11:25):
Yeah, I think it was probably a function of a bunch of stuff, one of which is like, hey, this is a fairly new concept and it's powerful and dangerous and so let's make sure we understand what's happening. The second is this belief that local city teams know their cities best and so you might know that an event is happening, a baseball game gets out and it's like, oh, I know that this baseball game's going to get out at 10:00 PM so I'm going to set surge at 9:45 and the algorithm may not be able to pick that up. And then the third is the technical constraint of nowadays clearly it's all automated, but it's really hard to build a fully dynamic, always on geospatially aware pricing system and not just a little bit of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):
That makes sense. I feel like you're full of wild stories from your time at Uber. Is there one that comes to mind of just, I think you helped scale in China, uberPOOL?

Brian Tolkin (00:12:17):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:29):
Maybe that's the one. I don't know. Can you share wild story from early Uber days?

Brian Tolkin (00:12:31):
Yeah, so in the early days of Uber, one fun story is obviously UberX is a random mainstream product but has a funny, silly name, UberX. This product in the early days was going to be all hybrid and had a bunch of different potential names. I was not personally driving this, this was someone else on the operations team, but they built the model for what this product could be and there's no name for it yet, so it was going to be a placeholder. So what do you put in some placeholder? X. So UberX and then the company was moving quickly enough, the product got the green light, it launched, and here we are, I don't know, 12 years later, 11 years later, whatever it is and UberX is the name that stuck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:21):
That is hilarious. I love it. So it was a placeholder. It's like many products start that way where they're like, this is just the temporary name, and they're like, okay, I guess everyone just knows it this way now we're going to stick with it.

Brian Tolkin (00:13:31):
Exactly. It's too expensive to change and rebrand at this point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:34):
That's an awesome story.

Brian Tolkin (00:13:36):
One that is good about scaling Uber uberPOOL in China is we were launching Uber pool in China and this was going to be, China at the time was pretty big for Uber, but uberPOOL was not there yet, and so we were going to launch. And myself and a few other folks were in Chengdu China, which is the first Chinese market that we were launching uberPOOL in and we were going to be on the ground took to launch. We wanted to go live at, I believe it was 6:00 AM for rush hour on, I don't remember the day, but whatever, Monday morning, and so we're there over the weekend getting ready to set up and at the same time we were doing some data center testing. And so we flipped on all the testing infrastructure and thought it was going to work and nothing works, and the matching algorithm just isn't working and we're like, oh my god, now it's whatever, 5:00 PM the day before we're supposed to go live, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM okay, let's get on the phone with the US, try and figure out what's going on.

(00:14:43):
I remember I slept about 30 minutes that night between 2:00 and 3:00 AM being like, okay, well, we have to go live at 6:00 AM I think there was some press around it. We were planning on going live and I think we got everything finally working at probably about five 30 or six in the morning and launched just in the nick of time. And I'll never forget, we launched, it was great, we monitored, everything was good, and then we walked out for breakfast at 7:30 in the morning. Everyone sleep depressed, no one slept all night and we got these pancakes street food things and I have to imagine they were not that good, but in my mind it was the best meal I've ever had in my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):
It's like a meal after a marathon or a big hike.

Brian Tolkin (00:15:31):
Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:32):
Everything's so delicious. This comes up a lot of just these moments that are so incredibly stressful and hard and leap deprived end up being the best memories and the best stories to tell and things you look back at fondly. It's so weird how human nature is like that.

Brian Tolkin (00:15:46):
Yeah, I mean another one more recent for Opendoor was when COVID hit, physically we buy and sell homes, and so we were physically going into people's homes and suddenly March 2020 going into people's homes was not something people were comfortable with. And you look at the real estate data coming out of China at the time and it looked like coming to a standstill, and so we actually turned off the core business and we stopped buying homes for a few months. hey, we can't go in and we don't know if anyone's going to be buying any homes, and so what do we do? And we took those few months and then came out the other side and had virtualized the whole process. Then it was pretty stressful, right, because looking at a business that relies on going into people's homes and suddenly you can't do that anymore, what do you do? So, again, a fond memory to look back on a very stressful time in the moment where it feels very, very difficult.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):
Just since you mentioned Opendoor, I think many people have heard of Opendoor. Maybe just give a quick explanation of what Opendoor does for people that aren't exactly sure.

Brian Tolkin (00:16:58):
So we're a digital platform to buy and sell real estate. The core product today is a seller focused product where people can go online, enter some information about their home, and we'll make an all cash offer to be able to sell simplicity and certainty. So the product really works for people who want something that is certain and simple and easy. I don't know if you've ever sold a home, but it can be a very, very, very successful difficult process with showings and open houses and how to price it and will it sell and all of that stuff. And so we offer basically a way to skip the whole process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:41):
So you basically sell your house to Opendoor and it's just like, cool, done, move on.

Brian Tolkin (00:17:45):
You picked your closing date, you move out when you want. Yeah, there's no hassle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
Sounds amazing. I want that. Coming back to ops and product, just to close this thread again, you've worked at two businesses that have done incredibly well combining product and ops. Are there any just broad lessons you've taken away from how to make these two teams and functions work well together and to build a business that's very ops heavy but also offer driven?

Brian Tolkin (00:18:15):
The first one we touched on, which is a, there's just got to be mutual respect. Both functions have their time and their place and their skillsets, and you just don't build big businesses of this type without respecting the fact that that both need to exist. The second, particularly on the product and engineering side, is really understanding where and how the technology leverage comes from the business and then being really focused on making sure generally, especially in the earlier days, you are more limited on the technical resourcing side than you might be on the operational resourcing side. And so how do you be really focused on where to invest your time, effort, and energy technically, which is why most of the engineering effort for Uber was on the dispatching system and the pricing system. That's just where the leverage was at the time, given the scarcity of resources.

(00:19:11):
And so I think the second one is being really intentional about where those techs are and then being really forthcoming and saying, hey, that means all these other places where yes, it can make things easier, more efficient, et cetera, et cetera. We are okay not investing in right now, and that needs to be an explicit decision and very transparent. But then the last bit I would say is a deep understanding that the real world has entropy and it's hard and it's messy for us at Opendoor, we go into homes, someone may not be home, scheduling may be off, at Uber the driver may cancel the radio GPS. All these things happen, right? Computers are deterministic, but humans aren't, right? And so building products that have a little bit more flex or a little bit more fail safes in case those things happen becomes a little bit more of a paramount.

(00:20:08):
One other thing, the last thing I would say is I think that the companies evolve as well. So what I talked about at the beginning of Uber being very focused from an engineering and product side on the dispatching system and the pricing system, obviously over time not to evolve now it centralized all of these functions as the company got bigger and more mature and scale and optimization started to be more important and expansion and that Petri dish of trying new stuff and the tools got better and the tech got easier and there was more internal infrastructure. And so over time things can start one way and shift over time as the business needs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:52):
Let's actually spend more time there. You keep saying things that make me want to dig deeper. So at Airbnb we went through the same thing where there was all these local ops teams driving supply, finding homes, bringing out the platform, and then there's this tipping point where the product in organic growth or word of mouth ended up driving more and then orders of magnitude more. So there was no need for these folks to spend time doing these things. Can you just maybe share an example, either we Opendoor, when you talk about there's a time and a place and a skillset for ops, how that evolved? What was the team doing initially and then what did they end up doing as things grew?

Brian Tolkin (00:21:25):
Yeah, I mean, maybe a very easy good example to pick just one part of the Uber process in the early days is at small scale, actually back when it was Uber black drivers, every driver was individually onboarded in a 90 minute to a two-hour in-person in the office onboarding with deep setting of expectations. The next version of that... So that's obviously very ops driven. The next version of that is a small classroom type setting of three or five or six drivers at a given time. Also, very ops driven. And then as we got into more mass market products like Uber Taxi or UberX, it was like, okay, maybe 20 or 30 at a time. So now it's a little bit bigger classroom setting. And we said, okay, let's make a video. Instead of giving verbally the same presentation, let's just make an onboarding video and that was the next set of scale, but now suddenly we have a different problem, which is okay, you have to validate all of these credentials.

(00:22:32):
So most driver's license who they are, all that stuff at one person, easy at three to four at a time, easy, 10 at a time, a little more challenging but fine. At 20 at a time, okay, you're starting to run up onto it now you fast-forward six months and you're doing a thousand a week or whatever, suddenly your system breaks and it's like, okay, we have reached the point where operational system improvements is no longer viable. So, you say, okay, we have gone from the iteration stage to the scale stage and technology is uniquely good at scaling. So now we say, okay, instead of having a bunch of folks around the world taking pictures of driver's licenses and validating and doing all that stuff, how do we integrate with some type of OCR technology or auto recognition of driver's licenses that feeds to a system that knows what a driver's license is or can do automatic validation and suddenly you've done two things.

(00:23:27):
One, you've scaled your system, and two, you've just created a ton of time for what at the time was probably dozens if not hundreds of people running these onboarding sessions all over the country, the world at the time to do other stuff. And so now you can level that up and say, okay, do we do more analytics? Do we do more figure out the next process that needs optimization or whatever the case may be in that virtuous cycle just continues.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:53):
The way I like to think about this is do things that don't scale and then scale the things that you're doing. That's the phrase I always come back to.

Brian Tolkin (00:23:58):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):
This reminds me of a hot take that previous podcast guest shared in a newsletter post Casey Winters. He talked about that operations is usually, and it's a hot take, that operations is a sign of inefficiency and over time your job is to squeeze that away and make it product software as much as possible. Doesn't mean you always get there. Thoughts?

Brian Tolkin (00:24:23):
Yeah, I actually don't. Fundamentally, it depends on what the operations is, but I don't fundamentally disagree, but I think that the right lens to think about it is... And then those folks can move on to the next challenge. And so there's always another hill to climb. And so I think that was one of the things at Uber and Opendoor where there's this culture of on the ground experimentation that's really helpful where we were just talking about driver onboarding may now be solved with technology so you have a few extra hours a day. How do we get better at optimizing the UberX system? How do you start tinkering with food delivery? How do you start thinking about higher capacity vehicles? How do you think about better feedback loop for those manual surge pricing toggles that we talked about? So I generally agree it just generally free across and solve more problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:21):
It feels like a big part of this is making sure the operations teams understand there's more opportunity, even if this ends up being automated, your job is not going to go away. We're going to find something new to try and experiment and do things that don't skip.

Brian Tolkin (00:25:34):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:34):
Awesome. Okay. Going a completely different direction.

Brian Tolkin (00:25:37):
Great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:38):
I hear you're very good at product reviews.

Brian Tolkin (00:25:40):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
A few people told me this. I'm curious how you set up a product review and any things you've learned, any tips for how to run an effective product review?

Brian Tolkin (00:25:48):
That's very whoever mentioned that. But yes, big fan of doing them actually in particular to maybe bridge the conversations in companies that have ops driven cadences or start out very ops driven because the cadences can sometimes be different. And so the operational cadences that you might have something like a WVRA weekly business review may not be conducive to always picking your head up and saying like, Hey, where's the product going on a slightly longer timeframe. And so I think product reviews in general for all companies are probably really helpful, but actually in particular for some of the product and operations led companies. In terms of things I've learned, I think being really intentional about what the goals are, I think it's okay to say that there are two goals, a goal of accountability and inform to an audience.

(00:26:43):
But also most importantly, I think this is the primary goal is to help make the product better, to help the teams think through a problem and to have that, again, back to our earliest conversation, be a very intellectual conversation about the work and how to make the product better and not super scary. Product reviews hopefully are not feeling like firing squads. That's a scary environment to be in and not necessarily one that's conducive to how do we make the product better. Obviously sometimes the conversations have to get a little intense, but in general that's what we're shooting for is something that helps the team go back and think through how to make the product better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:24):
So the two goals you try to communicate for your product reviews, accountability slash informing people what's happening, but also just like we are here to make the product better and setting that context. Yep. Is there anything you'd do specifically to make it not feel like a firing squad? Like you're coming in here to be attacked and criticized? Do you set context at the beginning of the meeting? Is this just a part of the culture?

Brian Tolkin (00:27:43):
Yeah, I think definitely part of the culture, but also I am a firm believer in general that the people closest to the problems also have the best context to solve that problem. And so as a more senior voice in the room, often the job is probing, asking questions, throwing out ideas in a way that says like, hey, this is an idea. This is not a mandate, this is a thought. And if there's context missing that would inform the product direction, then providing that context in not a question asking sense, but hey, this is context that you might not be aware of. And so I think it's all in how you show up as a leader and what that looks like in terms of probing and pushing the team on dimensions that they may not be thinking about. And then understanding that the team is bringing a perspective that you don't have, which is they think about this problem 40, 50, 60 hours a week, and you might think about this problem three hours a week. So you bring them a breath, the team brings a depth in haven't been there yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:49):
I don't know if you heard Dharmesh Shah's episode or his thing on flash tags. Have you seen this?

Brian Tolkin (00:28:54):
I have not, no.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:55):
Okay. He has a whole system. So you talked about how as a leader you want people to not take everything you tell them as feedback as I need to do this. So he has a whole set of hashtags that communicate how important this is to him from hashtag FYI to suggestion, to a plea.

Brian Tolkin (00:29:13):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
A plea to you.

Brian Tolkin (00:29:17):
This was actually explained to me. I don't think I've seen the original source, so I'll go back and watch it, but this was explained to me as I'm actually a big fan. I think that's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):
Yeah, just get everyone on the same page. Okay. Maybe one last question here. Who do you try to invite to product reviews? Do you have any frameworks and ways of thinking of who to invite, who not to invite?

Brian Tolkin (00:29:36):
Yeah, good question. We, I would say have oscillated over time, but in general, big subscribers of the best conversations happen when they're relatively small, so try and keep it under 10. Could be wide distribution of the document. The artifacts created are actually really powerful and they're powerful for the whole team to understand. And secret power is they're very powerful for new people who are onboarding to be like, here are the last 20 product reviews, you'll get a pretty good idea of what's going on. But generally the conversation itself try and be relatively tight. We try to keep it under 10.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:15):
And these artifacts, you mean the recordings of the meeting that people can watch or?

Brian Tolkin (00:30:20):
Yeah. Or just the document depends on what the company culture is, whether you want to record it or just have the document either way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:26):
And then is there some specific cadence you operate on? Is it like a weekly product review that people can sign up for? Does every team, how do you like to set this up the cadence?

Brian Tolkin (00:30:35):
Yeah, obviously it scales are with the size of the company. For us right now, what's working well is signup cadence. We have two slots a week that anyone can sign up for as their product area needs it. And then if there's something that we would love to see that we haven't seen in a bit, we do a little bit of all in telling to make sure that the work is generally cycling through on a quarterly basis.

(00:31:54):
Adjacent topic. I hear you're a big fan of drops to be done, which is okay, so it's a fun recurring topic on this podcast. We've had many people that love it, many people that hate it. I love seeing both sides of it. I love that you find it helpful and you implement it at Opendoor. I'd love to hear just how you actually apply it at Opendoor, what you've learned about how to apply jobs to be done effectively.

Brian Tolkin (00:32:17):
Yeah. I think like all frameworks, the right answer is to pick your set of frameworks, have more tools in your toolbox, and then actually understand when and how to apply them. So we try to avoid being a hammer and everything's a nail. We try to for course the framework if it's not working. But I think what I really like about it is it forces you to put yourself in the customer's shoes. I think in a slightly deeper way and be a little bit more empathetic when I think about building at Opendoor versus say building at Uber or when you are building at Airbnb is we are not... Most people at Opendoor, we don't have homes to sell every week or every month, nor do we buy homes every week or every month. On average in the US is something people do once every seven years.

(00:33:10):
I'm sure the average at Opendoor is something similar, and so it's a little bit harder to be a customer. I took Uber every day. You probably use Airbnb a number of times a year. And so in some sense for some of those companies, you can bill for yourself, you would intuit the job to be done because you're just doing it for yourself. We don't necessarily have that context. And so a framework that forces us to be really thoughtful and intentional about how a customer might perceive our product is really helpful. The other thing that I like about it is the canonical version of it encourages you to think about the context in which the user's operating or the other things outside of your product that they might be going through.

(00:33:59):
And in our case, the home buying or selling journey often is a certainly multi-week, if not multi-month or multi quarter journey with a lot of complexity and a lot of conversations outside of our product. You may be talking to an agent, you may be talking to a friend, you may be driving around the city trying to find a house, and the framework is very flexible and encouraging of saying what is actually the job to be done of this user when they're thinking about our product and what is the context in which they're operating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
I'd love to go one level deeper to talk about how you actually implement it. Do you have templates of, you have a startup project as a blank, I blank, blank, blank? How do you...

Brian Tolkin (00:34:40):
I would say we're medium rigorous on template standardization or adherence. So we do have a template, the standard product review template talks about jobs to be done and has a section for what is the problem statement and what are the jobs to be done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:58):
And this is a doc that when you're coming to a product review, the person running it and coming is filling out this document?

Brian Tolkin (00:35:04):
Correct, pre-filling it up, sorry, pre-filling it out. And again, I think we are not sticklers about always using that template, but I think the beauty of a template is yes, it sets expectations of what you expect, but it's also just easier often for people to be able to work off something. And so yeah, it's part of our product review template and then part of our planning process as well. Because we've used it for a while. I think there's been an internalization of the culture where people will also just start commenting about it or writing about it and saying, hey, what is the job to be done here? Or what is the user trying to do? Which is maybe another colloquial phrase in it. And so, yeah, I think there's a cultural seeping that has happened.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):
From memory, just what is in this template. So what's the phrasing that you try to use for setting up a problem?

Brian Tolkin (00:35:55):
Yeah, yeah. I mean, the specific framing, I would have to go remind myself on the template itself, but generally it looks like context, problem, potential solution, risks, risks/premortal and measurement of success. And then we also try to bucket our product reviews by stage. So you could be in the ideation stage, which might look very different than at the very end of the process. Like, Hey, we're getting ready to ship speak now forever hold your piece. Those two artifacts will also be very different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):
Okay. So it's not as a blank the standard jobs to be done language, it's not exactly how you implement it's more just make sure we're thinking of it what is the problem for the customer? What is the context of their problem?

Brian Tolkin (00:36:47):
Correct. Yeah. Yeah, we're not math living our template.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
Okay, awesome. Any other tips or lessons about just working well with this concept of jobs to be done? Maybe when you come into Opendoor and like, hey everyone, we're going to be thinking this way. Is there anything there that would be useful to people if they're trying to operate this way?

Brian Tolkin (00:37:06):
Recognizing that correctly implementing a framework, any framework, but if you don't in particular, we can talk about takes a little bit of time and getting used to and understanding. And so I don't think you can just like, okay, we're going to make the template and then that makes the content better. That just takes people's content and they wedge it into the template. It's actually the cultural internalization of like, hey, this might be phrased as the job to be done, but is this actually the job to be done? Let's talk about why the customer might be in that situation or not be in that situation. Or I think the job to be done might actually be something else.

(00:37:43):
Or you might say, hey, the job to be done is maybe an early day version would be the job to be done is to get an offer from Opendoor. And it's like, well kind of, but the broader job to be done might be price discovery for the customer. And so you can have a rich conversation where it's like, well, one might be a little bit influenced by our business goals. I don't think you just run around and people are like, yeah, I'm going to sell my house, but my goal is to get an offer from Opendoor. And so that's like, okay, the template might be the same, but it's actually the content that takes a little bit of cultural instantiation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:21):
Got it. And it sounds like people talk from what is the job to be done that feels like a core part of the way you think about it. What is the job to be done? Just that language alone feels really powerful. Is there a resource or a book that you point people to help your team learn about the jobs to be done work? Is there one thing you find useful?

Brian Tolkin (00:38:38):
Not about jobs to be done. I do a lot more pointing people towards internal examples of where I saw other PMs maybe do as well or blogs and stuff. But your blog is a column when we pass around, not about jobs to done, but just about many topics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:56):
I'm flattered. Thank you.

Brian Tolkin (00:38:58):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
I really appreciate that. I was also thinking as you were talking, you're friends with Kayvon and jobs to be done on Twitter was quite the journey for them, traumatic for a lot of people. I think it went very far to the extreme of the-

Brian Tolkin (00:39:11):
Yeah. I think they're more dogmatic about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:13):
Very dramatic. And so I guess it's a lesson here, maybe don't take it that far.

Brian Tolkin (00:39:19):
Yeah. And I think it probably, and I don't know if Kayvon would agree with this, I imagine he would, the generalized version of you pick the right framework for the right job and if you say there's one framework to rule them all and this is the only framework that works and then of course every problem into it, then we chop.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:38):
The way I think about jobs to be done is exactly the way you're describing it where it's just think from the lens of the job to be done for our customers. So for my newsletter, what is the job to be done of my newsletter to help you become better at your job as a product person building product. And that actually ends up being really helpful. And it feels like that's the way you guys think about it at opening.

Brian Tolkin (00:39:57):
Yeah, absolutely. And you're crushing it by the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:00):
Thank you. So are you. You talked about, I'm going to go into another question to deflect your compliment. You mentioned that Uber, there's a million transactions happening every second, it's massive scale. Opendoor is completely different. You have very few very large transactions. Yeah. I'm curious how you do experiments, if you do experiments, do you do A/B tests? What have you learned about just how to think through low sample sizes plus A/B testing?

Brian Tolkin (00:40:29):
Yeah, very hot topic of conversation. We do A/B test. It is obviously the gold standard. And so we do as much as we can. Of A/B testing there are parts of our funnel and flow that have more volume than others. So top of quality testing easier than down funnels, A/B testing purely product or tech features easier than A/B testing processes, operational processes. But you're totally right. We are not doing hundreds of millions of transactions a year. And so experimentation can be more challenging. And so I think one way to think about it is A, acknowledge the problem, which just to say don't, and we've made this mistake many, many times, but don't just force yourself into A/B testing without running the power analysis and say like, hey, are we going to get results? What is the size that will detect and what is the runtime of that experiment?

(00:41:39):
And be honest, is that acceptable? A second lesson here, is there certain experiments that are important enough and it's hard to triangulate signal in any other way that you may say a six-month runtime is an acceptable outcome and we are going to start it in June and we will be smarter for it for 2025 planning and we're going to set it and forget it and we're grateful we did, and that's okay. But the only mistake here is thinking you'll get an answer in a month when you won't, and then pretending you do and then waking up a month later and being like, "Well, it was insignificant and this and that." We could have known that. And then the third thing is, and experimentation is all about increasing your conviction in the problem or the solution. So the generalized version of the statement is, if there are parts of your funnel or flow that are low end and you can't run a canonical A/B test, how might you otherwise increase your conviction in the solution that you're building?

(00:42:47):
And there turns out there are a decent number of other ways to do that. The first best, most obvious is talk to more customers. But there are other statistical techniques that again, aren't as rigorous or good, but may be possible. You may be able to use observational data, you review with diff and diff, you may be able to look at sister cities or twin cities. You may be able to segment by geo, you may be able to reduce your power and say, hey, we're going to run at 80% confidence for all of our experiments instead of this traditional 95% because that's a worthy trade-off. And if we're wrong one more time out of 10, that's okay.

(00:43:28):
You can do a long-term holdout to match your intuition. And so there's a lot of other techniques to hone your intuition. There's a lot of other techniques to build conviction and confidence. And so we try to be very creative on doing that. And then the last bit I would say is if you're not going to get significance, if there's no other techniques at your disposal, then sometimes you just got to trust your intuition and ship it. And if that's what you believe, then that's what you believed and you shouldn't spend time trying to get false precision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):
I want to spend more time on that last point, but real quick, the power analysis you talked about, there's people, don't know, there's calculators out there that you could just plug in, here's how much traffic I'm getting, here's how much of an impact difference I want to see, here's how long it'll take to find out.

Brian Tolkin (00:44:17):
Yep, exactly. Totally. And some of the calculators are great where you can also plug in the traffic and your acceptable runtime and it will tell you the minimum detectable impact and then you can gut check your own intuition. So you can play around with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:31):
Awesome. We'll try to link to one of those in the show notes. So, on the intuition piece, is there anything more there? Just like how you think about when you run the product team, just how you recommend people leverage intuition versus not. Because some companies are like, we're just going to trust the data. I don't really trust your opinion. You don't know this customer exactly. You talked about Opendoor, I'm not buying houses myself, so I don't know how much I can trust my intuition. Just what's your general advice to your product team of how to think about their intuition and when to rely on it versus not?

Brian Tolkin (00:45:06):
So, at Opendoor, for example, I'd say on the relative spectrum, we're quite data-driven. And then it's when we come into this challenge where we say, okay, that is another technique or tool in the toolbox. I think the generalized version of that is customers, products, people can surprise you. And so this happens all the time for people who build products. I'm sure you've got great stories from Airbnb where you saw something, put it out there just was very-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):
All the time.

Brian Tolkin (00:45:36):
All the time. And so I think there's definitely a humility to say if you can, if it's relatively easy to test your assumptions or test your hypotheses. That is always better to gut check yourself. And that takes a little bit of humility to say that, but we've all been wrong plenty of times. But if that's just not on the table, I think the reality is you can't pretend it is. And sometimes you got to use taste and judgment and then you say, okay, what is my conviction level and do I have just medium, low or high conviction? And if I have anything low or medium conviction and it's a decision of consequence, I should talk to more customers, check it with another person and see if their intuition matches. Something that gets me personally to the high bucket category.

(00:46:27):
And then I think the last part, which is some part of experimentation is if you just ship something because it's your intuition or it's where you want to see the product go, do you have a reasonable feedback loop to understand whether or not you are correct? So that could be customer support or ticket volume or feature adoption, whatever the case is, it may not be an output metric in the traditional A/B test, but some more rigorous system that says, hey, I had this hypothesis, we just shipped it for x, y, z constraint reason for red.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:04):
I think that's awesome advice. I agree with everything you're saying. You mentioned this word humility, and it is a good segue to something I want to talk about, which is Zillow. One of the most interesting things that's happened in your space is Zillow basically decided, hey, we're just going to do what Opendoor is doing, they launched it, you're basically frenemies for a while, and then they're like, no, it's not working. Now you partner and now you work with Zillow on this stuff. So are you able to share what went down there with the story of what happened, how it went, and where things are at now?

Brian Tolkin (00:47:36):
Yeah, I mean we do partner with Zillow. Zillow's been a fantastic partner for us and we've really enjoyed a working relationship with them. I think when you think about it, they have tremendous amount of reach and audience and all these online platforms have tremendous reach and audience. And we happen to have a fairly unique selling solution. And so there's a nice, not to use a business school word, but there's a nice synergy so to speak, between a high intended audience who's doing a lot of browsing and searching and discovery and starting their process on one of these online platforms and what we offer, which is transaction services that allow people to actually move particularly on the seller side. And so there's just a pretty nice symbiotic relationship there with the Zillow's and the regimens of the world. And so both of those have been great partners for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):
What do you think Zillow maybe underestimated or didn't get about the space that made it harder than they anticipated? That seems obvious. Of course, let's go down funnel, let's just do it all. And they're like, "Oh, shit, not working." What do you think they didn't get or what do you think they missed?

Brian Tolkin (00:48:58):
I guess continuing on the humility point, I won't necessarily pretend to be in their shoes, but I will say the business is challenging and it's complex from a number of different dimensions. It's not a traditional software only product, but you have to be really good at pricing. You have to be really good at product, you have to be really good at the operations. You have to be really disciplined at risk. You have to be really good in the capital markets. And so you have to put all of these functions together to build a vertically integrated product. And that's the reality. And so that is something that's been in Opendoor's DNA from day one because we started with a vertically integrated product. And so we can't deliver unless we have all of those things. Right? And so I think that's something that continues to help us to this day, is that vertical integration requires all of those pieces coming together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):
That makes a lot of sense, and I think it's a good reminder of there are adjacent markets and businesses that always feel like, "Oh, we could expand to that someday." Such a big opportunity, this business could be so much bigger. And then you realize your business is completely not set up to operate this way. Zillow is very software driven, just I am not going to simplify what they do, but it's a website, very software. And obviously as we talked about Opendoor, a huge operational component. And then as you said, the pricing piece and the debt stuff.

Brian Tolkin (00:50:24):
Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):
Yeah. So I think it's a really good reminder that just when you're taking on something completely different, it may not fit into the way your company operates and partnering makes sense. Anything else there that's interesting to share around the Zillow thing? I guess one is maybe it was just like, I imagine it was very stressful. Zillow's getting into it. "Oh, shit what are we going to do? They got all the traffic." Yeah, anything there?

Brian Tolkin (00:50:46):
Yeah. I mean, it's certainly stressful. I think in general we try to live by whether Zillow or anybody else being competition aware, but not necessarily competition focused. And the reality is vast, vast in our space. A vast majority of people still move the traditional way. And so this isn't something where it's like the size of the prize isn't particularly large enough short or anything like that. The reality is it's the largest asset classroom in the United States, and if we just stay super focused on, hey, who are the customers that we serve really well that we talk to every day, there's a little bit of confidence that comes from being able to stay focused on that regardless of the competitive environment, again, because it's not like the market is fully saturated.

(00:51:40):
This is the same thing back in the Uber days as well. It's like transportation is almost infinitely large. And so, yes, it feels like there's heated competition between Uber and Lester or whatever back in the day, but the reality is there's plenty of trips that happens and people need to get around sitting in plenty of different ways. That's neither Uber and more Lyft. And staying focused on how you can develop for your customer, I think is the best way to focus.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:11):
There's a podcast that will come out before this episode with Jeff Weinstein from Stripe who's building Stripe Atlas. They had a similar experience with AngelList launched a direct competitor to Atlas, and then they realized Atlas is so much better. Forget it. We're just going to send everyone to Atlas.

Brian Tolkin (00:52:29):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:30):
Yes. And I think it's the same exact lesson that if you just stay focused on jobs to be done, let's say, of what is the job to be done and do the best possible job, and knowing that the market is much bigger, that you're not really competing with someone else, another company, it's the default behavior in your case. It's like people are just buying their house the old-fashioned way. That's the actual competition.

Brian Tolkin (00:52:51):
Exactly. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:53):
Yeah. Okay. So, along these lines, something else I've heard that you're very good at is staying very calm under pressure and staying very levelheaded when things are really crazy. This is something that a lot of people are not good at, especially leaders. They stress everyone out things. You go crazy, they don't create a good vibe. And then two, something people want to get better. Leaders and non-leader are like any lessons, anything you've learned about just how to develop this skill?

Brian Tolkin (00:53:18):
I think part of this may have been sharpened in the early days of Uber. Everything felt like a fire drill all the time. So the only way to operate, but I think you almost hit the nail on the head in the question, which is a little bit of an intellectual answer of when you reflect the stress onto your teams, everybody tenses up and tightens up. And so it counterintuitively doesn't produce better outcomes. And so I think the other reality to remind ourselves, and these are a bunch of mantras that just are helpful in these moments, is you're never as good as you think you are. You're never as bad as you think you are. And so that more even keeled demeanor, I think allows you to have a clearer head when you're operating under the pressure and to think more clearly.

(00:54:14):
I think one of the maybe least helpful answers, but unfortunately, the reality is you got to be in some stressful situations to also have the perspective that cycles past the things past. And that remaining calm is what matters. And so maybe the advice there is reflecting on one of these situations happen, exposing yourself to them, not running from them and then learning from them so that the next time it comes around you can say, Hey, I've been here before. I've slept on the floor in China before launching uberPOOL and thinking we're going to miss a launch deadline. And what were the tools in my toolbox and my toolkit that showed me that in terms of getting it done or not, and what were the lessons?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:06):
I love that. So part of it is just go through this experience many times and you'll start to realize, okay, it's not actually going to be as bad as people may think. You mentioned this toolkit instead of tools. Is there anything else there that you come back to that ends up being helpful? You mentioned this mantra of it's never as bad as people think it is, it is never great as people think it is.

Brian Tolkin (00:55:23):
Yeah, I mean, I think exposing yourself to other people's stories or however you may learn is really, really helpful. So again, whether it's your podcast or books or biographies or one of the podcasts that I love is Founders Podcast, which talks about historical famous entrepreneurs. And obviously these are elevating very famous people already, but there's a lot to learn from a lot of these stories as well and understanding that the journey in pack is nonlinear, it never is for anybody. And so I think being able to expose yourself to other stories that even may if you don't have those personal experiences and then understanding how others navigate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:11):
Got it. So just hearing of other people's crazy experiences and building on this muscle of like, okay, they've gone through crazy stuff, things work out.

Brian Tolkin (00:56:18):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):
We'll make it through. Okay. I have this note here that I think either someone mentioned about you or you may have mentioned that product is finding the kernel of truth in a sea of ambiguity and signals. Does that mean anything to you?

Brian Tolkin (00:56:33):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think in most organizations and to do the job effectively, you're going to get signals from everywhere and good ideas come from everywhere. It may be your CS team or CX team. It may be a customer directly. It may be a conversation you had. It may be a YouTube video you watched that sparked an idea. It may be feedback from an executive, it may be whatever. You went out and did a field visit. You are going to get a lot of inputs around what people think about your product, what people think you should do next. And I think that the core job is to understand what really matters, right? What is noise? What is a good idea, what is a suggestion and what is back to the jobs to be done for what is really going to move the customer forward?

(00:57:24):
And unfortunately that means saying no to maybe what sounds like some good ideas along the way, but if you can really figure out this is really what matters, that's the core part of the job. It dovetails even back to our earlier conversation. In the early days of building tech and ops companies is where's the tech leverage? Same question, where's the kernel of what really matters that tech can uniquely solve? And let's go do that and be comfortable with other fires maybe burning. That's what really, really, really matters. It's a hard discipline.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
I love that. If there's not an example, that's totally fine, but when you talk about this finding this kernel where tech could be highly leveraged, is there any example that comes to mind of that working out really well?

Brian Tolkin (00:58:13):
I mean, I think back in the Uber days, I think it was like, hey, we're not going to build sophisticated tooling infrastructure. We're not going to build a centralized growth team. We're not going to build any of that. Because if you think about the early Uber network from the simplest form, you've got a rider and a driver and you need to connect them, price the transaction and issue some receipts probably and collect payment. So it's like, okay, do we do that really well? And until we do that really well, all the other stuff is noise. It's immaterial how efficiently we answer support tickets. That's not critical. And so now it's super critical, but in the early days it's not that critical. And even the customer acquisition costs may not be super critical, in this case it's growing rapidly on the things. And so pouring fuel on the fire may not be super efficient there.

(00:59:13):
So I think that's a very good generalized example. One other tip that maybe is helpful that I frankly constantly work on and try to get better at is all these ideas and feedback that comes from everywhere, make sure it's written down for a number of reasons. One, you can then go reference it, but two, part of the job is making sure the people who present those ideas are heard and respected and know that it's at least somewhere where it was considered. And then you can look at it all and say, okay, but what actually really, really, really, really matters here? And yeah, that's another tip.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:55):
When you say written down, is there tools you find really helpful here? Is it just put it in a big doc that we're keeping? Is there anything you find to actually operationalize that?

Brian Tolkin (01:00:03):
I've seen different companies do it differently, but wherever you tend to try and keep a backlog, whether that's a Google sheet or your actual backlog in Jira, whatever you use, but at least it feels like, okay, the context was captured, and the idea is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:19):
Awesome. Okay. I'm going to take us to a recurring segment on this podcast called Failure Corner.

Brian Tolkin (01:00:25):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:26):
Is there a story you can share of a time you failed in your career had a big failure, and how that experience made you better?

Brian Tolkin (01:00:35):
We can talk about the very early days of uberPOOL, and the first launch, if you will in San Francisco. So, carpooling product, multiple riders in a Mercedes car. And we had this idea that it would be effective for commuters, this was very, very early days. And so part of the launch was, okay, we're going to beta it with just some popular commuting corridors with specific companies or maybe the marina to Google or whatever and try and match people according to what their companies and that's how we'll drive liquidity. And we very quickly realized that back to what the kernel of truth is here is liquidity is the only thing that matters. And there just wasn't enough. There was never going to be enough to do this company based thing. That wasn't the strategy that was going towards from us. And so the reason I don't know if it's a full failure is maybe this is true all failures, you learn from it, you pivot and you go on to the next thing.

(01:01:52):
And obviously we did that and then spent a lot of our time and effort trying to say, okay, what are the bounds of liquidity and driving liquidity that we can do to understand what the most important or what the limits of the product are. So as an example, we launched and maybe people in San Francisco. Remember this $5 anywhere in San Francisco, we work for promotion, which is obviously a great deal, obviously costs a lot of money, but the whole idea here is like, oh, okay, if liquidity is what really matters, if we were to juice that and really drive liquidity, how high can our metrics get? And then we can go chase more sustainable ways to do that. But it was a interesting fail case from launching and learning to say, hey, this initial strategy just isn't going to work, we got to go. And any part of it was a hedging strategy where with a small audience and there'll be a beta population, it's like, well, this one you just got to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
I think a lesson there is also don't overthink it, don't try to get too cute. Just like we're trying to make a perfect beta test versus realizing, okay, we just need a lot more people in it. Also, your $5 promotion made me think of the early promotions of the ice cream and the bunnies delivery and all that stuff.

Brian Tolkin (01:03:13):
Yeah. That was by the way, a example of fully distributed, the benefit of having those early Petri dishes. Someone a local marketing manager like, Hey, this would be fun. Yeah, that would be really fun. The platform can support it. And those promotions were fantastic. And it started out, I can't remember if the first one was ice cream or puppies, I think it was ice cream. But yeah, branched into all sorts of stuff. Boats, ice cream, puppies, kittens, I think, and all credit goes to local ideas of inspiration just being focused on trying to grow within.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:56):
I love that we've circled back to the beginning of our conversation, product and ops working together, the benefits of both. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any last nuggets of wisdom that you think might be useful to people when they're trying to build product companies teams?

Brian Tolkin (01:04:13):
This was great. We covered quite a bit of ground. I think the only, I don't know if this is a generalized wisdom, but something I've been thinking about as my career has progressed a little bit, especially building out proper organizations, especially as more tools come online, it's very clear that there's different types of PMs and we spent a lot of time talking about once we can operate in the physical and the digital or the product and operations worlds. But even within that, there's more technical PMs who grew up in minute engineering discipline. There are people who came from ops and there are people who came from design and grew up in a more user experience background.

(01:05:01):
And one thing that I've been moved on as is build out the team is thinking similar to a product roadmap is it's not really about is this person good or bad or whatever, it's is this person's skillset and context to the problem that is really needed. And so back to that conversation on, hey, where do we get tech leverage? It's like, Hey, is this person who has this unique skillset as a PM for this problem type? I don't know if that's helpful, but it's something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about, especially this view job posting niche view product manager. Or it's actually like, well, how can we be a little bit more thoughtful about what the actual skillset needs off this type of team?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:47):
Awesome. It's like a person product fit.

Brian Tolkin (01:05:50):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):
And I think it's because a lot of companies hire generalists and they're just like, we'll hire someone smart, ambitious, and with experience and general experience and then we'll put them on different things. So I think these are two different philosophies and it probably makes a lot of sense for an Opendoor with very unique type of business, with very specific skills that are necessary to be really good there. Okay, amazing. Brian, with this, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Brian Tolkin (01:06:16):
Let's do it. Can't wait.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:17):
Let's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Brian Tolkin (01:06:23):
Shoe dog, Black Swan, Design of Everyday Things, and for a fun one, Shawn Theron.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):
Amazing. Four books for the price of two to three. I love it.

Brian Tolkin (01:06:40):
Apologies. I'll stick to the rules.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:42):
No, no, there's no rules. There are no rules.

Brian Tolkin (01:06:45):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Brian Tolkin (01:06:50):
I like the sports docu ones on Netflix, so Full Swing, Drive to Survive, Break Points, tennis, golf, F1, all of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:02):
And wasn't there that Nike documentary recently with Ben Affleck?

Brian Tolkin (01:07:05):
There is, which I have not seen. So if it's good, I don't know if that's a recommendation or just an acknowledgement.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):
It's worth watching. If you like Shoe Dog, I feel like you'd enjoy it. It was entertaining Michael Jordan, things like that. Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love?

Brian Tolkin (01:07:24):
So we just got a puppy and we are about to have our first child. And so all of my purchases recently are puppies and children focused. My buddy gifted us the Phi collar for our dog, and so we've been really enjoying that. Another one as I'm getting busier for news and stuff is Particle, which is a great news aggravation tool, AI news tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:54):
Cavan's wife's business. I am a huge fan, actually I think it just came out of beta and now it's like a full app that anyone can download. I just actually installed it yesterday again and I love it. I get these pushes every few... I don't know, it's like a couple of times a day of just like, here's what's happening. Also, congratulations I should have said on your pending child.

Brian Tolkin (01:08:16):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:17):
Lucky for you. I have a newsletter post with all the products you should buy, it's called New Parent Gift Guide for Product Managers.

Brian Tolkin (01:08:24):
Love it. I will definitely probably buy all of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):
If you don't already have them all. And now everyone's probably sending you their spreadsheets of all their favorite stuff there.

Brian Tolkin (01:08:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with people either in work or life?

Brian Tolkin (01:08:41):
Well, mostly just stay curious.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:44):
Stay curious. I love it. Two more questions. Who has most influenced you in the course of your career?

Brian Tolkin (01:08:54):
One of the people who inspired me very early on in my product journey. I've been fortunate to have a number of very good mentors and obviously we talked about earlier while I was founders of books or me a lot from other people's journey. But one person who was personally important to me early in my product journey and very supportive of this guy named Jeff Holden, who was the chief product officer at Uber back in the day, and is like a young PM transferring into product really took me under his wing. And I think I'm forever grateful for that, for Jeff, for helping grow my career, but also try to pay it forward a little bit in terms of people who are going in the career. That was really meaningful for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:42):
Last question. I hear that your interview at Uber was pretty wild. Can you tell that story?

Brian Tolkin (01:09:48):
Yeah, I can. So, long story short, I was starting a company my senior spring before graduation and we had to go our separate ways. So I hadn't done traditional recruiting ever. And my buddy called me up and was like, "Hey, we're looking for smart, hardworking people at this Uber thing. Are you interested?" And quick side note, I had actually done some very early diligence work on these taxi apps back in 2011, looking at the time was Uber Cab and Cabilis and Taxi Manage can probably names nothing these days. And so I knew what Uber was and so I said, "Yeah, sure, I would love to." And so I had the first round of interview went well, and they said, great. And at that stage is come on onsite, the full enchilada one works, and this was post-graduation and was helping out some companies but didn't have a full-time job.

(01:10:51):
So I said, hey, I'm pretty flexible. How about next Tuesday? I said, great. So we scheduled it and then on Friday or Saturday or over the weekend I looked, I'm like, oh, Tuesday's, July 4th. I scheduled my interview for July 4th. And so I called my buddy and I'm like, hey, I am so sorry. I don't want to make people in on July 4th. Should I cancel? Should I reach out? Everyone's accepted. Whatever you do, do not cancel your interview. Like, okay, I'll be there on July 4th. And so I went in to the office on July 4th and there was a very small handful of people there. It was actually launching that day, was launching Uber's second ever product type, which was Uber SUV. And I had this, I think it was probably five hour gauntlet interview on July 4th from noon to five and missed my July 4th barbecue. And it was quite the experience, but I think maybe set the stage for some of the early days chaos. I'm very glad I didn't cancel the interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:58):
And was Travis involved in that interview or is it just-

Brian Tolkin (01:11:59):
Travis was involved in the interview. She was one of the... I think there were four or five people, and the two who were generally guiding my interview process and Travis and one other person starting that day. And part of the gauntlet interview was a simulation of the job, if you will. And so some of that was building some novels on the computers and some of it was writing potential emails to drivers and if she had the driver come in and you did chat, so I was in this room by myself typing away on the first part, which was building the model. And I hear him knock on the door and Travis comes in and he just sits down and says, "Hi, I'm Travis." I don't know who you are, but I'm Brian, and we have a 45-minute chat, or maybe it's been about half hour, 45 minutes. And clearly I'm not producing the work that I'm supposed to of the interview.

(01:12:59):
I'm supposed to be building this model. I'm supposed to email it back to the person who sent it to me. Clearly I've done nothing chatting with the CEO. And I hear a knock on the door and the door opens and the person sees that I'm talking to Travis, "Oh, continue, continue" and it was very good. Also, pretty intense conversation with Travis that definitely set the expectations working there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:24):
And clearly worked out. And Travis was happy. Is what-

Brian Tolkin (01:13:28):
I hope so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):
... I imagine.

Brian Tolkin (01:13:29):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
Amazing. Brian, thank you so much for being here. We went through everything that I was hoping to get through. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, and is there anything you want them to check out that you might be up to? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Brian Tolkin (01:13:44):
Super kind. They can find me online on Twitter, LinkedIn, both just Brian Tolkin, my name. In terms of being useful, if you have a home to sell, feel free to go on to Opendoor. More importantly, if you have feedback on the product, but would love to hear it. Otherwise, any feedback on what people liked or would love to learn more about from what we chatted about would be super great. So I'd love to hear from you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:09):
Brian, thank you so much for being here.

Brian Tolkin (01:14:12):
Lenny, I really appreciate it. This was great. Bye everyone.

# Inside Canva: Coaches not managers, giving away your Legos, and embracing AI | Cameron Adams

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Canva is bigger than Figma and Miro and Webflow combined. You guys are generating $2.3 billion in ARR and you're profitable. You're also growing 60% year over year and it's accelerating.

Cameron Adams (00:00:12):
I run everyone through the culture of Canva. One of those sections is on giving away your Lego, finding joy in the other things of building a team, passing on your experience, helping other people do great writing or great product building or great engineering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
When is this coaching concept? I've never heard of this.

Cameron Adams (00:00:27):
We don't really have managers, but everyone at Canva has a coach. They're constantly working with you to look at your skills, but also when it might be time to move on to the next level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
I'm curious just how you think about product management.

Cameron Adams (00:00:39):
I didn't want to do product management like they did at Google, and that's because of the different cultures. I have seen product managers at other companies who are very independent of teams and that seems very weird to me. For us, product managers are really connected.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
It feels like Canva has just been this non-stop up into the right all win, all success. In reality, that's never actually the case.

Cameron Adams (00:00:56):
How many failure stories do you want? We got plenty.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Cameron Adams. Cameron is the co-founder and chief product officer at Canva, which is a truly incredible business and company. At the top of the episode, I share a bunch of stats. They'll probably surprise you about the scale that Canva has reached these days.

(00:01:19):
In our conversation, we cover a ton of ground including how Canva stays product obsessed, their freemium strategy, lessons about building MVPs, how Cam and the product team think about AI within their product, also peek into their unique team culture, their SEO and growth strategy, and also peek into some of the stuff they just launched.

(00:01:37):
This episode is for anyone building or growing a product or company, and I guarantee by the end of this conversation, you'll be as blown away with Canva as I am. With that, I bring you Cameron Adams. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

(00:02:01):
Cameron, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Cameron Adams (00:02:04):
It is so great to be here, Lenny. I'm very excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:07):
I'm even more excited. I have at least a billion questions for you. I'm hoping I get through at least half a billion. There's so much I want to talk to you about, but I want to start with a warm and fuzzy question. Do you ever just take a moment to reflect on the insane success of this business that you've built? And before you answer that, I'm going to share some stats about Canva that I think are going to blow people's minds. So think about the answer.

(00:02:30):
So I was researching Canva, all of this was just... I didn't know any of this actually, and I think it'll surprise a lot of people just the scale that Canva has reached at this point. Okay. So Canva is bigger than Figma and Miro and Webflow combined both in terms of valuation and in terms of revenue. You guys are generating $2.3 billion in ARR per year and you're profitable. You've been profitable for about seven years at this point. You're also growing 60% year over year and it's accelerating, faster than last year. I think this is all quite unheard of at this scale. Do you ever just reflect back on this and, like, "Okay, I've done well."?

Cameron Adams (00:03:11):
When you say it all like that, it sounds pretty amazing. I don't think every day you're cognizant of that growth and that achievement, but there are particular moments where you get to really reflect, and for me, it's most of the time when we bring the team together. Obviously now we're in a pretty virtual world, hybrid in some best cases. But when the team all get together and we celebrate is when we finally have those moments where you get to step out of yourself, look at this huge sea of people and realize what you've achieved together.

(00:03:48):
Probably the most recent moment we got to do that was for our 10th birthday last year. So Canva is largely centered in Australia. We've got lots of offices around the world, but we had a big birthday celebration in Sydney right on the harbor there in front of the water and we had thousands of people there, and we just got to look back on everything we've achieved over the previous 10 years, and that was the pretty amazing moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:11):
What about just personally, you basically went from a designer on Google Wave to a co-founder of one of the most generational successful startups in the past decade. How does that feel?

Cameron Adams (00:04:24):
I still think I'm constantly growing, I'm constantly learning stuff. I don't feel like I've achieved a ceiling or being a massive smash hit. We're always changing how we're doing things. We're always doing things we've never done before and we feel totally like a fish out of water. So yeah, I've achieved a few things personally, but I still feel like there's so much more to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):
That sounds right. I want to talk about the flip side from the outside, like I described, it feels like Canva has just been this non-stop up into the right all win, all success, just killing it all the time. In reality, that's never actually the case. It's often really helpful for people to hear a story of, okay, there's actually this moment of this may be all falling apart or a struggle for yourself. Is there a moment that comes to mind of just like, "Oh, man, this was really scary and hard for me."?

Cameron Adams (00:05:17):
I think there's probably a few different stories that would resonate with your audience because there's like business kind of stories of how the actual company's tracking. There's product stories of stuff we launched that didn't go anywhere. There's team stories where you're dealing with people and all the different quirks that entails. I think I'll choose a business story. There was a moment around our 100 million valuation mark where we were putting together around... We had a lot of existing investors who were really keen to invest. This is probably our third or our fourth round by this stage, and it was all looking good. There was a particular investor who was really to lead out. We were fine with that. They were doing due diligence, got to the stage where every other investor in the round had signed on. They were super excited. They'd wired the money into our bank accounts already. They'd signed all the long docs but lead investor.

(00:06:15):
And about two days before they were due to sign and get all the money into our account, they came back and said, "Look, business is going great, but essentially we think we can get a better deal, so we're going to cut your valuation by 50%." It was a huge surprise and totally screwed up the entire round. All the other investors were like, "What the hell are you doing?" My co-founders, Mel and Cliff, pretty much jumped on a plane that night to go to Silicon Valley, rallied around a whole bunch of other investors, found a new lead investor, took them about a week. This was the week right before Christmas. It was incredibly stressful, incredibly tumultuous.

(00:07:05):
We eventually came out of it better. We actually got better terms on the deal that we came up with. That investor has fallen to the wayside now and it was a real learning moment for us in terms of how to approach fundraising and also how to be totally independent, and that's one of the reasons why we've focused on profitability for so long now. We've been profitable to spend the seven years and one of the reasons is that we never want to be put in the situation where we have to go to someone for money to ensure the survival of the business, and being profitable means that we never have to do that. We can always do it on our own terms and in our own time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:49):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making a fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.

(00:08:11):
Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.

(00:10:01):
Something that I've heard from one of your investors actually will not be named is that at your board meetings, you have one slide on the financials of the business and then the rest of the deck is product updates, the roadmap. I think this is very rare, especially for companies at your stage that become really focused on financials in the business from the CFO perspective and a lot of founders lose sight of the product. Can you just talk about this element of how you all think about the product that's so central to the business?

Cameron Adams (00:10:32):
I think one key thing is that we don't know it's very rare. We approach a board meeting just like we do anything, we craft the experience about how we think it should be and how we think it's going to be useful. So just like our board meetings or our product meetings or the way that we do launches, we have shaped that in the image that we want it to be and in the way that we think it's going to be most effective. We've always been an incredibly product-led company. We always think first and foremost about the product. That was the whole genesis of Canva itself, having a product that we thought people would love to use and desperately needed to get out into the world and that's the lens that we approach everything through.

(00:11:13):
In terms of board meetings, I think it's been very helpful that our financials and our growth have been amazing for so many years that we don't need to focus on it and we can just have that one slide with the graph going up and to the right. We've also attracted investors who believe in us and who understand that us driving product and getting as much product value out to our customers is probably the most important thing we can be doing. So that's why the board meetings do focus on that because what we are launching in the product, what's ahead is really determining the success of the company. Obviously, financials are important and you can do a bunch of lever pulling and thinking about margins and all that kind of stuff, but product is at the end of the day the most important thing to Canva and the thing that's going to help us stand out and continue to have success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:02):
I really like this point you made about how you didn't know any better almost, and it reminds me of something else I heard about Canva. It took you guys a long time to hire outside execs. Almost all your leaders are homegrown and it took you a long time to even hire outside of Australia. Its even higher in the US. Can you just talk about why that's been so important and just the impact that has come out of hiring people internally and helping people be promoted internally?

Cameron Adams (00:12:26):
One thing really focused on is team and culture. I think you can probably bring in the world's best person at X, Y, and Z, but if they're not fitting into your team and understanding your culture and have the same passion and vision that you do, they're not going to succeed. So it's super important that we have people along with us for the ride and that might mean everyone at Canva is awesome. They mightn't be the number one person in the world for that particular thing, but they get more done than the number one person could because they've built that trust and that safety with their team. They know how to communicate their ideas, they know how to bring other people along with them and lay out a vision in the way that we understand it at Canva, and that is a critical thing to building a great company, I think, is having that alignment across everyone, across your product teams, across your marketing teams, across your customer happiness.

(00:13:21):
They all need to be aligned and we all need to be rowing in the same direction. We have brought in leaders, and some of them have been incredibly successful. We have brought in leaders, and they've exited the company after a few months just because there wasn't that fit and they didn't manage to figure out or understand what Canva was and how to work within this big ecosystem. Now we've got 4,500 employees now and it's not just a matter of you coming in and bringing all your ideas. You also need to work together with all the other leaders that we have and the team that's surrounding you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:56):
As a lens into what is important. Canva, when you say that they didn't understand what Canva is, what's something that doesn't click for people a lot of times that forces them to be exited potentially? What is it that's so maybe unique or important to the way you all think about stuff?

Cameron Adams (00:14:12):
I have this theory that the type of product you're building very much influences the way that you think, and this stemmed out of a chat I was having with one of the product leaders at Spotify. And they said that at Spotify they do an incredible amount of talking about problems. They'll have a meeting, they'll talk about this new product feature and they'll just hash it out through conversation. And I imagined that that was because Spotify is a very auditory product. Everyone there thinks about music, sound, podcasts, that is their mindset. At Canva, we're all about visual communications. It's pitch decks, it's social media posts, it's video, it's t-shirts that you can make, and that's how we think about things in a very visual manner.

(00:15:01):
So one of the things that's very particular about Canva is really setting visions. And I'm in visions, not just in the sense of looking forward two, three years, but also visions in the very visual sense. We need to be able to see it. We need mock-ups. We need prototypes. You need to get that idea out of your head and present it to someone in a visual form that helps you talk about and communicate about it. That's one aspect of why some people I think don't land on their feet at Canva because they aren't necessarily visual thinkers and they don't end up communicating what they want to do in a visual way to the rest of people at Canva.

(00:15:38):
Another way is that the way that we've grown, the way that we've built product has been quite idiosyncratic over the years. And as I said, we've learned so much just through doing and established our own processes. And I think in any system, if someone comes up from the outside with preconceived notions or this idea that they're an expert and tries to bring that in, it's going to be rejected. So you really need to work together and I think the advice that I can give to people coming to Canva is just listen for a couple of months, figure out what is really working at Canva and why it works before you try and change it. We're very open to change and to new ideas, but just coming in wholesale and totally changing the process, just because that's what you've done somewhere else isn't going to get you the most level of success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:31):
That makes so much sense. We're talking about cultural elements and so I have one more question around culture. I saw a video interview you did once about how you love this concept of giving away your Legos, that's part of your culture and the culture at Canva broadly potentially, and this was originally popularized by Molly Graham in this first round review article. That's something you still believe in and if so, can you just describe that concept briefly because a lot of people haven't actually heard about this?

Cameron Adams (00:17:00):
Yeah, Molly wrote a great article, which I actually refer everyone who joins Canva to in the cultural onboarding session, which I give them. So I run everyone through the culture at Canva and what they can expect over the next few years as they work here, and one of those sections is on giving away your Lego, and it's really important to us because part of being in a startup is scaling, when you're scaling from zero users to a million to a hundred million, and when you're scaling from three founders to 10 employees to 100 employees to 4,000 employees. You're scaling everything from the product to the internal processes you have, the finance team paying people how you deal with user feedback. Everything's just constantly growing, growing, growing. And I think this is slightly different to a traditional job where you get good at the thing that you always do and you try and turn that into a process that just continually works all the time.

(00:17:58):
As a startup, you just have to be changing and we want people who are flexible, you can bring new ideas, you can go to that next level. You can think about not just a million people, but 10 million people, 100 million people, a billion people using the product, and to constantly ratchet up that multiplier, you need to change yourself, which means that you probably need to give away some of the stuff that you're doing now in order to get to that next level. If you're the first email copywriter at Canva, you can get away from writing all the emails for the first year maybe, but when you're writing emails for 100 million people in 190 different countries, in 100 different languages, all at different stages of their journey through using Canva from beginners to intermediates to experts, that just massively multiplies the complexity of the job that you have to do. And if you're trying to write every single one of those emails, you have no chance of scaling.

(00:18:56):
So you need to think about who you're going to bring in to help you, what systems you're going to introduce, what are the processes needed to get 100 different languages translated every time you send out an email and that requires you to hand off that stuff. You need to maybe stop writing every single email, give that to someone else, be comfortable with doing that because you often build up a lot of self-identity and doing that and you get a lot of joy out of it. That's why you're a writer in the first place. But finding joy in the other things of building a team, passing on your experience, helping other people do great writing or great product building or great engineering is really what giving away your Lego is about. And we still encourage everyone to do that, to think about those moments where they need to level up in their impact, how they can bring their team along with them, how they can pass on their experience and help everyone really have a tremendous impact with the skills that they have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:51):
I think a lot of people and a lot of companies struggle with this idea, and I'm curious if there's something you've learned about how to actually implement this. Is it just like, "Hey, go read this article and then I might bring it up sometimes when things are changing and there's a reorg."? Or is there anything even deeper of just this is a cultural element of we are constantly giving up our Lego's giving things that we own?

Cameron Adams (00:20:10):
Probably the deeper thing I think is giving people opportunity so you can talk about growth than just say, "Please grow." That's not going to be terribly effective, but giving them the opportunity and the support to do so is super important. We have a system we call coaching at Canva where you have a coach and they're constantly working with you to look at your skills, how you can improve each of those individual skills, but also what it is that you're actually doing and when it might be the time to move on to the next level. Say you are just doing a product role in this particular product and now you need to be a coach of other product managers and help build products. Understanding those pivot points is really important and our coaches help everyone at Canva. Everyone at Canva has a coach that is constantly thinking about this aspect of their personal growth.

(00:21:00):
And finding those opportunities where you can push someone to do something that they haven't done before or to expand upon an idea that they've had and give them ownership of that idea is super important. So when people do come to us with an amazing product idea or a feature that they want to build or an entire team that they think should be spun up, we really listen to them, and if it makes sense, we say, "Go and do that. Go and build that part of the product, grab a couple of people and start building video at Canva. Do that thing that you're talking about." And I think if you give them the opportunity and a little push to go beyond what they think they're comfortable with right now, that is the best way to drive growth in your team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:44):
Okay. There's two things I want to follow up on there. One is this coaching concept. I've never heard of this. So how does that work? Do they have a manager and they have coach, and who is this coach?

Cameron Adams (00:21:54):
We don't really have managers. So your coach is the person who thinks about you in a specialty sense. So we have specialties, engineering, product design, we got tens of different specialties across Canva, and your coach really helps.. Your coach is a similar specialty leads, so if you're a product manager, they're a product manager, so they know the skills that you have to use. They know the trajectory that you could possibly grow into. They know the structures that are around Canva that you could slot into when you want to go to the next level. And your coach constantly checks in with you, has sessions, might help you with the strategy doc, might have a one-on-one with you. They just constantly thinking about those ways that you can grow and improve at Canva.

(00:22:42):
And then we have probably more of a, I would say, collegiate managerial circle of colleagues who help you who do 360 feedback, all that kind of stuff. So that's the structure that we've arrived on and it's worked pretty well for us and it was driven actually by a formative coaching experience that we had as founders quite a few years ago from an external coach and we decided to bring that into Canva as a whole philosophy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:10):
And these coaches, are they professional coaches or they're people in the company that are like, "I will be a coach for this function."?

Cameron Adams (00:23:15):
They're people in the company. So we've got probably close to 800 or 1,000 coaches now at Canva.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):
Wow.

Cameron Adams (00:23:23):
We do have very specific coaches who are just coaches and they can drop into any situation. They're not product managers, they're not designers, but they're relatively few. I think, we've got probably five of those type of coaches and they just work in very special situations, but what we're focused on is enabling the broader circle of coaches, so those 800 people to understand what it is to be a coach and have the skills of coaching. So we focus a lot on teaching them the skills of coaching, how to build a growth mindset in their coaches, all the skills that you need. So yeah, it's a massive part of Canva.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):
And so there's a product management coach and this person helps all the PMs become better at the craft of product management.

Cameron Adams (00:24:09):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
Wow, so interesting. Okay, and then the performance review piece, how does that work?

Cameron Adams (00:24:13):
Yeah. So your coach feeds into that, but we also do 360 feedback from all the people that you work with and we do that on regular cycles. As with everything at Canva, the cadence of those cycles has changed over the years, but now we do that every six months.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:29):
We talked about product for a little bit. I want to spend a little time on product management. I'm curious just how you think about product management. There's this constant debate across tech companies about the value of PMs. Are we better with more PMs? Are there too many PMs? What do PMs do for you? You're a chief product officer. Where do you find product managers bring the most value to Canva? And then do you just have thought on the future of the field of product management?

Cameron Adams (00:24:54):
I don't know. It's one of those things that I don't want to quantify. I don't want to put it in a box and say this is product management. Because I've worked at a few places now. I've actually only had one real job, which was at Google where I got to experience product managers the Google way. And the way that they do product management is totally different to the way that we do it at Canva, and that's partially by design because I didn't want to do product management like they did at Google, and that's because of the different cultures that they have. Google's a fantastically engineering-driven culture and the way that they think about product management is mostly in the technical sense of like, "Here's a piece of technology, what can that technology do, how do we scale it?" At Canva, we focus a lot on experience and as I said before, it's a very visual experience, so we require a different product management process, but also a different product management mindset.

(00:25:51):
I think we probably did that more from the ground up than a lot of other startups just because Mel and Cliff were a lot less, I think, inculcated into how product management has done other places. I had a bit of experience from Google but was still fairly independent in my thinking, so we almost went back to first principles on how product management should be done, and to be honest, we didn't want to have the term product manager for a long, long time. It wasn't until about year '06 or '07 where we actually had product managers, we decided to cave just because it was easier to explain to people.

(00:26:30):
But it also took us four or five years before we even had another product owner who wasn't us. Part of that was us giving up our Lego, and I think we took a little too long to give up our Lego on that one, but the other part of it was us figuring out exactly what we wanted and how we built product and how to communicate that to someone else and get them to do it in a similar way and work with the teams in the way that we did.

(00:27:00):
For us, product managers are really connectives. They connect the team, ideas, data, a whole bunch of different things, and it's very messy. There's no exact recipe for how to do it, but connecting these disparate areas and moving the team and the technology and our customers to a new place, a new vision is essentially what product managers do, and it's going to involve compromise, it's going to involve changes in the feature scope, it's going to involve timelines of like, "Okay, we can't ship it in May, it's going to have to be July. Let's figure out what we can do with marketing to make that work." This constant movement and connection and reorienting around the constraints that have suddenly arisen in the last week, and that's where we see great product managers operating in Canva.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:56):
You mentioned Mel and Cliff. For folks that don't know, they're the other two co-founders of Canva and they were dating when they were starting Canva, I think it was called Fusion Books back in the day before Canva. Now, they're married. What's it like working with a married couple as the other two co-founders, and is there something they did well that didn't make you feel like this third wheel person that isn't married to them?

Cameron Adams (00:28:22):
It is always tricky working with a couple because they're on it 24/7. When you leave the office and they head home, they're still talking about product, business strategy, all the things. I think they've done a really good job of evolving those ideas overnight through the conversations they have and over dinner and walking, but then bringing that back the next day and being transparent about that and that's super important. If you are working in that kind of dynamic. There are definitely moments where I have missed out on a memo and stuff has rapidly proceeded, and I think I've just gotten used to that and gotten used to catching up really quickly, having a word with them on the side to clarify what the motivation is here and just constantly maintaining that alignment.

(00:29:11):
And I think it happens in any partnership or team. There's moments where there's small alignments, there's more tectonic stuff that happens over months or years, and you need to realign at some stage. I think it happens with friendships, it happens with my wife, it happens with our product teams. There's always these moments where you need to re-communicate things and relay the land of it. And I think we've been great at doing that as co-founders even for the small things and also for the more tectonic things.

(00:30:37):
I'm going to go back to the beginning of Canva. I know that it took you guys a year of building before you launched it, so it took you a year to build the MVP essentially. And I know you have some strong opinions on how long to wait, how MVPs are often way too early. Can you talk about that just why you guys waited so long before launching clearly worked out and so I'm just curious your lessons from that experience.

Cameron Adams (00:30:59):
Yeah, so when we launched or when we were building the Lean Startup book came out, so that was all anyone talked to us about investors, other people building products, trying to give us advice. They were like, "Just get something out the door, as crappy as it is just to get in front of users." I think, for us, the product is the experience and giving people a great experience is an intrinsic part of the product. It's also an intrinsic part of how we've grown. People having a good experience of being enthusiastic about it has been how we've spread the word of Canva and organic word-of-mouth growth was the biggest driver of Canva's growth for many years and probably still is, I think. People just telling someone else to jump on this amazing product, I don't think we would've had that if we just put our pretty crappy product that people didn't have joy in using. Sure, it might've got the job done, but if they weren't excited about using it the next day, then that wasn't a bar that we wanted to hit.

(00:32:08):
So we did hold off on launching the product for a long time and investors did ask us many, many times, "When are you launching? Can you just get this thing out the door?" But we had done enough research, we knew the problem space, we knew what people wanted from the product. Part of that was due to the work that Mel and Cliff did on Fusion Books in a very constrained area. They had looked at school yearbooks, they had built an experience for that, and they had observed what worked didn't work and how they might scale that into a bigger product. It also worked for me who'd worked in a lot of creative tools and built a lot of creative tools over the previous 15 years. So I had a lot of understanding of how people interacted with these systems and the experience that we wanted to build.

(00:32:57):
So we did hold off and the product we launched launched, we obviously weren't happy with. You have to launch something that you're not completely happy with, all the rough edges, but you're releasing it knowing that the rough edges are going to be outweighed by the joyful experience. We still did a ton of user testing, right? It's not like we just launched this thing blind and said, "We hope people like it." We did a ton of user testing. We did a ton of user research into the features that people wanted, and we built that up over time. And one year to me actually seems like short time, a lot of people think it's a long time, but one year was just enough for us to scrape in with an experience that people did truly love when we launched, and particularly the market that we went after when we launched really loved it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:49):
I'm curious just what advice you share with founders when they're asking you how joyous does this first version have to be? How awesome does my MVP need to be? One thread I picked up as you were describing your experiences, you all had deep experience in this space, so you knew what you wanted to build. It wasn't like this dark forest of exploration is like we know what we want generally. Do you have advice you share with founders of how awesome their MVP should be and when it's worth spending a year or two or three building it?

Cameron Adams (00:34:20):
There's a couple of points in there. First is that even today we build for ourselves, and I think this is advice that probably a lot of product people wouldn't give you is that you shouldn't build for yourself, you should build for your customer. But I think we're fortunate that we are our customer and that the problems we experience are the problems that hundreds of millions, billions of people experience. I think that is maybe a fortunate part of just the problem area that we're interested in, but it has enabled us to move really quickly on the product because we can quickly know what's working in the product, whether this feature is useful, whether it's reached that bar of a great experience.

(00:35:03):
So that's one aspect of it and I think that is also about being passionate, you entering an area that you are extremely passionate about. I often hear people are like, "I want to do a tech startup. What is the best area I should focus on to build a product in?" And to me, that is totally the wrong way to go about building a company that you're going to spend the next 10, 20 years in because if you're in an area that you are particularly passionate about but you see the opportunity to make a bit of money or have some external measure of success, that is a terrible way to go about being a founder because you're going to hit these rock bottom dark places and if the passion isn't driving you through that, you're going to have an incredibly hard time getting to the next step. So that's probably the first area I talk about in terms of knowing when a product is amazing.

(00:35:58):
The second one is that it really needs to spark, joy, and delight in people and just pure excitement. It can't just be like, "Oh, yeah, this is a useful tool for me." It needs to light up their eyes. They need to be like, "How do I sign up for this thing tomorrow? How do I get it? How do I pay for it?" And they need to want to talk to other people about it because in the early days of your startup, you don't have marketing dollars, you don't have channels which you can go to immediately get access to a million people. You need to really foster the first people that are going to use your product and they're going to be the ones that are going to spread it and they're going to set the foundations for your growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:41):
Interesting. So piece of advice number one is work on something you really want yourself that you're excited to work on. Two is get it to a place where it lights up people's eyes. They're just so excited with this thing. For that second bar, what was it for Canva? Was it just that it was impossible to do this design in a browser?

Cameron Adams (00:37:00):
It was 2012, 2013 when we launched and visual content was still in its infancy. Instagram had only been out a couple of years. Pinterest was on the rise. People were just getting used to creating visuals and it was hived off to a very select few because to create those visuals you needed to afford some expensive software, know how to use that expensive software, nowhere to go to get fonts and photos and illustrations, know how to put that together into something that looked decent and then ship that off. It was something that only 1% of the world could do and democratizing design, empowering the world to design is Canva's entire mission, and we saw this sweet spot at the time in social media. It wasn't what we set out to go after. We set out to democratize design to bring design to literally everyone in the world and to everything that they're doing.

(00:37:59):
But through the user testing that we did, through the levels of excitement that we saw from different people, social media managers really came to the fore at that time. So we knew that they really fit what we could ship right now. We didn't ship a presentation product or a T-shirt builder in our very first version. We shipped a thing that could make square landscape and portrait graphics and blog post graphics, and that got a particular segment of society excited. We added on all the things afterwards because that was part of vision and ultimately what we wanted to build. But with a team of 10 people in the space of a year, building something that really got social media managers excited was what we could pull off. And that's something we realized in the last six months of that launch year. We didn't quite know who our audience was going to be. We knew it was a tool that anyone could use, but in that last six months of user testing and refining is when we really identified that first target market and we just leant into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):
There's so many things you all nailed early on. One of them is the focus persona/ICP, which is you said social media managers. Just to take the lesson from that, you basically saw that segment getting the most excited about the product and that told you, let's focus on this group. Is that right?

Cameron Adams (00:39:27):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:29):
And was it like an order magnitude more excited? What do people look for there that tells them, "This is the one."? What did you see there other than just more excitement?

Cameron Adams (00:39:39):
It was just incredibly emotive language, like sheer joy. Particularly coming into the product, we worked a lot on the onboarding process in the last couple of months of launch and that was really pivotal because the product features were there. You could add text, you could add images, you can change the color of things, you can move stuff around the page. It was a simple but powerful product, but there was this thing holding people back from actually using it and understanding what Canva could do for them. And when user tested the onboarding of Canva a ton, actually usertesting.com had just launched them, which really unlocked us because we didn't have to do these big formal labs or anything like that. We could just go online and get results in the space of half an hour. So that was like a pivotal unlock for our product process and that's something we still employ today.

(00:40:39):
And through that, we tailored the onboarding process to get people excited and to understand the deeper goal with Canva and the deeper impact it could let them have. It wasn't just about letting them put a pretty picture on the page, it really unlocked their ideas and let them do things they couldn't do before. And we shaped the onboarding to do that and it resonated the most with social media managers because they had this massive content need that they couldn't really service. And in the first minute of Canva with the right onboarding, it just unlocked the whole realm of productivity and impact that they didn't have before and that's why they got super excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:23):
We talk a lot on this podcast about the power of onboarding and the impact that can have on retention and everything down funnel. Do you remember what the unlock was in terms of and getting more people activated? Is there anything that's something that other people can learn from?

Cameron Adams (00:41:38):
For us, it was taking that first step, particularly with Canva and any I think creative tool. There's a real fear of the blank page. So prior to any onboarding thought from us, we had a blank page. We had a few coach marks that said, "Here's where you do this, here's where you do this." And then they'd be left on this blank page and people would freak out. So what we really focused on was just taking that first step and then the next step and then the next step. And before they knew it, they built a design. And the way that we did that was to encourage a really simple step. So the first one was click on this search box and search for a monkey. It literally said that.

(00:42:18):
Searching for a monkey is something you probably don't do in most tools. So it was a little surprising, which was a good inroad, but it was still super easy. Anyone can type monkey. And then you type that in, it comes up with this whole sway the monkey images, which look hilarious, and just dragging one of those out onto a page is another simple step. And we just got people to walk through that keeping their interest up, keeping the bar of effort quite low, but within three or four steps, they'd built up something that they'd never been able to do before, and it surprised them. The words that we literally got out of years at testing were, I didn't know I could be a designer. And that was what we managed to do through several rounds of refinement on the onboarding process. It is lowering the barriers to entry and also increasing the amount of delight, and I think those two things are what you should be aiming for with your onboarding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:16):
That's an incredible insight. Is there a video of that original onboarding out there or is the current one still similar?

Cameron Adams (00:43:22):
The current one isn't similar. We have constantly gone back to it because it performs really well. We do actually apply the same approach of little steps building up into bigger accomplishments, and that's actually rolled out through our last round of launches for the last couple of years through something we call learn and play. So with every launch that we do now, we think about how to teach people about that feature and how to get them really involved in it. We have a whole series of learn and plays where when we launch AI photo editing, they can try it out right then and there. They've got some great content that they can immediately operate on, and it's a super simple step for them to type in a prompt and see the result of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:05):
I think an interesting and really important takeaway here is you built a very delightful, incredible, innovative product, but it still didn't work until you figured out the onboarding and that you needed to figure out the persona to focus on. All those things end up being incredibly important, it's not just build something amazing and delightful.

Cameron Adams (00:44:25):
Definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):
Staying within this realm of growth, you've grown in large part thanks to this incredibly SEO template strategy. You mentioned in interview there's this guy, Andre that came on early and helped you figure this stuff out. Is that true? And if so, what was the key insight that he had that led to such a great success in terms of growth for you all?

Cameron Adams (00:44:49):
Andre is an amazing guy. He's actually been in and out of Canva three or four times now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):
Keep pulling him back.

Cameron Adams (00:44:56):
Yeah, keep pulling him back. We originally found him, he came from a startup that was going under here in Sydney. We had thought about SEO. We knew it was this thing that you could use, and I think in a couple of our pitch decks, we had SEO as a whole growth channel that we were going to execute upon in order for investors to make a ton of money, but we pretty much knew nothing about it. And it was sitting away in our backlog of things to do in the first couple of years of Canva. And we came across Andre and he just really crystallized what SEO was and how it would actually help us grow. So we brought him on, he rolled out his strategy and it was fantastically effective. It was also incredibly cheap, and it was super easy for us to do ourselves.

(00:45:51):
He set up a whole team of people who looked at people's motivations and the top jobs to be done that Canva could service. He then mapped that through the entire experience of going into Google, typing a search query, getting that search query, seeing that it was a great result, firstly getting to the top result, but then also the experience after they landed on Canva. So if they searched for want to make a Halloween poster, the top Google result would be Canva. They'd click on it, they'd land on the Halloween poster landing page. It would tell them how they were going to do, it show you how the product was going to do that, have a button there that immediately took them into a Halloween poster template, went through a fantastic onboarding of customizing that poster really simply, and then they would hit done, download the image, and they had a fantastic experience and he thought through that whole end-to-end flow from first landing on Google and typing into the search box through to that magic moment where they're like, "Canva just helped me do something amazing and I want to do it again."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:58):
Amazing. Okay. So a few things I'm hearing there. One is figure out the jobs to be done of potential users, figuring out where their search volume, figure out ones you can actually solve for them, like say a Halloween poster, and then think about that experience end to end from search to landing. And obviously, you have to deliver on that promise. You have to actually show them a really cool Halloween poster that they can create, right?

Cameron Adams (00:47:19):
Yeah. Again, it's like product led truly means product led because you can't just SEO the hell out of something that is a terrible experience. So tying that experience at the end of the SEO journey is just as important as the technicalities of SEO itself, and Andre really harnessed the whole spectrum of that to produce the end experience, which ultimately ended up with an active user having a delightful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):
Is there anything else along those lines that was really surprising to you or really, wow, that worked a lot better than I thought because it's probably one of the most well executed, most successful SEO strategies in history. And I'm so curious, just if there's anything else there that's just like, "Oh, wow, that was really effective and I didn't expect that."

Cameron Adams (00:48:05):
There's a ton in the SEO realm that Andre drove that can get quite technical. But I think one of the other pivotal growth moments for us was internationalization. I think as an Australian company, we're fortunate in that Australia isn't a great market to focus on. We've got 25 million people here. It's okay, but it's not sizeable. It's not going to make you a huge success. Whereas probably a startup that starts in the US will tend to focus on the US because it's a huge monetizable market, and you can entirely create a great company that just services the US. But from Australia, we needed to think about the world. And that meant that we very quickly got into internationalization.

(00:48:52):
We started localizing and internationalizing our products three years after launch, which is quite early compared to a lot of other companies. And we tackled it with real vigor. We had a goal of being in five different languages within the first year of localization, and we actually hit eight in that first year. And then we set ourselves a goal of being in 100 different languages the next year. And the internationalization team smashed that goal by the end of 2017. And it has drastically changed Canva's growth trajectory because being in other languages, offering a localized experience, something that people in Brazil or Indonesia or Spain or Poland can authentically feel like they're using a product that's made for them has totally changed who our market is, how quickly we can grow. And the way the product's used internationalizing into Brazilian Portuguese meant that we had to focus a ton more on the Android mobile experience, which was really different for us because we focused a lot on the desktop experience for the first four years.

(00:49:58):
People also in Brazil run entire businesses from their mobile phone and the types of content they're creating to interact with their audience is totally different. So it's actually shaped our product and changed our product trajectory as a result of thinking about internationalization. And it has just fueled tremendous growth. Brazil, India, Indonesia, they're all in our top five markets and they grow way faster than the US does.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:25):
I know you went international in your four, something like that, which is really early for a company. It also makes sense for SEO plus internationalization. Makes tons of sense.

Cameron Adams (00:50:35):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):
It's a lot more surface area. Okay. I'm going to have two more questions. One is around your freemium strategy. Another a thing you all nailed. There's just this, you're both seeing incredible growth and incredible monetization. I'm curious what your philosophy is on what to include in the free plan versus what people should pay for because it's clearly worked out great.

Cameron Adams (00:50:59):
Freemium for us wasn't so much a growth strategy or a monetization strategy as much as it spoke to our core mission of empowering the world to design. We truly want to democratize design, which means we want to get design into the hands of as many people as we can because we think that the world is a better place when more people can create really rich visual content. So freemium just made sense to us because we could get the tool into billions of people's hands and they wouldn't necessarily have to pay for it. And much of the world can't pay for products because they just don't have access to that level of income.

(00:51:36):
So providing that equality was really important to us. But also you need to build a viable business because you can't help the world design if you can't afford to keep the lights on. So freemium just really hit this sweet spot for us between philosophy and business building, so it was always part of our plan since day one. We initially had element sales as our business models. So when we first went to pitch Canva, it was all about create a design. Anything you use in that design will cost you a dollar. So if you dragged in a monkey and you wanted to export that whole design, you'd have to pay a dollar for the money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:14):
Yeah, I've done that many times.

Cameron Adams (00:52:15):
Yes. It was really exciting to investors at the time. It was also really exciting to the content creators who were giving us the monkeys to put into our product. It was a totally new business model. It unlocked, I think, an area that a lot of people were unfamiliar with, which was stock photography. Most people had not paid 100, $500 for photo, and that really held them back from being visual content creators. So it was a really unique innovation for us. And for the first two years of Canva's life, that was how we derived our revenue. It grew pretty well. It was still like, I don't know, 30% month-on-month growth in terms of revenue. But you can do that in the early stages of a startup. It wasn't until we introduced our first subscription product that we saw really hockey stick growth in our revenue. And that was always the plan to launch a subscription product.

(00:53:09):
But as with many things, it was a vision that we didn't quite have meat around the bones. So we knew we wanted to put in a subscription what exactly that subscription would look like. We didn't quite know. And through the first couple of years of Canva, we started noticing what people were asking for, what they would be more likely to pay in a subscription for. And that formed the first few features that became what was then called Canva for Work, which is now called Canva Pro. And we launched our first subscription, I think about three years after we launched the first product, and we just rapidly saw the revenue from the subscription start overtaking the $1 image payments.

(00:53:53):
So much so that three or four years later we made image element payments part of the subscription. And again, that was like a second hockey stick in gross in terms of the revenue from the subscription because all you can eat images inside the Canva Pro subscription with just amazing value add for people. And I don't even know if we get any revenue from image element sales now. It's all about just going into this subscription.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:24):
Amazing. Just hockey stick after hockey sticks. Speaking of another hockey stick, I want to talk about AI.

Cameron Adams (00:54:29):
Oh, a whole hockey team of hockey sticks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:32):
Just need to acquire hockey teams. I want to talk about AI, something on the top of everyone's minds these days. It's another area you guys have nailed. You're doing amazing work with AI. It's providing actual value and business impact. I hear you have an amazing internal AI ops team. Is there anything that you've learned so far that you can share about just how to integrate AI successfully and effectively into a product?

Cameron Adams (00:54:58):
As a technology company, you always just need to be constantly evolving and using the best technology. And when we started that was mobile phones and cloud computing. They were the innovations that came in that really unlocked Canva. AI is the next decade I think of innovation. It's the next pivotal piece of technology that helps you build better products, but it also can't just be the basis for your product. You can't just be a product that's purely built on AI on being a rapper around an LLM or something like that. You still need to think about what it is that people want to do and how you build a product that actually meets that need. It isn't just about slapping a chatbot on something that already existed. It's about deeply thinking about how AI can help them get to that goal even faster. And we view AI as the next way of democratizing design and empowering the world to design, helping more people design, helping more people design quicker, helping more people design quicker with better quality. And that's how we approach every aspect of including AI in the Canva platform.

(00:56:04):
We've had a team of machine learning engineers for probably seven years now. I think their work has become a lot more visual now and more customer facing way back when they were just doing recommendation engines inside our emails and our homepage and suggesting templates to you. But now they get to work with some really cool technology, which lets them produce images for people and create designs and summarize text and translate to a hundred different languages like it's really stuff that you can put directly in front of customers now, and that's super exciting. And over the last couple of years, we've built up more and more visual AI experts inside Canva, and we approach AI inside the product through three pillars.

(00:56:53):
First of these is that we need to build some of our own AI tech, and we focus on building the AI tech that we have the biggest advantage in that we have the most data that we can put into it, the most insights, the most criticality to our product and our business. So we have teams building our own AI models around design and images and that stuff. Second pillar is just finding the world's best AI people to partner with. And there's a whole bunch of stuff that you don't need to internalize in your company. You don't need to create an LLM because it's a commodity thing now. And there's a bunch of providers who can do it way better and have way more resources to do it with than you do. So finding a great partner like OpenAI, and we partnered with RunwayML to do video generation, finding the world's best and bringing them into your product with a great integration, the second pillar.

(00:57:48):
And for us, the third pillar is our app ecosystem. So we're fortunate now we've got 170 million people using the product every single month. We have quite an audience that people want access to. And through our app developer ecosystem, they can build apps which directly integrate with the Canva product to give them access to those hundreds of millions of people when people are quite eager to do that. Now, we've seen huge uptake in that from AI developers who have included stuff in Canva from music generators to virtual avatars that can present your presentation to you to a whole slew of things. And those three pillars have, I think, allowed us to create a really coherent experience and one that still keeps a focus on what people want to do, how to help them reach their big goals in a way that doesn't just push technology in the face in a way that just is part of the experience and is a natural way of getting them to where they want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):
I was also looking at the GPT story of the fifth most popular custom GPT where people can generate logos using it. So maybe that's driving some growth too. I know you wanted to share something that you guys are launching or have launched by the time this episode comes out. Is that true?

Cameron Adams (00:59:08):
Yeah, so we've got a big event in Los Angeles in a couple of months. It's our Canva create, which is an evolution of the season openness that we used to do. So season openers are no longer just inside Canva now. We actually invite our whole community in, and we're going to have probably about 4,000 people in the theater in LA and a couple of million online. And we're really going to be pulling the covers off pretty much the next decade of Canva. We've focused for the first decade of Canva on unlocking individuals and small businesses, giving them the tools that they need to design and to express themselves and create visual content. And as Canva has grown and people have gotten used to creating this stuff, they've invited their teams in, they now collaborate with people on presentations, on Canva videos, on swag T-shirts that they need to make for their event next week.

(01:00:06):
And as more and more people are using Canva together, it's picking up a lot of steam. We've got 95% of the Fortune 500 using Canva. We've got huge teams of thousands of people using Canva. And this has really opened our eyes to not only the enterprise opportunity, but also just the way to redesign the way people work. And that is what the event at the end of May is about. It's really redesigning work for a whole number of different verticals, from marketing to sales to HR to IT to creatives that work inside large teams, large organizations, large enterprises. We've redesigned Canva for this collaborative enterprise age, so we'll be pulling the covers off that alongside work kits, which are a whole verticalized experiences for people inside marketing and sales and HR that want to use Canva, as well as a bunch of improvements to our AI products and an actual enterprise skew that we're launching as well.

(01:01:13):
So through this growth and through getting to understand the needs of CIOs and heads of security at enterprises, we've realized that there pretty much needs to be a new enterprise product of Canva that meets the needs of hugely scaled teams, which has been quite different for us because we have scaled from those individuals just using the product all by themselves and organically growing the teams. And now looking at it from a top-down lens and building that enterprise products is what we've been focused on for the last couple of years. So we'll be pulling the covers off that as well in LA.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:50):
I see another hockey stick approaching. I'm excited of all these things you're launching. What a business you've built. I feel like it's still way too under the radar, even though it's this juggernaut. Nice work, Cameron and team. Two more questions I ask everyone, where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Cameron Adams (01:02:06):
They can find me online at themaninblue.com, which is my blog that's been around for 24 years now. What was the other question? How can you-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:15):
Yeah. How can listeners be useful to you?

Cameron Adams (01:02:18):
I love their design stories, how design has helped unlock something for them, whether it's starting their first business or helping a nonprofit that they volunteer at. I just love bumping into someone in the street and seeing the joy of design right up in their eyes. So please do that whenever you see me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
Beautiful. Cam, you're awesome. Canva is awesome. Go check out canva.com. Easy to find. Thanks for being here.

Cameron Adams (01:02:42):

# How Notion leveraged community to build a $10B business | Camille Ricketts

## Transcript

Camille Ricketts (00:00:00):
The way that you think about product market fit, you have to think about content market fit. So even though content feels like it's running adjacent to the actual product that you're putting out there, you still have to think about who is my audience? Who is the audience that I really want to have? Who is the audience that is going to be drawn to this most? Who are they? What is it that they really need in their lives? Even abstracting content from it at all. What is it that they need to get promoted? What is it that they need to avoid failure? What is it that causes them a great deal of anxiety in the day-to-day of their lives or their work? And can you create some type of content product that is going to address this for them?

Lenny (00:00:38):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Camille Ricketts. Camille was the first marketing hire at Notion and longtime head of marketing at Notion. Prior to that, she was head of content and marketing at First Round Capital, where amongst many other things, she launched the First Round Review, which holds a very special place in my heart because a guest post in the First Round Review essentially helped me launch my now career of newsletter and now podcast. Camille also did content marketing at Kiva and also comms and PR at early Tesla where she sat right next to Elon Musk for about a year and she shares some really fun stories about that.

(00:01:26):
In this episode, we focus on two areas that Camille was very early in and has tremendous insights around. One, community led growth. What it actually is, when it's something you should invest in, how to do it well. All based on her experience building Notion's early community, which was a huge part of Notion's early success. We also talk about content marketing. When it's worth investing in, how to do it well, and all kinds of tips for building a content marketing machine. It was a total blast chatting with Camille and I am really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Camille Rickets right after we hear a word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:02):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by ar Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPO does all that and more. Delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead you to North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPO supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo, geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10X your experiment velocity. Hey, Ashley, head of marketing at Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:03:21):
At least 40%.

Lenny (00:03:23):
And how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:03:26):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (00:03:45):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:04:00):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

(00:04:27):
Camille, welcome to the podcast.

Camille Ricketts (00:04:29):
Hello there. Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny (00:04:32):
Absolutely, my pleasure. You have such a fascinating background working at so many world-class companies with so many fascinating people. Could you just take a minute to talk about some of the wonderful things you've done in your career just to set a little context for folks?

Camille Ricketts (00:04:47):
Yeah. Well thank you for characterizing them as wonderful.

Lenny (00:04:50):
It's true.

Camille Ricketts (00:04:51):
I feel like it's been a quite circuitous path, but definitely has taken me to some interesting places. I started off as a journalist at the Wall Street Journal and then found my way into communications and marketing at Tesla Motors where part of my responsibility there was to sit to Elon's right and make sure he had all the data he needed at his fingertips when talking to the press, which was deep end of the pool on the PR learning. And then after that, found my way to First Round Capital where I was really fortunate to be at the ground floor of First Round Review, if anyone out there watching this is familiar with those pieces. Was there for about five years. Loved that team. Really incredible folks. And then they had invested in Notion really early on, and so I was able to meet Ivan Zhao as a result of that and him and Simon, and they gave me the opportunity to join as the first marketing hire at Notion. And that's what I was doing up until recently.

Lenny (00:05:44):
I love that Elon tidbit. I like that it was on his right. His right hand person. What was that like? And is there something that you learned working alongside Elon, sitting next to Elon, about operating, working that maybe you've taken to other places you worked at?

Camille Ricketts (00:05:59):
I mean, it was a long time ago, so I'll caveat that. This was before Model S came out even. So a lot of my work was, and this was a great opportunity, but driving around in the Roadster and talking to journalists and letting reporters ride in the car, which was very seductive and I think maybe just a little unfair from a PR standpoint. But in terms of what I learned, that was really the first job that I had that was necessitating just being incredibly on point with all the information. So making sure that I knew everything that could possibly come up in a conversation, being incredibly well-versed in just the topics at hand, I think that served me really well. I just have to be really, really, really quick and on it. And then the other thing that Elon I think is very talented at or definitely at the time really made an impression on me was painting an emotional picture of the vision that he was really going after and being able to convey the emotional quality of the mission to the people he talked to. So definitely at the time about the electric vehicle revolution and then space travel, I think he just knew how to make people feel about it that really enlisted a lot of hearts and minds and that is something that I've taken with me for sure.

Lenny (00:07:09):
Would you say that was the most stressful place you've worked or have you found more stress post Elon?

Camille Ricketts (00:07:15):
I think that that was the place where you just needed to be so on your game. Game face every single day. Which is a wonderful skill to learn. And then I think there were other moments in my career where just the stakes might have been a little bit higher. Certainly at Notion every day felt like we're building this thing together and we're in this very special moment. So yeah, I think there was a mix there.

Lenny (00:07:39):
Speaking of Notion, I think you mentioned this and if not, you were the first marketing hire at Notion. Is that right?

Camille Ricketts (00:07:44):
Yes.

Lenny (00:07:45):
What employee number was that?

Camille Ricketts (00:07:47):
I was number 11.

Lenny (00:07:48):
Wow.

Camille Ricketts (00:07:49):
Yeah. So it was really a small squad of folks at the time.

Lenny (00:07:53):
And how big are they now, roughly would you say?

Camille Ricketts (00:07:55):
The last I heard, I think that they were around 400. Maybe a little over 400.

Lenny (00:07:59):
Amazing. And I think they're worth ... I don't know. Last valuation was like $10 billion. So there's been quite the journey. Must have been quite the adventure being at Notion during this time. What's maybe the most tangible memory of working at Notion in the early days? What was it like early day Notion?

Camille Ricketts (00:08:15):
I think a lot about just what the environment felt like. This was the first very small startup that I had worked for. When I left First Round, I really wanted that experience. And the first office that I worked in was really just like a home. It literally had an apartment on top of this loft space and it just felt like we were a group of people who lived there together during the day, but it had that kind of home spun really warm quality. So we all took our shoes off. There was beautiful furnishings and rugs and we would all just sit around and drink tea and work together on these couches. So it really had that feeling to it. And then there were little quirks. I like to reminisce with my colleagues who were there at the time that we didn't have a great HVAC system.

(00:08:58):
So during the summer it was really hot and then in the winter it was really cold and we would have these big industrial fans and at the time we were like, "Oh, this is really bizarre." But now it's one of our favorite memories to talk about. Or for a while we didn't have overhead lighting, so me and my colleagues who were there working really late at night, it would just get darker and darker and darker. And one of my favorite folks there actually had a headlamp that she would switch on at a certain point in the evening. So that's the stuff that really comes up for me. We were all working really hard and in this thing together, but it's that team familial quality that stands out to me.

Lenny (00:09:35):
I love how some of these early moments where it feels like, what the hell are we doing? We have to wear headlamps? It's super hot. When you're in it, you're like, this isn't maybe how our startup should be going. And it feels really painful and hard. But looking back, it's always the best memories, those hardships.

Camille Ricketts (00:09:52):
It truly is. And the moments that we were there late at night really trying to get something done before a big launch the next day, that's where our hearts lie, I think, to a large extent. That crew that was there.

Lenny (00:10:04):
On that note, and when you're talking about stress working with Elon, you talked about Notion had a different kind of stress. What's maybe the most stressful memory you have of working at Notion? Whatever you can share.

Camille Ricketts (00:10:14):
This is something that has long since been rectified, but the first day that we came back from break in 2021 ... We had all been sort of away for the holidays. We reassemble. I think it's January 3rd, 2021 perhaps. Had a massive outage that day that took down, not just us but also a lot of our peer companies. And so it was literally all hands on deck. We're suddenly seeing all of these people on Twitter pop up, on the Reddit pop up being like, "Oh my gosh. What am I going to do?" And it really reinforced for us how central Notion had become to so many people. So on one hand it was kind of this amazing moment of realization of how vital this thing we were building was all the time, which adds to the stress in the moment, but also your motivation overall.

(00:11:01):
And then we also saw on Twitter, and this is part of why community is such a core focus of mine, but people being like, "They're trying really hard to get it back up. Give them a break." Or like, "Sending hugs to the Notion team. We know you've got this." And we really appreciated that and that was just a very heartwarming aspect of it. But that day was definitely a scramble and we wanted to be as communicative as possible. So my team was really central to making sure that everybody knew what was going on, what the efforts were being made to fix it, time horizon, all of that. So they've long since hired the best infrastructure people I think in the industry and refactored the database and everything. So it's not an issue anymore, but certainly that was a moment of stress at the time.

Lenny (00:11:50):
It's interesting looking at those times. When you're in it, you're like, "We are going to die. We're down. People will stop using Notion. We're in big trouble." When really people always come back if it's an awesome product. I think of last things down for a week, JIRA or Confluent, and people come back if it's an awesome product.

Camille Ricketts (00:12:07):
I think that's a good tactical learning and hopefully a takeaway for folks who maybe will experience that moment is that truly there's more resilience built into the system than you might think.

Lenny (00:12:16):
So speaking of community, you talked about just how important that was during this time and then just in general. I was doing research on you and things that you've done over your career to prep for this podcast and I found there's two areas that you've led the charge on and we're ahead of the curve on and in part help innovate. One is community led growth and two is content marketing in a big way. And so I wanted to focus a lot of our chat on these two areas. Community led growth, it feels like a very buzzy topic on Twitter. Everyone's always talking about how the future of growth is community. You've got to build a community. You got to be community led and all these things. And so I want to try to make this concept concrete and help people understand should they invest in community. How can community help you? When does it make sense to you? When does it not make sense to invest? And so maybe just as a first question, just what is community led growth? What does that actually mean as a concept?

Camille Ricketts (00:13:09):
Yeah. I think it has become quite buzzy and it's certainly aspirational for a lot of product led growth companies and even those that are maybe a little bit outside of the product led growth orbit. And we're seeing all of these startups I think also come out that are about community and how to enhance the effects. In terms of how I think about what it actually is, it's when your community helps you achieve such ubiquity and such name recognition that it actually allows you to start moving upmarket into the enterprise. And I know that might be very specific to enterprise oriented companies, but that's how we defined it at Notion was the fact that so many people were talking about this, sharing what they had built about it, honestly starting businesses of their own around it to formalize the relationship with teams that I think it de-risked Notion as a choice for a lot of companies just because they had heard about it through so many channels. They had seen it on social media, they've heard about it on a podcast, their friend told them about it, they saw a billboard. All of that lended itself to larger and larger companies and teams buying more and more seats. So I think that's the power that the community had for us. And I see that also being analogous to what companies like Figma have been able to achieve.

Lenny (00:14:21):
It sounds like a lot of the way you're describing it is basically awareness. Brand awareness is what you found to be maybe the most useful element of this community that you built around Notion.

Camille Ricketts (00:14:31):
I love using the word discovery because I think that that is even a little bit like a step further than awareness where true discovery is when you have intent to find out more. You've heard about it so many times or you've been intrigued by something that someone has told you to the extent that you're actually going to take the step of now learning about it. And that's where we really wanted to play and to emphasize our work.

Lenny (00:14:59):
Got it. So it sounded like the KPI/OKR of your team was get more people aware and excited to explore Notion.

Camille Ricketts (00:15:08):
Yeah. And maybe this is a helpful tactical point. I think when people think about acquisition or discovery or brand awareness or brand in general, they're like what collection of metrics are actually going to give us insight into this? And the one that I found to be the most instructive was net new visitors to the Notion website. So month over month, how many new people who had never been there before were motivated enough to come and actually learn about the product. And that was really the responsibility of the brand team and the folks that worked with me on community and content and all of the awareness campaigns that we were putting out into the field was about getting more new people interested.

Lenny (00:15:49):
So that begs to the question, did you have any clever ways of attributing that new traffic to stuff your team did versus the SEO team or other teams?

Camille Ricketts (00:15:58):
In particular I'll call out the influencer marketing efforts that were really being run by this incredible woman, Lexi Barnhorn, where they were incredibly measurable. Where we were like, okay, well we're sponsoring people for this amount, these creators across these platforms and we know that people came from that content directly to the Notion website. So we were able to draw really tight connections. So I think that some types of content lend themselves to that. And then also with community, there's certain things you can do around helping your community members report on how many people are attending, et cetera, to give you that sense.

Lenny (00:16:36):
So you may be already answering this question, but I'm curious what efforts had the most impact to achieve these goals that you had of creating more awareness and discovery motivation and things like that. What actually worked?

Camille Ricketts (00:16:48):
So I'd say that the community efforts that were very big for us we're the ambassadors. Also making sure that people were hosting in-person events. This really took off in 2019. Obviously we paused for 2020, 2021, but now I just spent time with Notion's head of community, Ben Lang, who truly is the mastermind and genius behind so much of this and he says that they're back up to 30 in-person events a month around the world. So that really helped on the international scale of spreading ubiquity and ended up lending itself to relationships with Station F in France, which is the biggest startup campus in Paris. So really helping us work our way into those types of networks and then supporting those people to also start their own businesses and derive whatever reward they were looking for themselves. So we really wanted to align our goals with theirs.

(00:17:38):
A lot of those folks actually started revenue generating businesses as consultants or course makers or influencers. Some of them just wanted to build their own platforms online. So all of our efforts there are around building guides or counseling people one-on-one or making it easier for them to actually achieve those goals for themselves was also a big part of this growth. And then like I said, influencers. This was something that Ben started exploring in 2019 and we were so pleasantly overwhelmed with the amount of traction and traffic that was driven by working with some of these influencers. And now that program has exploded into a multi-channel effort that's huge for Notion.

Lenny (00:18:24):
Awesome. The influencers makes a lot of sense. I want to learn more about this ambassador program and what that was about with events and maybe just broadly, I imagine a lot of founders might be listening and they're like, "Yeah, this all sounds awesome, but how do you know if it's doing anything?" Events. That would be great, but how much is it worth investing? How much time and attention does it take? How do we know if this is actually ROI positive? Is there anything you learn there about just ... Is it a founder must believe in this as a thing that is probably going to work sort of thing? Or is there something you found to convince people like, yes, this is how you can know it's working?

Camille Ricketts (00:18:58):
That's a great question. I think that we were really fortunate that Ivan saw the inherent value in community from the very beginning and was deeply supportive. And actually one of my number one recommendations for anybody who suspects the community could be a big growth driver is to not make metrics the be all end all at the very beginning. So we didn't necessarily start measuring things very concretely until last year with community. Mostly because we had already seen so much organic scale that we saw being tied to our community efforts in some way in terms of where we were geographically expanding, how people were reporting that they had discovered us whenever we surveyed them. So that type of motion. And I think for any company that is seeing this type of just organic fervor, one of the worst things you can do is say, let's cut this off at the knees if it's not generating ROI.

Lenny (00:19:52):
I imagine internally there's just like obviously this is good. We may not be able to measure it, but it feels like this is very good for Notion. It feels like especially for a prosumer product like Notion, it makes a lot of sense because it's driven by people using it and then they bring it into the company, like you said. Maybe it's less ROI positive or just one enterprise product. Do you have any thoughts there? Is this a great strategy for prosumer enterprise products more so than more enterprise-y?

Camille Ricketts (00:20:19):
Definitely I think if you have a long sales cycle or a high price point where there has to be many, many, many touchpoints in order to get somebody to decide to buy, I'm not sure that community should be the number one thing that you invest in. Certainly for freemium products, I think for a lot of them, especially if they have what I'm going to call the atomic unit of sharing, which I will define out, it becomes a no-brainer. I think that community lends itself particularly well if you have something that your product creates that people want to share because it exhibits something about themselves. So at Notion it was templates or even people just creating their own workspaces and being really excited to show them off. So Notion really benefited from being a creative product, but the same is true of Figma or Canva or any of these where showing people what it is that you've created is an aspirational thing to do. Because you are showing that you are really well versed in how to use the products, extremely organized. You're self expressing in some way. So if your product does have that element to it, I think that community is a great investment.

Lenny (00:21:34):
You touched on this point, and I don't think people realize this, but you can make a lot of money creating templates on Notion, right? That's a whole ecosystem. Can you talk about that? Because I don't think a lot of people know this.

Camille Ricketts (00:21:45):
Yeah. This is one of the reasons that I would advise any of the companies that feel like they fall into this category start early. Because you need to nurture all of these different routes that people in your community can take. Certainly early on I think that the people that we initially recruited in the ambassadors didn't see themselves doing maybe even close to a million dollars in business around helping other teams succeed with the product or selling templates. I remember really early on, probably mid 2021 we heard of one creator who had made $35,000 in four months selling one template and that was a very common story then from that point forward. And helping them do that, actually creating the guide material and the networks and also the connections between the people who are running similar businesses who could help each other, that all became really fundamental. But to your point about, oh is this actually related to the enterprise motion for Notion? So many companies now of many sizes are relying on the consultants that first came up through our community and some of those consultants are now employing dozens of other people.

Lenny (00:22:53):
That's incredible. There's no better way to motivate someone to evangelize Notion than have their income rely on Notion.

Camille Ricketts (00:23:00):
And it's also just inspiring for us, honestly. There's so many people who started off with not very many followers and now they are celebrities within this ecosystem.

Lenny (00:23:12):
So maybe coming back to the ambassador program, that's separate from this selling Notion templates ecosystem. What is the ambassador program?

Camille Ricketts (00:23:19):
They're actually quite blended because the folks who are excited about Notion, it takes a lot of forms. Sometimes they want to host events, sometimes they want to build templates. So we would actually have channels inside of our Slack instance for the ambassadors that had these areas of focus based on what people really were passionate about or wanted to do and they were like a force multiplying flywheel for each other. Because a lot of folks would enter the ambassadors program and then I'm happy to talk about champions as well, which is a little bit different, and then discover what it would mean for them to build templates and it became motivating for that reason. So on the champions side of things, and this is maybe speaking a little bit more to the enterprise as well, we wondered if the same DNA that existed among consumers for the most part in the ambassadors could work for folks who were inside of our customer companies. And so we launched another community, another Slack instance for folks who were the most passionate or the most avid users of Notion inside of our customer companies, which has become just a wonderful channel for customer success to be more communicative with those companies, make sure that things are sticking or obstacles are being overcome. And that's been designed very specifically that way and it has been really, really valuable over time.

Lenny (00:24:35):
Okay. So let me try to understand this. Champions are basically the most active users of Notion. You put them in a Slack and help them become even more excited and make sure they're happy. Ambassador. I still don't totally understand what is an ambassador? Is that someone you're paying to help promote Notion? What does that actually mean when you're an ambassador?

Camille Ricketts (00:24:52):
They're people who are really just passionate about the product. So it's not transactional. They're people who love building with Notion. They love sharing what they've built in order to help others. And they really just want it to be a bigger part of their lives. And I think that one of the points about community is that it's not just a one-to-one conversation with us. The big draw over time, maybe people joined because they would get early access to features. We would get their feedback. That became really important for our product team or because we would offer AMAs with some of our folks internally. But over time it was really because they were forming these bonds with each other and learning so much from each other that most of the time someone would come in and say, I'm struggling with this or I don't quite know how to use this and it would be another member of the community that would help them more immediately. So it really allowed them to form these dense networks of friendships that I think became just a positive part of people's lives.

Lenny (00:25:51):
What I'm taking away from this partly is you identify a group of people that are interested in Notion, excited about Notion and then just lean in to support them. There's people that are buying Notion and that are power users, help them be better power users. Influencers that are kind of excited about Notion, pay them to promote Notion. Then the ambassadors that are people just passionate about Notion, help them be more passionate. And then the people making templates, help them be successful. Is that roughly how you think about it? Just identify something that's working and make it more effective?

Camille Ricketts (00:26:21):
I think if it doesn't sound too reductive, yes. I would also say that one of the things that I think Ben was best at is not putting a one size fits all experience on any of this. I think that some communities get built where people are like, okay, well we have this community and it's going to be this and this and this, or these are the types of programs we're going to offer or these are the types of interactions we're going to have. As opposed to I think a lot of listening of the people who are actually participating. Really early on one of the things that Ben did that I thought was really amazing was he'd spend a ton of time just on Zoom having conversations, one-on-one conversations, semi small group conversations just saying, "Why are you here? Why do you like participating in this? What is it that would make it better?" And really helping our entire team follow their lead. I would recommend highly not necessarily coming in with preconceived notions about what a community needs to look like.

Lenny (00:27:21):
You touched on this, that if the founder believes in the power of community, this becomes so much easier. A lot of founders are like, "Nah. That's a waste of time." Do you think founders are convincible that building community and investing in community is worth it? Have you seen that effective where a founder just comes into it being like, "Nah, I don't think this is worth our time," and then they get convinced later? Or is it just like, "Nah, forget it. Don't even try."?

Camille Ricketts (00:27:45):
I mean I've talked to a lot of different people who come at this with different impressions and everybody knows more about their company than I do, but I do think that if ubiquity or just the sheer word of mouth engine is something that is going to be valuable for your company over time, I would really urge people to sit down and really think carefully what is going to be more conducive to our long-term success? Is it going to be that ubiquity or is it going to be revenue now? And I think if we look at a lot of the companies that have been just wildly successful from the start, they're people who have pushed off maybe monetizing every little thing if it's going to really put a damper on that type of enthusiasm and momentum that people have to share it at what it is they're doing. Because there's always opportunity I think later once you have that big tide of people who are not just excited but also legitimizing what it is that you do every single day, that gets mobilized in a lot of different directions and you have a lot more options then.

Lenny (00:28:47):
What's interesting about Notion is you have high LTVs when you sell to larger companies, but the initial users are often just regular folks. And so I think it's a unique place where you have cash to spend on making it ubiquitous and getting the word out through all these community efforts because it'll pay off. And a lot of companies probably don't have that advantage. So would it feel right to say that this is really effective for product led, growthy, freemium products most? Is that a good way to think about it?

Camille Ricketts (00:29:20):
Yeah. Or I think if organic growth is something that you see being really beneficial or if organic growth happens to be something you really have to crack because you don't always have everything you need for paid growth from either a resourcing standpoint, team standpoint, really figuring out how to get that organic flywheel going can serve you well. It becomes this buttress for any paid growth you explore in the future.

Lenny (00:29:47):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta. Helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential, SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months. Less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:31:04):
What other companies come to mind when you think about companies that effectively did community led growth, did community well and grew in large part because of community?

Camille Ricketts (00:31:14):
I've mentioned Figma a couple times here so I don't want to beleaguer the point, but they're certainly a team that I've looked up to through my entire experience at Notion. We were kind of sibling companies in a way. Huge kudos to Claire Butler over there who I knew led all of those efforts and we would trade a lot of knowledge back and forth, which was so lovely to have that relationship. But they did an amazing job I think in a similar vein to Notion of saying, okay, people are really excited to create these things and then put them out there on the internet. So how can we just fuel that particular motion out there? The other example I'll give, which is a little bit of a different tack is Stripe. And when Stripe launched Stripe Atlas, not necessarily core to the initial product line that Stripe was known for and what had been foundational for them, but allowed them to build this community among probably their core demographic at the time, which was founders and startups that were growing through the stages to mid-market, they were able to cultivate this huge audience of founders around giving advice and providing them with resources to actually get started and do that zero to one journey.

(00:32:22):
So while it was adjacent to maybe what the company's core mission was, it allowed them to actually create community among their customer base because they were like, "We're knowledgeable. We can share these things with you that we know are core to your journey." So I would encourage anyone who's thinking about community that way to be like, "Oh, maybe it doesn't have to be around our product. So specifically. What other knowledge or resourcing can we offer to the people who we do want using our product that's going to be really instrumental for them and can we convene them around that idea?"

Lenny (00:32:54):
I'm noticing a strong correlation between legendary generational companies, Figma, Stripe, Notion and community efforts and building community. That's interesting.

Camille Ricketts (00:33:05):
Yes. I'm a big proponent. At the same time I don't think that community is right for every company. I think that there is definitely an analysis to run on that. But hopefully this is helpful for those who can identify that those are attributes they have.

Lenny (00:33:19):
To pull on a thread there, what are maybe thoughts for when it probably doesn't make sense to invest a lot of efforts into building a community around your product? We talked a little bit about high-end enterprise products. Is there anything else that just like, man, it's probably not worth your time?

Camille Ricketts (00:33:34):
Like I said, if it's more of a sales led culture that you have, which is definitely true of products that are a little bit pricier or that require longer contracts, so understanding that. But I do think the community takes on different forms and I think when you hear the word community, you think of a big forum of some type, whether it's a Slack instance or something else where people are chatting away all day long. And I don't think it has to be that. That's not the only representation of it. So if you think about what is going to be right for you at any given time, I actually created this two by two matrix, which maybe I'll share with you after this. And on the axis you have, whether you have hit product market fit or if you're still exploring product market set and then whether you're strongly enterprise or strongly consumer. And based on where you land in that two by two matrix, there's a form of community or a community related initiative that could be right for you.

(00:34:31):
So just to give you an example of maybe an extremely different form factor from Notion, let's say that you're still on your way to product market fit and you're a strongly enterprise oriented product. I think that you have the opportunity to do customer advisory boards, which is really convening even smaller circles of ideal fit users and making sure that they are connected to each other as well as you, and then incentivize to provide you with feedback. Understanding that they're really on the ground floor of this journey with you and that they're going to be able to have influence over whatever you do in the future. Those folks can end up growing into your biggest evangelists and I've seen that happen a number of times and I would still consider that community even though maybe that is not what comes to mind for folks.

Lenny (00:35:20):
Well I imagine that becomes the seed of a community that you eventually build. Let's definitely link to this in the show notes. Can you give maybe a couple more examples of this grid? So that was pre-product market fit and then what was the other?

Camille Ricketts (00:35:32):
Strongly enterprise.

Lenny (00:35:33):
Enterprise. Okay, cool. Yeah, what are a couple other of the elements of this grid?

Camille Ricketts (00:35:37):
So if you're strongly enterprise and you have product market fit, let's say, this is something that Notion has really benefited from, but really emphasizing the champions in the consultants communities. So the folks who, like I said, may be inside of your customers who really get it, really get your value, really are excited to help you land and expand perhaps inside of their companies, making sure that they have a place to gather and a place to feel like they are more connected with your team than the average person gets to be. That they are special and that they have access. And then on the consultant side, like I said, just making it really easy, removing friction, helping promote the folks who want to be out there, helping you succeed with more customers. Like Salesforce. I know that this is a golden oldie of an example, but if you talk to anybody who was really early at Salesforce, they really went into this where they saw people emerging who wanted to help other companies. This layer of people who didn't work at Salesforce but saw the opportunity to help other companies actually succeed with it, implement it, grow with it, and that's become a massive part of Salesforce's model. And so if you're in that quadrant, figuring out how to start moving people in your customer base into those categories.

Lenny (00:37:00):
This is awesome. Maybe let's do one more of this grid and then we'll leave one for people to click into and check it out.

Camille Ricketts (00:37:04):
I'll talk about Notion's quadrant, which is the one that I would put up and to the right, which is you have product market fit and you're maybe a little bit closer to the consumer side of the spectrum. Obviously Notion runs the full gamut, but I would say especially early on I think that that's where we saw things take root and that's where I think ambassadors and influencers really take off. Individuals who are going to be extremely vocal, extremely excited, and where you're going to see more of this wildfire spread, at least trying the product, using the product, understanding what the product is. So if you can try to fuel that type of motion if you're in that quadrant, that's helpful.

Lenny (00:37:43):
I want to come back to this ambassador program real quick because it feels like something that a lot of people talk about and can do and especially in this quadrant of product market fit and consumer. How does this work? Is it you select, here's 100 ambassadors we're going to pick because we think they're awesome and they're great examples of people using, say, Notion and then we're just going to provide them with all the help they need to be successful with Notion. How do you think about creating an ambassador program?

Camille Ricketts (00:38:10):
I actually think it's pretty analogous to when you're thinking about positioning your company because I think the best first step for any positioning exercise is to think who are our best fit customers? And it's not necessarily who we wish they would be, but it's actually the hard cold reality of who they actually are. Where it's like these are the people that seem to be really getting it. They're paying us more, they're talking about it just organically. So really figuring out everything about who they are and making sure that those are the people that you're actually inviting in early. So the initial base of the ambassadors program which started back in 2019 was just 20 people and they were the 20 people who we happened to see be the most vocal already across Twitter and a couple of other social media platforms because they had that shared quality of wanting to be really vocal and expressive about their experience with the product. So that would be my advice for how to get one of these rolling.

Lenny (00:39:13):
And then what do you do for them?

Camille Ricketts (00:39:13):
Definitely making sure that there's enough incentive built in, right? Because like we said, it's not meant to be a transactional relationship, but we want them to feel like they are having a special experience, that they are connected with the company in a unique way. And it was so interesting to us how giving them the preview of features was so motivating to them and being able to use them and then give us feedback and feel really heard by the product team. So that was a big area of focus and I know that that still is and it's become even more of a robust conversation between the community and the team at Notion itself.

(00:39:52):
And then also we would do these very special experiences where Ivan or Akshay or Simon or MLM who's the head of engineering there would be available for these conversations where they would answer questions and it would feel like a very proprietary space. I think that that was really interesting to people. And then of course the things that you would suspect around subsidizing events. Making sure that people felt that they were actually supported by us to throw these events. And then also promoting their work. So if you look back at the social media channels, so much of the focus is on putting the creations of the people we were working with front and center as opposed to talking about just what the company was up to.

Lenny (00:40:36):
Have you ever written about just how to design an ambassador program or has anyone written about how Notion did this? Because this is really interesting.

Camille Ricketts (00:40:42):
I don't know if anything has been written or went into all of this detail, but it was truly one of the more magical and I think still is one of the more magical parts of this entire endeavor. And now that team is three people. So Ben who's still there doing amazing things, Francisco who joined us in 2021. Or sorry at the end of 2020. And then Emma. And they are just all day every day talking to people around the whole world. The international component of this is also just completely wild to see.

Lenny (00:41:18):
This could be a future First Round Review post, which we'll talk a bit about.

Camille Ricketts (00:41:21):
Yes. Perhaps.

Lenny (00:41:24):
Last question about this segment. Say someone is convinced they want to start investing in community and we talked about this two by two, but maybe just broadly if you had to boil it down to two or three pieces of advice for founders, for teams thinking about investing in community led growth and community in general, what would be some of those pieces of advice?

Camille Ricketts (00:41:44):
I don't know if you want to link to this in the show notes as well, but I actually put together some commandments for community builders.

Lenny (00:41:50):
Ooh. Absolutely.

Camille Ricketts (00:41:51):
Some alliteration. So the thing that I think were very defining for us early on, I already mentioned something about this, but not trying to hit a number early on. So don't dilute the impact of what it is that you're trying to do in order to show growth. I think that that's very important to protect yourself early on. So making sure that you are learning what individuals really want out of this and making them feel like they're very seen and very heard. That was a big area of focus and I think it's what kept people really engaged and coming back and feeling like this was a secondary family for them. And then one of the things that was most interesting to us that once we started sharing what was going on in the community with folks at Notion. So we would do this during all Hands meetings or on Slack, Ben would post these really incredible updates of just all of the activities of people in the community and what they were up to every month.

(00:42:46):
And it was just so inspiring for everybody inside the company that I think it all rallied us to do even more, I guess, day to day and really understand who it was we were building for.

Lenny (00:43:00):
Is there any other commandments you would add for if you already have a community going? If you have something bubbling for things you should do to keep it healthy and consistently good and growing?

Camille Ricketts (00:43:12):
Yeah. I mean this is going to be a little contrarian perhaps, and I mean this is just one data point for me, but not growing it so big so fast. One thing that we actually thought about pretty carefully was what a rate of healthy growth would be. So there actually is an application process for joining the ambassadors. It's a very light application process and it really is just so that we know how many people are interested in this. And then they're inducted around ... I think at the time it was 20 people at a time every month. So that it wouldn't feel like all of a sudden this had changed in terms of how the interactions were feeling, but rather gave everybody time to welcome the new people in and get to know them. And one of Ben and I's favorite things ever about working at Notion I think was when we would induct new people into the ambassadors and they would introduce themselves and say, "Hey, I am from Venezuela and here's the ways in which notion has changed my life."

Lenny (00:43:12):
That's awesome.

Camille Ricketts (00:44:11):
"I'm from Hong Kong and here's how it's changed my life." And all of that was just so fulfilling. That would be the number one thing I would say is give your community time to actually grow in what feels like an organic fashion as well. Because I think ironically, and then I'll stop rambling about this, but if you grow to something like, oh we have 5,000 ambassadors, which feels really good to say on a website, the conversation is actually very muted. I think because people feel like they're speaking to an auditorium whenever they say anything. I think it's because you don't really have a sense of who else is there with you. So helping to defray those concerns I think is a good course of action.

Lenny (00:44:57):
I've seen the same thing with the growth rate being really important with my newsletter Slack community. I think most listeners probably know this, but if you're a paid newsletter subscriber, you get access to the Slack community. There's about 10,000 people in there. And I find the filter of people that are willing to pay for content like a newsletter is a really good filter for awesome people. And so it ends up slowing growth in a really healthy way and then just creating this filter of the people that really want to self-improve and value the sort of thing join, and it becomes a really amazing group of people.

Camille Ricketts (00:45:31):
Yeah. It feels like such a ... I don't know. There's an emotional quality to it I think when that's the case. And all of those people end up being so incredibly impactful. The last point I'll make about community at Notion is that a lot of those people, and we actually ended up launching I think a channel for folks who wanted to do this in particular, but run communities external to Notion's actual owned communities. So you end up with Facebook groups that have ... I think Notion in Vietnam has like 250,000 members. Or the subreddit, which I now know has 210,000 people in the Notion subreddit. And those are all run and moderated by community members who just love running their own communities.

Lenny (00:46:14):
I feel like you've achieved your OKRs of ubiquity of Notion.

Camille Ricketts (00:46:19):
Yes. It was always a value at Notion to make sure that we were reaching as many people as possible.

Lenny (00:46:26):
It's working. One tactical question. Where does the own community of Notion live? Is it a Slack? Is it an online thing you've built yourself?

Camille Ricketts (00:46:34):
It is in Slack. And the thinking there, and it still is, was that we really just wanted to be in the course of people's everyday lives. We didn't want to be this other destination that you would have to make a point to going to every day.

Lenny (00:46:45):
That's exactly how I thought about it with my newsletter Slack community. PMs and founders, they're already in Slack all day. And just that badge, being on the app telling them there's something to check is such a powerful feature versus download a whole new app or go to a whole new website, you're never going to go there. It has to be 10 times better to pull you to a whole new site and change your habits.

Camille Ricketts (00:47:05):
I absolutely agree.

Lenny (00:47:07):
I'm glad we're all on Slack. Slack's so underrated. I feel like people hate on Slack all the time, but it's such a good product.

Camille Ricketts (00:47:14):
We all love it. It's just becomes something we take for granted in the background there.

Lenny (00:47:17):
Yeah, exactly. Okay. This is a good time to shift to our second topic, which is around content and content marketing. So you started the First Round Review at First Round?

Camille Ricketts (00:47:26):
Yes.

Lenny (00:47:27):
I don't know if you know this, but First Round Review was a big part of my early trajectory with this newsletter life. I did a guest post in the First Round Review and that was-

Camille Ricketts (00:47:37):
I remember this.

Lenny (00:47:38):
That was a huge deal for me. That was my first 500 subscribers to my newsletter.

Camille Ricketts (00:47:42):
Wow.

Lenny (00:47:44):
Then I did another guest post down the road, but that was not as important. It was a big part of my early path down this life. And so thank you for creating that platform. I was very honored to be involved.

Camille Ricketts (00:47:57):
That's fantastic to hear and exactly what we wanted to have happen. Just extraordinary operators being given a platform and then using it to do whatever it is that they wanted to do. That was part of the dream always.

Lenny (00:48:10):
It's working.

Camille Ricketts (00:48:11):
Yeah. I'm thrilled because now people are learning so much from you.

Lenny (00:48:14):
Yeah. It's an inspiration for where when I started too, just I wish I could be as good as the First Round Review and the stuff just keeps coming and coming. It's amazing. And I know other folks run it now. I don't know if they want to be named. They like to be behind the scenes.

Camille Ricketts (00:48:27):
They do, but I'm going to shout them out anyway because they do such an extraordinary job. I mean, Jessi Craige Shikman over there has been doing this now for longer than I did and she is absolutely incredible and her team is extraordinary and I don't miss it every single time it comes out.

Lenny (00:48:44):
Yeah. I tried to thank her my post. She's like, "Don't mention that. I'm behind the scenes."

Camille Ricketts (00:48:44):
Maybe I'll ask her.

Lenny (00:48:53):
We have to give her some cred somehow.

Camille Ricketts (00:48:56):
Yeah, absolutely. She deserves it.

Lenny (00:48:58):
So kind of zooming out, content marketing, maybe just to give some examples of just what are some of the most impactful things you've been a part of that come from creating content? Whether it's Notion, First Round, anywhere else, what are some examples?

Camille Ricketts (00:49:11):
Yeah, I'll give a few examples. Obviously First Round is a huge example and so I'd be remiss in not going into some detail there. And truly that was a team effort from the very beginning. I joined in 2013 and again, I was just so fortunate to work with a leader who believed in it from the very beginning. Josh Kopelman, who's the partner there who was just a massive supporter of mine. Phin Barnes on the partnership team. But then particularly Brett Burson who was running the platform team, which is where all of these value added services lived.

(00:49:40):
So it was me and an events person and the talent person and Brett just gave us all of the runway and all of the belief and support that we needed. And he was really bullish on content and really helped from the beginning, connecting me with incredible interview subjects. Because this whole thing, the only reason I think it survived and did as well as it did is that we were able to land a few really big names at the very beginning. And then of course that helps you down the road whenever you're trying to convince anyone else to do it because you say so and so and so and so have already been featured. So that was I think just a big point of confidence and also tactically, for anyone out there thinking about it, if they can leverage whatever connections they have in that vein.

Lenny (00:50:27):
I was at dinner with Brett yesterday.

Camille Ricketts (00:50:29):
Oh my god. What a guy, right?

Lenny (00:50:31):
First Round event. What a guy. That guy's amazing. I'm a huge fan. He's built an incredible platform and program at First Round.

Camille Ricketts (00:50:39):
And he's one of the people that I've learned the most from, certainly. But more specific to your question around what the content program was able to do there, certainly discovery of First Round. I think prior to that it was a very successful VC fund, but I think we got in front of all kinds of people, particularly in non-traditional geographies or non-traditional founder types or all of that. People who are inside large companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, whenever we would look at our list of subscribers, we had an disproportionate number of email addresses within those companies that were clearly curious about the startup experience. And I think First Round Review was helpful in moving them more toward that mindset and then them obviously understanding that First Round would be a great first stop for them.

Lenny (00:51:23):
What would you say is key to content being valuable? So you're talking about the First Round Review became really effective for people learning about First Round, working with First Round, discovery of First Round, but it's not just with content you just write some stuff and it works. It doesn't work that way. What have you learned about just what do you have to get right? You mentioned have names people recognize. Is there anything else you've learned over the years of just like, here's what we need to get right if you're trying to use content as a way to create discovery and awareness of your stuff?

Camille Ricketts (00:51:54):
This is something that I think we chatted about briefly, but the way that you think about product market fit, you have to think about content market fit. So even though content feels like it's running adjacent to the actual product that you're putting out there, you still have to think about who is my audience? Who is the audience that I really want to have? Who is the audience that is going to be drawn to this most? Who are they? What is it that they really need in their lives? Even abstracting content from it at all. What is it that they need to get promoted? What is it that they need to avoid failure? What is it that causes them a great deal of anxiety in the day-to-day of their lives or their work? And can you create some type of content product that is going to address this for them and is actually going to have that value?

(00:52:36):
So I think approaching content the way that you would a product in a lot of ways is very instructive way to sort of start hashing out your strategy. Starting with your audience, understanding their big needs. You've heard this, I'm sure, and most of your audience has, but there's the vitamin versus painkiller dichotomy. And painkillers always win. So can your content be a painkiller? Can it help people out of situations that are causing them a lot of pain? Can it help people stop being so confused or can it make them even feel less alone in their experience? That was a big one for First Round Review is helping operators share failures or suboptimal situations in the spirit of helping many other people feel like that was normalized and that the experiences they were having weren't as dire as maybe they had thought.

Lenny (00:53:27):
I love that. It connects so much with the way I think about writing. I use the jobs to be done framework a little bit here where I'm just like, what job am I doing when I'm writing a post? And you tell me if this makes sense to you, but I feel like there's four jobs to be done of a newsletter. Either how people make money. There's newsletters, here's how to invest, here's how to buy Bitcoin and win. How people make money. Entertain people. There's a lot of funny things, memes and cartoons and things like that. How people get better at their work or life, which is the category we're in. And then inform people. Like news.

Camille Ricketts (00:54:02):
Yes. What they didn't know before. Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:05):
And it feels like you got to do really well. You got to pick which bucket you're in. And let me know if you can think of any others because these are the four that I always come back to. And then pick your bucket and then it's be the best at that thing in your category. The way I think about it.

Camille Ricketts (00:54:18):
I love that listing out of those and also the acknowledgement that there are emotional jobs to be done. That there are not just utilitarian jobs to be done. It's not just, you didn't know this before and now you do, but it's like you felt this way before and now you don't or you do. And I think that that's underestimated. So I love that you called out entertaining people because we're all working in an industry where it's wonderful to interact with some of that sparkle and levity. So I love that approach.

Lenny (00:54:45):
And something else that goes unsaid I think in the way you talked about this is just putting in the time to make it really high quality. If you look at a First Round post, how much time would you say goes into in the typical First Round Review post?

Camille Ricketts (00:54:58):
Oh gosh. Here's where I'm going to shout out my writing partner at First Round, Sean Young, who was there with me for most of my time there and he and I would always, always talk about this. But it would take eight hours to just write the thing. And that's after you had done all of the prep work of making sure that your interviewee was feeling really anchored and understanding a topic that you were both really excited about and making sure you were mining all of the tactical gems from that conversation. And then you would start writing and that would be another eight hours. I don't know if that's your experience, but certainly was ours.

Lenny (00:55:31):
Yeah, very similar. I don't tie myself, but I feel like the median time to write a post for me is about 10 hours.

Camille Ricketts (00:55:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:55:37):
And that's I think the key that a lot of people don't think about. One is they don't have the time, and two, they don't realize they should spend this much time because the bar's so high for content on the internet as we all know. There's so much stuff out there. And so to get above that noise you have to really make it really good and that just takes time. And I find this really strong correlation between the time it takes me to write a post and how well it does. It's very highly correlated. And the advantage folks like say the First Round Review have and I have is I do this and there's a team doing this. And so people that are doing this on the side, it's much harder because they don't have that time.

Camille Ricketts (00:56:14):
It is. I end up admiring those people a lot where I'm like, how are you doing this?

Lenny (00:56:18):
Yeah. They're sacrificing something.

Camille Ricketts (00:56:19):
Yeah. But truly, it's a very shared experience with you. And I think that a lot of that was making connections between the information that you had available from these interviews. So not just straight here's what this person said, but how can you draw connections between those things, connect the dots, pull out bigger themes. All of that is really where I think a lot of the time went.

Lenny (00:56:43):
So you said you had this content market fit questionnaire that you talked through. You're going to send me a link that we can point people to check it out, right?

Camille Ricketts (00:56:51):
Yes.

Lenny (00:56:51):
Okay, awesome.

Camille Ricketts (00:56:52):
Absolutely. A lot of it is about getting to know your audience to an almost beleaguered degree.

Lenny (00:56:57):
Which is basically what job will you do for them, like you said. And so that makes sense. Maybe a couple more questions. Something that I've noticed a lot, and this is related to content and just PR and stuff like that. I've noticed a lot of people on Twitter and founders are trying to pitch this idea that you don't need to think about comms and press and PR as much because now you can go direct. You can have a newsletter, you can write, you can tweet, you can LinkedIn. Do you feel like that is where the future is going for founder press and comms and things like that or do you think you still need to have a really strong comms, press, PR org within your company?

Camille Ricketts (00:57:36):
That's a great question because I think that there's been just a lot of change in this space over the last five years and certainly very strong opinions from all over the ecosystem. I'm a big believer in comms. And I don't just say that because I used to be a journalist or I used to work in comms. But I think that there are very few and far between incredible megaphones for what it is that you or your company is doing where you get to reach such a breadth of people with that stamp of credibility and notice. How do you get somebody to say, "Hey, this is really something you should pay attention to."? Obviously I support all of the owned media efforts that are really working and bubbling up. And like I said, influencer I think is going to be a massive shift in how we discover things, but maintaining a wonderful relationship with the press, being straightforward, being that brand that is going to be accessible, I really think that that pays off.

(00:58:37):
And just to give you one example, David Pierce, who I think is one of the best working journalists in tech today, he's at The Verge now. He was covering personal tech for the Wall Street Journal early on at Notion and published a story that said this is the one work-life productivity app that you'll ever need. And that was Notion's big break. Truly, if you look back at the graphs, that made a demonstrable difference. And I've seen that happen time and time again. And one of my other efforts at First Round was helping companies in the portfolio figure out how to DIY comm strategies. And I saw this again and again that the companies that did get stories that really told their mission, it made a big difference for just discovery awareness. The number of people who wanted to be involved with them as candidates, as investors, as customers.

Lenny (00:59:29):
This gives me a new post idea of just what are the big breaks of companies? What was the moment where they started taking off? Note to self?

Camille Ricketts (00:59:36):
Yes. The other big thing for the Notion was product hunts. I want to give them-

Lenny (00:59:40):
Oh, okay. So posting on Product Hunt, that was a big deal for Notion.

Camille Ricketts (00:59:44):
It was. And it remains a big deal. If you go on Product Hunt and you type in Notion, you'll see just how many templates have been able to get noted because of Product Hunt.

Lenny (00:59:54):
So it's the templates being posted, but then also the launch of Notion on Product Hunt?

Camille Ricketts (00:59:58):
Yes. And Notion 2.0. And then whenever we would have a major productized launch.

Lenny (01:00:05):
Wow, that's awesome. Man, Product Hunt just keeps kicking.

Camille Ricketts (01:00:07):
Notion AI very recently for them, which couldn't be more exciting.

Lenny (01:00:11):
I have access to that. I've been playing around. It's awesome. Maybe a last question along these lines is thinking about the founders that you've worked with. So on the one hand you have Elon who is very direct on Twitter to his audience, and then Ivan feels much less so and more under the radar and doesn't love tweeting a lot. And then First Round Review somewhere in the middle. Do you have any thoughts on how much a founder should invest in, say, tweeting and going and communicating direct to folk? Or is it more just whatever the founder is, their personality, just go with that?

Camille Ricketts (01:00:41):
I really do think it's about personality and what feels authentic. I think that so much of a founder's strength comes from leaning into where they know that they love to work, what they know about themselves. And I think that one of the biggest mistakes you can make on social media is giving yourself a quota that you have to hit and say, I have to say X number of scintillating things every week on these platforms. We've just seen so much more traction, even from the main Notion accounts when we're a little bit more reserved and we wait until we have something to say that has value.

Lenny (01:01:12):
Awesome. Any last closing thoughts before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Camille Ricketts (01:01:19):
Closing thoughts. No, this was a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much for letting me share. Truly, I also want to make sure I'm giving a lot of credit away from all the people that I mentioned throughout. It was all just a major team effort and I've gotten very, very lucky to work with the best people.

Lenny (01:01:32):
Awesome. We'll try to link to all of the people you mentioned in our show notes. We try to do that every time. So it'll be a long show notes. And we're not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I am going to ask you six questions real quick. Whatever comes to mind, we'll go through it pretty fast. That sound good?

Camille Ricketts (01:01:48):
Yeah. We'll see how it goes.

Lenny (01:01:50):
Let's go. No pressure. What are two to three books that you recommend most, that you've recommended most to other people?

Camille Ricketts (01:01:57):
Obviously Awesome by April Dunford. If you're looking to position your company, I don't know if you've read it, but it is a step-by-step guide. It's like 100 pages long.

Lenny (01:02:05):
I've read it. She's done a guest post on my newsletter. She's been on the podcast. So all over it.

Camille Ricketts (01:02:11):
Oh, fantastic. She's incredible. Yes. Oh gosh. I'm going to have a hard time coming up with two other books that have had that sizable of an impact.

Lenny (01:02:19):
We can keep it to one too. It's all good.

Camille Ricketts (01:02:21):
Can we keep it to one?

Lenny (01:02:22):
Yes. Just the one. All you need. What's a favorite other podcast that you listen to other than the one you're on currently?

Camille Ricketts (01:02:30):
I mean, I love your podcast.

Lenny (01:02:31):
Thank you.

Camille Ricketts (01:02:32):
Harry Stubbings never ceases to amaze me. We've gone on at Notion a couple times and I just really appreciate his approach to mining a lot of incredible information and unexpected stuff.

Lenny (01:02:46):
Harry Stubbings is the godfather of this podcast because I did his podcast and at the end of it privately he's like, "Lenny, you need to do a podcast, you idiot. Why are you not doing a podcast?" And that got me over the hump and look at us now. So yeah, huge shout out to Harry.

Camille Ricketts (01:03:00):
I love all of these connections that exists. That's wonderful.

Lenny (01:03:02):
Yeah. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've loved?

Camille Ricketts (01:03:08):
Oh gosh. Recent. I went to go see Tar, which I know is going to be not everybody's cup of tea, but it was just incredible to watch this performance from Kate Blanchett. She learned German. She learned how to be a credible conductor of a major symphony orchestra. If you want to see a bravura performance, that's the one to see. And then recent television show I'm watching Fleischman is in Trouble. I love the book and I just think that the detail and texture of that show is super well done.

Lenny (01:03:37):
Awesome. My wife and I have been watching that and it's awesome. Last episode was less exciting, so I'm curious where it all goes, but I'm watching.

Camille Ricketts (01:03:44):
Agreeing. But every time Claire Danes is on screen, I'm riveted. Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:50):
Favorite interview question that you like to ask folks, either when you're interviewing at a place, hiring, anything that comes to mind.

Camille Ricketts (01:03:56):
Yeah. The one thing that was really helpful, because we used to do this thing at First Round Review where we would explore topics and be like, how do we get to a topics that's going to be unique or new knowledge or whatever it was. And it was, what is one thing that you think that led to your success that nobody else in your peer set has done? What was something that you did on a lark or that you were like, this is a big bet, or this isn't probably going to work, or it's a mistake that it even turned out this way, but it ended up being great. What is that one thing that was unusually conceived that you want to share with people?

Lenny (01:04:24):
I love that question. I almost want to answer it, but let's move on. What are five SaaS products that you use or have used other than notion that you found to be really good other than maybe Slack, which everyone always mentions.

Camille Ricketts (01:04:39):
I mean, I'm in love with Notion. The other thing, the other great love of my life right now is Arc, The Browser Company.

Lenny (01:04:44):
Oh my God, I love Arc. I just switched to it. I love it.

Camille Ricketts (01:04:47):
Yeah. It was something that I tried and within an hour I've made it my default browser and I just think it's beautiful and delightful in one of those intangible ways that a lot of these products are

Lenny (01:04:58):
Same. Yes. Cool. Oh, there's more. Yeah.

Camille Ricketts (01:05:00):
I already talked about Figma. I love Figma. I actually use it in my day to day life, which is one of the best parts of it is that folks who are not necessarily designers or highly technical can also get a lot out of it. Superhuman. Couldn't live my life without Superhuman. Whenever I have to go back into Gmail to set an autoresponder or whatever, I'm like, ugh, my eyes. So couldn't live without that. Gosh, I'm on sabbatical, so I don't know how many other SaaS products I'm actually using day to day so I'm going to keep it at three.

Lenny (01:05:29):
All right. Yeah. Use less SaaS products during your sabbatical. It's a good philosophy.

Camille Ricketts (01:05:33):
Yeah. I don't know if that was your experience, but just is. Oh, the other one I'll shout out, even though this is like a sneaky Notion plug is Kron. So if anybody isn't using the Kron calendar, which is now part of Notion as some folks might know, it is in fact the best calendar product on the market.

Lenny (01:05:47):
Sneaky, sneaky. Last question. What's a favorite read or course or just anything you'd recommend for people to level up their community building skills to build a community, run a community? What would you point people to?

Camille Ricketts (01:06:01):
I'm not aware of any courses that are necessarily offered. Ben Lang has done a number of AMAs or interviews, so if you want to just Google Ben Lang and the word community or Notion, you're going to find just a lot of incredible insight. And his experience has been, I think ... In terms of community people operating in tech, Ben is top level, so find whatever he's said.

Lenny (01:06:27):
Awesome. We will find it. We will link to it. Camille, I just met you an hour ago, but I feel like I've known you forever. This was amazing.

Camille Ricketts (01:06:34):
Likewise. Thank you.

Lenny (01:06:35):
Thank you so much for making time for this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more? You're on sabbatical now, and so maybe share what you're thinking about next and what you could be ... I don't know. And I guess this is the second question. How can listeners be useful to you?

Camille Ricketts (01:06:49):
Thank you for that. You can find me on Twitter. I'm just @CamilleRicketts. Super straightforward. Still sticking with it. And in terms of where I'm at in my life, I'm just interested in meeting as many fascinating new people and learning about things as possible. I've started going to these Founders You Should Know events for anybody who's interested about FYSK, and just meeting as many cool people who are building just incredible concepts. It's inspiring every time, and I just want my whole life to look like that. So get in touch if you're building something and think I could be helpful.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Amazing. Camille, thank you so much for being here.

# How to achieve hypergrowth in your business and career | Carilu Dietrich (Atlassian)

## Transcript

Carilu Dietrich (00:00:00):
In order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company. The biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use, right? I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. 

(00:00:22):
And then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. Hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years, right? They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200. They're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth, because it's going to be here before you know it.

Lenny (00:00:55):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard work, experiences building and growing today's most successful products. 

(00:01:04):
Today my guest is Carilu Dietrich. Carilu is a former CMO and has advised the CEOs and CMOs of hypergrowth B2B companies like Segment, Miro, 1Password, Bill.com, Productboard, Sprout Social, Weights & Biases, and most notably was head of marketing at Atlassian through their IPO. 

(00:01:22):
In today's episode, we cover what hypergrowth companies have in common, how to make big changes to your growth strategy to unlock new channels of growth, why COs don't trust CMOs, and why most CMOs get fired. Also, why most CPOs get fired. Plus, the benefits of waiting a long time to hire your first salesperson, bundling strategy, and a ton of incredibly insightful career advice. A huge thank you to Elena Verna for suggesting Carilu for the podcast. And with that, I bring you Carilu Dietrich after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:56):
This episode is brought to you by Rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago, and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain.

(00:02:18):
Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools, and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter. Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce, or HubSpot directly into rows. And when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read, and embed charts, tables, and calculators into Notion, Confluence, or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:03:08):
This episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster. Let's be honest, it's a lot of work to build a company. And if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to be able to hire the right talent quickly and confidently. Braintrust is the first decentralized talent network where you can find, hire, and manage high quality contractors in engineering, design, and product, for a fraction of the cost of agencies.

(00:03:36):
Brain Trust charges a flat rate of only 10%, unlike agency fees of up to 70%. So you can make your budget go four times further. Plus, they're the only network that takes 0% of what the talent makes, so they're able to attract and retain the world's best tech talent. Take it from DoorDash, Airbnb, Plaid, and hundreds of other high growth startups that have shaved their hiring process for months to weeks at less than a quarter of the cost by hiring through Braintrust's network of 20,000 high quality vetted candidates ready to work. Whether you're looking to fill in gaps, upskill your staff, or build a team for that dream project that finally got funded, contact Braintrust and you'll get matched with three candidates in just 48 hours. Visit usebraintrust.com/lenny or find them in my show notes for today's episode. That's used usebraintrust.com/lenny, for when you need talent yesterday. 

(00:04:31):
Carilu, welcome to the podcast. 

Carilu Dietrich (00:04:33):
Thanks, Lenny. Happy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:35):
You've had this incredible career. You worked at all these incredible companies. I'd love to just dissect what you have found to be most important and effective in building a career long term, just broadly. And then specifically if you're trying to get to an executive role someday, what have you found to be some more important habits, behaviors, tactics, lessons?

Carilu Dietrich (00:04:55):
I'll start by saying that everyone has their own calculus about the trade-offs they want to make on pursuing their career and the sacrifices they might need to make versus the other things in their life, their family, their hobbies, their passions. And so I think the executive track isn't for everyone because there are a lot of trade-offs.

(00:05:14):
Because I think that some of the most important aspects of getting to the executive suite are working harder, learning more, pushing yourself, taking on more responsibilities and opportunities, maybe even in the white space, that aren't your job or aren't in your regular time. 

(00:05:34):
When I was young in my career, I decided I wanted to be a CMO. And at the job where I had decided I wanted to be the CMO, I worked two hours later than everyone else on the team. And I had this thought in my brain that two hours every day for five years would get me how many more years of experience than someone else? And I could do that when I was young, and I didn't have kids, and I was willing to make those sacrifices. 

(00:05:59):
But you look at a lot of the top CMOs and they have sacrificed a lot of things to read all of the books. And again, if I go back to that first job, I was a PR manager, and we went through a tough phase and we lost a ahead of product right before the major launch of a major product. So I volunteered to moonlight in the product department and run the beta, and do release engineering. And taking on other responsibilities gave me insights into other departments that made me more successful, early in my career and later on.

(00:06:33):
And the same thing happens as you're growing, right? If a department head leaves and you can spend extra time doing your own job and being the interim for this other function, you can really show the top executives that you have the appetite and the skill to take on more responsibility.

(00:06:50):
So I think learning as much as you can about your expertise, working really hard, and taking on more responsibilities, and having a great attitude and a strategic mind are probably what I think helps people get to the C-suite on the personal level. And then I have another set of five things that are what specific ways do you need to train your mind?

Lenny (00:07:15):
I know there's this backlash against working really hard that happened for a while, but I'm on the same boat as you have of success will come from working really hard. And sometimes that sucks, but that's usually how it goes.

Carilu Dietrich (00:07:27):
I think there's ebbs and flows in your life. You're going to have a baby here soon, congratulations. Thank you. And so maybe you take your foot off the gas for a little bit. But really, there's no shortcuts. There's no shortcuts to knowing a lot.

(00:07:43):
One of the people I admire most is Tomasz Tunguz, who was with Redpoint and now started his own VC firm. And I was talking to him about his blog and he was like, "I'd just wake up 5:00 or 6:00 AM every morning and write three to four blogs a week for 10 years." Damn. That is self-discipline and insight and drive. So yeah, no shortcuts. I think. You look at Denise Persson at Snowflake, and she's worked really hard to get there. 

(00:08:12):
So the five things I think you need to do to get to the C-suite that are not personal side are you need to think about how your responsibilities tie to revenue. You need to think and talk in the terms of the CEO and the board. And that can be tricky when you're junior because you don't have exposure to it. But getting a strong handle on finance, and how the finances of the business work, and how the revenue of the business works.

(00:08:38):
I went on a tour of the Tesla factory with my daughter's field trip a couple weeks ago. And the guy who was giving us the tour was like, "So I delivered and stocked all these different parts at the plant and then I would take a list. And after work every night, I'd go to each part of the plant and try to figure out what they were working on and what the challenges and opportunities were. And that's how I moved up."

(00:09:00):
So it's just understanding how the whole thing works together. Because if you want to be in the C-suite, it's a job about how the system works. So I really encourage tours of duty between different departments. I told you about my tour of duty and product. I thought CMOs had to do every function, so I took a tour of duty in every function in marketing, but really getting a sense for other departments.

(00:09:23):
The next thing is the relationships. So building really strong relationships with people by doing good work and helping them. And then the last thing I think is the quality of the companies you work for. So your career and your ability to transcend, which is really moving faster than other people to get bigger jobs, is fairly dependent on the momentum of your company. 

(00:09:49):
So I was a leader at Oracle for five years, and my team grew from five to seven over five years. And I was a leader at Atlassian for four years, and my team grew from 15 to 100. And so if you pick the right company with the right momentum, you have a better chance of getting higher level experiences and accelerated career growth.

(00:10:14):
And then I guess one little footnote. If you pick great companies, great people work for those companies, and go out and work at other companies and also give you opportunities. So I ended up at Atlassian kind of in a stroke of good luck because I had worked for Jay Simons, the president, at two companies before. So the quality of the first company, Plumtree, really helped propel my whole career.

Lenny (00:10:40):
There's so many things I want to double click on there. The last piece, it's the advice I always give people when they're early in their career is to go find a company that's going to do super well. That one experience is going to transform your entire career. Having the logo on your resume, the people you meet, the experience you get financially. But that begs the question, how do you find that? How do you pick a company? I think in your advising today, you join later where it's a little more obvious. "Okay, they're doing great." Do you have any advice or lessons about how to identify earlier where to go work and how to be lucky in that pick?

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:16):
Isn't that the billion-dollar question? So I worked for-

Lenny (00:11:20):
For investing too.

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:20):
Yeah. I worked at Atlassian, which was phenomenal. Then I worked for Classy, which was a company that helped nonprofits raise money. 

Lenny (00:11:29):
I've used that product.

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:31):
Thank you. And we were acquired by GoFundMe. And it was fine, but it was no Atlassian. And then I spent the next five years trying to figure out, how do you pick your next Atlassian? So my advice would be for people earlier in their careers, it's easy to pick the winners if you go work for a big company that's a winner. I would love to work for Tesla, or AWS. Or right this second, I would die kill for a job at OpenAI. You know some of the big companies that are successful... Salesforce has totally been a career maker to so many top executives.

(00:12:04):
So early in your career, working for big name high momentum companies. I think you can't wimp out. You've got to want it and go for it. And maybe you apply year after year, and you meet people, and you try for it early in your company.

(00:12:19):
Later in your career, I think what you just said, picking later stage versus earlier stage gives you a better view of their momentum. I actually have a Post-it note, got it here, about what I look for. 10 parts of what would evaluate to see-

Lenny (00:12:35):
You just have that Post-it note around?

Carilu Dietrich (00:12:37):
I do. It's one of five Post-it notes on my board.

Lenny (00:12:37):
I want to hear what the rest are too. But keep going.

Carilu Dietrich (00:12:44):
I have to look at it for advisory. I only take eight to 10 clients. I'm always full. And so it has to be a phenomenal company. So how do I know if it's a phenomenal company? Here's my list. Rule of 40, which is your profitability and your costs together. The quality of the investors. Are they really top tier investors? Are they mid tier or some you've never heard of? Investors do a lot of due diligence, but you also want to look at their most recent rounds, because they could have phenomenal early stage and have slowed down. I think the later the size, the more reliable, because they've just made it farther. 

(00:13:23):
Their Net Promoter Score or their customer satisfaction. Do people really rapidly love this product or is it like meh? Their net dollar retention, which is, how fast is their revenue growing? And I should have it on my Post-it note, but Snowflake was the benchmark. I think they were growing at 142%.

Lenny (00:13:44):
I think at one point it was 180, whatever.

Carilu Dietrich (00:13:46):
Yeah. That sounds right. 180, 165. Net dollar retention, if you have a customer and they just renew at the same dollar rate, it would be 100. So 180 is almost doubling just their customers. So they didn't even need new customers, almost doubled their business. A phenomenal net dollar retention means it's a really strong healthy business. 

(00:14:09):
I looked at their growth rate last year, their burn rate, are they going to run out of money? And then ideally, are they number one in their market? Do they have a Forrester or a Gartner Magic Quadrant? People tell you if they're number one. 

(00:14:22):
And then the last thing is I look at their Glassdoor. Is it just a bad place to work and where people unhappy? Because they don't actually survive as long as companies where people are happier.

Lenny (00:14:34):
I love this list. You should turn it into a blog post, and there's another idea for you. Can you share what the other Post-its are around you? Even broadly.

Carilu Dietrich (00:14:41):
I can. One says, "More Yoda, less Wonder Woman," which basically is ask better questions. The second one was-

Lenny (00:14:51):
Ask them backwards too.

Carilu Dietrich (00:14:52):
Yeah, right? Ask them backwards. Which is funny, because the other Yoda thing I have up Is... Here wait. "Do or do not. There is no try." Backwards. I have another one that says, "Hell yes or no." When opportunities come to you and you're like, "Should I do this or should I not do this?" You only have so much time in your life. And so if it's not something that really excites you and gives you energy, it's tough to be the best at it. And so hell yes or no.

(00:15:26):
And then the last one is, "Worrying is wasted energy," because I think we live in this economic pressure cooker, and there's a lot of fear and uncertainty. But we just need to take that fear and uncertainty and thank it for giving us urgency. And then make the list of what can we control now and what should we do next.

Lenny (00:15:50):
That's actually a perfect segue to my next question. And by the way, that was amazing. I'm glad that I asked about your Post-its. That's a whole life philosophy right there in Post-its.

Carilu Dietrich (00:15:59):
Yeah, I should do a BeReal. This is what is looks like at this side. These are all the Post-its.

Lenny (00:16:05):
Okay. So the question is around, I don't know if we're technically in a recession, but maybe we're on the verge of recession. The market's not great. And a lot of people are being laid off, or have been laid off, or are worried about being laid off, or just graduating college and looking for jobs. And I'm curious if you have advice for people trying to find a job in this market or just generally trying to accelerate their career. What is your advice for just how to deal with this environment while also trying to advance your career?

Carilu Dietrich (00:16:32):
I'd like to take in two parts. One is if you're unemployed and one is you're in a job. So if you're unemployed, it's tough. It's a tough time. There's a lot of supply. And so I think you just really need endurance and grit. And the sticker worrying is wasted energy, because you will get another job. It's just going to be a little bit more of a bumpy ride than some other years.

(00:16:55):
And the best executives I know have had down periods in their careers, where they were out of work for a while, where they were fired by a CEO, who this or that. And what they have in common is endurance. They're just back in the ring. So I think it's important to not lose endurance. 

(00:17:15):
It's also important not to settle on a crappy job or a crappy company. Each job you have prepares you for the next job, and each logo you have prepares you for the next job.

(00:17:27):
So I'd spent a lot of my career trying to also chase waves. My first job in college, I was in nonprofit, and then I wrote a book on the giving programs of the top 50 tech companies. And I realized that tech companies had a bunch of money in 1999, and were giving it away to charities. And I wanted to go into tech, because that's where the growth and money was. And I thought I could give it back to the world and good, but I could be inside the bubble. 

(00:17:55):
And then within tech, I moved my way to B2B. And within B2B, I moved my way to SaaS. And within SaaS, I've moved my way into dev tools, and collaboration, and now AI. 

(00:18:05):
There's this book called The Millionaire Next Door, which talks about how the very best antique store makes one or 2% profit. And the very worst oil and gas company makes 35% profit. And we know that some of the worst software companies make 65% profit. 

(00:18:25):
So picking your industry will propel your career, and picking the right company will propel your career, and then doing a good job will propel your career. So I think that there's no magic bullet to getting a job. But working your network, sticking with it, and continuing to grow your skills are the three most important things.

Lenny (00:18:43):
Big part of this conclusion is don't feel like your career needs to slow down in this period.

Carilu Dietrich (00:18:49):
And I think if you're in a job, some of my greatest career growth came in the economic downturns. In the 2000s, in the 2008. Because other people take their foot off the gas, and you can put your foot down. If you're willing to learn more, hit yourself into new roles or new responsibilities that no one's covering at your company. When they don't hire tons of people for everything, there's lots of open projects where you can raise your hand and grow. You just can't be as focused on title and salary right now. You're kind of building up value that you'll be able to monetize on the other end of this recession or downturn.

Lenny (00:19:26):
Let's segue to chatting about growth. And I thought it'd be fun to start with your story of running some very expensive ad campaigns. I know the founders are always kind of flirting with this idea of buying a bunch of billboards, running TV ads, maybe subway ads and bus ads. And you've done a lot of that and you've spent a lot of money doing that, and particularly non-digital advertising. And so I'm curious what you've learned from your experience and approach to this sort of marketing spend.

Carilu Dietrich (00:19:53):
Yes. I've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it actually. I ran global awareness advertising for Oracle, and did all of the airports, and the front page of the Wall Street Journal, on the back page of The Economist, and take over in the middle of Salesforce in downtown San Francisco. And we did the Ironman movie sponsorships, and the sports teams and arena sponsorships.

Lenny (00:20:16):
That sounds very expensive.

Carilu Dietrich (00:20:17):
Super expensive. And then Atlassian to a lesser degree, we spent several million dollars on different awareness campaigns to get chat noticed, or to associate Jira with the Atlassian brand. Advertising is sexy and super expensive for the benefits. It's a multi-year benefit of awareness. People have to see things many times, and it has to really resonate with them. 

(00:20:45):
So my advice to founders is that the most important thing is the quality of your product. Oracle spent a ton of money, and people still didn't like us in a lot of ways because they had poor experiences with the salespeople, or they didn't like Larry, or the product had kind of languished since it had been acquired by the company. So your product has to really be fantastic. And then also to do good brand advertising, it has to be sustained over a long period of time.

(00:21:14):
So Oracle had the front page of the Wall Street Journal, back page of The Economist, this boring advertising template with the red bar, but it made it memorable. We would do market tests, and two or three or 10 times more people would recognize the Oracle brand without the logo, because of the consistency versus SAP or or IBM. 

(00:21:35):
So you really need to be thoughtful about spending consistently over a longer period of time, and a smaller amount on a fewer number of things can be really effective. So Snowflake, for instance, has always gotten credit for doing a billboard on 101, and people think they do lots of advertising. But for many years, it was only the billboard on 101. It was just sustained and strategic.

Lenny (00:21:59):
So I guess two things that I take away from that is one, you can spend a lot of money, and if your product's not actually incredible, it's not really going to do much. And correct me if I'm wrong. And then two is sometimes, just one very targeted spend is worth a lot more than just blanketing a bunch of ads.

Carilu Dietrich (00:22:16):
Absolutely. I was telling you a story that at Atlassian, we did a big advertising campaign on our HipChat product, which was head-to-head with Slack, and it was an Office Space spoof with Bill Lumbergh. But the product had some uptime issues, and some feature issues, and Slack pulled ahead, and the advertising wasn't what would've made it or broken the product. It's really the product experience, and the advertising just amplifies.

Lenny (00:22:42):
I think you also shared with me this HipChat ad, that's maybe my favorite billboard ever. And I don't even know why looking back, but it made me laugh so hard. Back in the day, it was this meme of some early meme stick figure guy saying, "Why you no use HipChat?" Looking back I'm like, "Okay. I don't know how funny." But I think in the moment that was a really popular meme, and it really stuck with me.

Carilu Dietrich (00:23:04):
Well if you think about the best advertising, it's something that has a little twist of humor, or personality, or truth that sticks in your brain. So yes, that was a successful advertising. And kudos to my team, because of course I don't write it myself as the head of marketing. But yeah.

(00:23:22):
And some of my other favorite ads are also others that highlight the customer. So New Relic did an advertising campaign around data nerds. When data nerds were not really popular, they were still nerds. And they had these tattoos that said nerd life, and they featured customers on billboards talking about cool data nerds. And some of those campaigns that really stand out have something that's funny, unexpected, and then true to the product.

Lenny (00:23:54):
I remember those, one of the ads featured, our CTO at Airbnb, Mike Curtis, and everyone was very excited to see his face on the Billboards.

Carilu Dietrich (00:24:02):
Yeah, Salesforce has done a great job with those over the years too, really highlighting the customers.

Lenny (00:24:06):
So zooming out a little bit, you specialize working with companies that are going through hypergrowth. And you've worked with companies like Miro, Segment, Bill.com, which I don't know if people know is just a massive, massive business. And also 1Password. 

(00:24:21):
And on the topic of 1Password, interestingly I didn't realize how big and how fast 1Password has been growing. And just last week I saw this report from Okta where they have all this interesting data about which products people are using, and they put out this report showing which products you're getting the most new customers. And then on a different axis, which companies are getting the most users per new customer. 

(00:24:46):
And there's this six companies in this quadrant. Figma, Miro, Snowflake, Sentry, HubSpot, and 1Password, which blew my mind. And interestingly, you work with two of them. And so all that to say, what have you noticed about what is most in common with companies that are going through hypergrowth? What is most in common in terms of what has contributed to them being that successful?

Carilu Dietrich (00:25:08):
The biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use. I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. So Miro, whiteboards were the number one most uploaded asset in Jira forever. Because people all get together and they write their ideas on a whiteboard, and then they need to remember it and iterate on it. And that bringing that concept to life just hit a cord that people wanted to use. And when one person uses it, another person uses it.

(00:25:42):
1Password similarly, I've been a 1Password user for more than 10 years. We used it at Atlassian, as a corporate. And then they have the family plan. So I used it at home and then my dad got elderly, so I had a family that I was the administrator for, and then I go into different companies and you bring it with you.

(00:26:02):
And one of the other companies I advise is Productboard. And I became an advisor of Productboard because 1Password's CPO had it in another company, brought it into 1Password, rolled it out company-wide to get alignment and visibility on the product roadmap. 

(00:26:18):
So in order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company, especially in this economic efficiency market. So has to be an amazing product, has to have some viral activity. So we just talked about Miro or Atlassian. You could have an individual person use it and then they say, "Hey, I'm going to present at this meeting with Miro, come join me on my board. I've got these confluence pages we'd set up as a wiki about these engineering topics, and I want your team to collaborate on them." So those natural points where your users are selling to other people is way more efficient than having sales people that have to sell to other people. 

(00:27:12):
And then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. So hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years. They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200, they're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth. And then the people inside can be homegrown talent, but it's tricky to keep up. 

(00:27:46):
So my whole business is based on people who are trying to be homegrown leaders, but don't know what the next stage of growth looked like. And so a lot of hypergrowth companies hire ahead, hire advisors. Leaders need to really think about mentors and friendships of people who know what great looks like at the next scale, because it's going to be here before you know it. And so I would say those things. Amazing product, viral movement, and company that can ride the lightning.

Lenny (00:28:15):
I imagine founders listening to this that don't have insane virality or huge word of mouth are like, "Is there no path to being a really successful company?" And then I think about companies that did succeed with other channels, like say paid or SEO. And so I guess the question for you is, do you need to grow in this environment, I guess, primarily through word of mouth, organic reality, growth engines? Or do you still see opportunity for companies to grow other ways, say paid, or SEO, or sales eventually?

Carilu Dietrich (00:28:51):
For sure. All of the things are important. I think what I wanted to say first as you were talking was that it's easy to look at a company after they've been viral and be like, "That's amazing." I would like to start a newsletter. I have. It's carilu.com. Lenny has a newsletter. How can I ever grow like Lenny's virality? But Lenny started with one blog, and then another, and the consistency.

(00:29:14):
And when I look back at Atlassian, people would be like, "It must have been so easy to go from 100 to 500 million." And it never felt easy. It was a slog to do exactly what you're talking about. New features, listen to customers, strong SEO. Actually SEO was the number one marketing motion that we used, and SEM. We spent probably between 15 and 25% of our leads from paid search marketing at the time. Now I have a ton of customers that are pretty deep into account-based marketing.

(00:29:49):
Getting to virality and getting the hypergrowth is not a magic bullet. It's consistency, customer obsession, incremental improvements across all parts of the business. So I think founders just need to double down on having a product that's differentiated and does something that their customers really love. And each incremental step is a step forward.

Lenny (00:30:16):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcast, and to coordinate my sponsors. 

(00:30:35):
More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:30:53):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of the special limited time offer just for startups. Plan up today at Coda.io/lenny and get a $1,000 startup credit on your first statement. That's Coda.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.

(00:31:32):
Say that you as a company are seeing word of mouth in some virality, and you want to think about accelerating that, leaning into word of mouth. Obviously you want everyone to be talking about how awesome you are sharing with their friends. Is there anything that you've seen as a good way to lean into word of mouth and accelerate it?

Carilu Dietrich (00:31:49):
I think there's two or three things. One is really empowering the people in your company to be thought leaders. So early days, Atlassian's founders were on all the developer boards. And in fact, I remember, we were maybe 150 million or 200 million, and Scott Farquhar the CEO was still participating and going back and forth in different dev forums when I was like, "I don't know, should we elevate your status? Should we have evangelists and engineers that do this?"

(00:32:18):
And we did, right? And look, one of my clients now is Weights & Biases, the ML ops company helping lots of different AI companies with their ML models. And they have really thoughtful technical people who know more and write more on the blog and engage with their community. And that creates a word of mouth, because they're providing both a product and concepts and learning. That's one of the HubSpot secrets was all of their really thoughtful, helpful content, certifications for marketers.

(00:32:52):
So I think going back to summarize, word of mouth can be driven by thought leadership, which is hiring the right people to really be deeply engaged as super experts. Having a really strong content strategy that's either in communities that already exist, online communities, open source communities.

(00:33:13):
And then third I would say building your own community. So no one sells your product better than your own happy customers. And if I go way back to the very beginning of my career, I worked on a marketing team where I owned demand gen just for net new prospects, and a peer owned demand gen just for existing customer upsell. And we would have different field events.

(00:33:34):
And the existing customer ones were smaller than if we'd invited the prospects and had more buzz. And the prospect ones were very salesy. Whereas if we brought them together and you had customers talking to each other and prospects listening, everyone had a better time.

(00:33:48):
So Atlassian, one of our secrets was this amazing user group community where we just paid for beer and a pizza, and we'd facilitate local in-city leaders, and people would meet up and talk about our products, and talk about development generally, and grow their careers and grow their network. So I think those are the three. The right people, the right content, and the right communities.

Lenny (00:34:11):
As you were talking, I was reminded, I was just chatting with the founder of Gusto about their journey early on. And he said that for the first 200 customers, he sat there with them running payroll, watching how they react every step of the payroll process and how they feel at every moment. And that was a big part of what helped them build the product that people actually continue using, and love, and stick with. And if it wasn't in person, it was on a phone call. And it's like the epitome of doing things don't scale, just like for hundreds of new customers watching them use your product. Pretty wild.

Carilu Dietrich (00:34:44):
I mean that's the secret. That's the secret sauce. And I've heard some early stage startup advisors say that you should build processes that don't scale first. Because when you're in the super early stage seed A under 10 million, you've really got to go deep at that stage. 

(00:35:04):
And in fact, I see that that's one of the problems that companies experience as they get much bigger, when product managers can't meet with customers, or they get limited customers, or maybe they can only meet with a junior user, only the administrator, and not lots of the users. So that insight into the daily struggles and experience of your customers, it's harder to get as you get bigger I think.

Lenny (00:35:28):
I want to drill into Atlassian. You've brought them up a couple times. You were at Atlassian for a long time. You were there from early days of growth to IPO. And one of the most interesting elements of Atlassian and something that comes up a lot on this podcast is product led growth.

(00:35:44):
And Atlassian I think is one of the most classic examples of a product led growth company. And from what I understand, y'all waited a long time to hire your first salesperson. So my question is what did you learn from that experience about when is the right time to start leaning into sales and hiring sales, and what are the trade-offs of waiting longer or doing it earlier?

Carilu Dietrich (00:36:04):
Atlassian was a super unique company at a super unique point in time, because the founders never took outside money except for one late stage financing to buy out some early employees, to give some liquidity. So we never had VCs or private equity that had a voting share that was significant, that could overrule the founders.

(00:36:28):
So the founders were going through this experiment that turned out to be really successful, where they took all the money they would've spent on a sales org and plowed it into engineering and product. I'm going to pull up a slide here that tells the Atlassian story about the ratio of the sales and marketing to the product and engineering.

Lenny (00:36:46):
Amazing. And by the way, check this out on YouTube if you're listening to this and check out this slide.

Carilu Dietrich (00:36:53):
So this is a representative sample of what we did in Atlassian's history, and what ratios still exist today, even several years later. Where we spend way less on sales and marketing. Marketing spent less than other marketers. And also we had almost no sales org, or a sales org that was really focused on renewals, or now an assisting sales org that's focused more on enterprise. But relative to other companies, a much smaller, much more efficient sales org. And we took all that money and put it into product. So here we're spending two times, three times as many dollars in R&D as many other companies that we'd benchmark against to make a product that really sold itself.

Lenny (00:37:37):
It's interesting. So I'm looking at the slide. And again if you're listening, check this on YouTube because it's pretty crazy. This slide of bar chart of spend in sales and marketing and R&D, and Atlassian is the very lowest amount of spend in sales and marketing, and the highest spend in product. And it's interesting that it's from 2020, so it's not even in the early days. It's like still today basically.

Carilu Dietrich (00:37:59):
Right. I'm going to close this down and keep telling you a little bit more about it. There's some unique things that people can take now and incorporate. So the real strategy in sales, sales is the most expensive vehicle, right? Expensive people that spend a lot of time. So the Atlassian model was to sell only to people who were already customers really. If several people or a couple groups had purchased, we'd help them with their renewals. And now in the later incarnations of our sales orgs at Atlassian, it helps a lot more with larger enterprise companies who need enterprise deals, or does more cross-sell and upsell, but doesn't really do prospecting. Net new prospecting is a really expensive way to get new customers.

(00:38:51):
So we see different trends coming now with companies, because almost no one can do pure product led growth. Because your investors want to see accelerated growth, and most people believe that adding an SDR or adding an AE will add a predictable amount of revenue. And so it's difficult because product led growth and sales have to coexist.

(00:39:16):
But the whole transition in marketing that's happening to account-based marketing and intent-based signals is trying to do some of what we were doing at Atlassian, only to engage salespeople with customers that are actually likely to buy. And if you look at other hyper-growth companies, Airtable, Miro, both of those I know from the inside have had strategies where the salespeople really only engage after some threshold has been hit of number of users that have already been paying for the product on their credit card. But sometimes it's a high number of 20, 40 people at an account have to be engaged before a salesperson engages.

Lenny (00:39:54):
Based on that, what is it you recommend to founders these days that maybe are product led and just self-service [inaudible 00:40:00] oriented. Do you kind of take this experience and wait as long as you can to hire your first salesperson? I know it's very specific to the situation, but what kind of advice do you generally give?

Carilu Dietrich (00:40:12):
You and I are both like [inaudible 00:40:14] who was just on your podcast earlier this month. Product led growth depends so much on your product and your buying market. There's some buying markets that are less likely to use salespeople, and you need to go in from the beginning. HR might be one, right? Whereas a lot of the hyper-growth companies in the dev tool space can use product led growth because developers both hate failed people, and really love to research themselves. So you see [inaudible 00:40:47] taking off because people engage and kind of self sell.

(00:40:52):
So I would recommend, get closer to their customers and read the signals. If your product is good enough, the people can get time to value in a couple of days instead of weeks or months. You can have a product led growth motion. If your product needs to be put in context, and customized, and assisted, sales teams sometimes are expensive services arms to cover over product issues and help customers buy it until it's fixed. Or if you're in a market where your buyer just really doesn't buy online with research and a demo, then you need to have salespeople. But I would say try not to hire too fast and too far ahead in sales and inside sales, because it seems like it's going to add revenue, but it actually is a huge cost and a huge drain on the business if the product isn't getting that kind of resonance.

Lenny (00:41:47):
I just had a conversation with the founder of Retool for this series that I'm working on, and he basically found the same thing you found where they thought it could be a product led experience where you're building internal tools using their product, but it turned out nobody really understood how to do it themselves and it took a lot of handholding to make it work. So they became sales led from the beginning, even though it feels like a tool that has a lot of potential to be product led and self-service.

Carilu Dietrich (00:42:11):
I think the other hybrid I'm starting to see is people who turn their SDR, sales development reps, into sales engineers, researchers. So instead of having a salesperson who's like, "Would you like to have a meeting with another salesperson?" The first touch for customers that are maybe kicking the tires or trying a product led growth is a person who can help guide them on the path. And I like this hybrid nature because basically it extends product led growth, but helps people in this case where you're talking, where the product itself isn't so intuitive that you can get all the way to the buy itself.

Lenny (00:42:51):
It also sounds more fun to talk to a sales engineer than a salesperson.

Carilu Dietrich (00:42:56):
I know. I always wanted to be a sales engineer. I was a salesperson, and I crushed on the sales. Engineering team who knew everything and could draw all the architectures.

Lenny (00:43:03):
Oh wow, I didn't know that. A couple more questions around this stuff. So you've worked with a lot of different companies. And you kind of come in and help them figure out ways to grow faster, unlock growth opportunities. What do you find often gets most in the way of making big changes to the way they approach growth and approach different growth channels? And maybe on the flip side, what do you find is most essential to making big changes at a company around how they think about growth?

Carilu Dietrich (00:43:30):
The big growth levers are pretty consistent across companies. You start with one product, and you have a couple choices on how the go-to-market works. Product leg growth or sales assisted. You get a little bit bigger and you add an incremental product, or you start to add new segments. You're going to focus on a vertical like finance, or you're going to go global, or you're going to add new sales channels like a partner channel. 

(00:43:56):
And what I've seen with the big growth levers is that it can't ever be an individual department's goal without being a cross company strategy goal, if it's really going to make a difference. 

(00:44:07):
So you've talked about it in your newsletter and on your podcast, but growth isn't just like a person in the engineering team that hacks by themselves. It really has to be funded and thoughtfully constructed so that there's the right content and experience, and product features, and virality features a customer to continue to drive growth.

(00:44:29):
And similarly, lots of companies right now are trying to move upmarket because the economy has created so much pressure in S&B that they're going to try to move to enterprise, or they've trying not to sell as much just to tech companies because tech companies are under pressure and so they want to move to different parts.

(00:44:51):
Sometimes the marketers get blamed or sales gets blamed, we don't have enough leads. But really it's a company strategy problem where the company hasn't decided, "Hey, we're going to all move in this direction and if we're going to sell the enterprise, marketing's going to bring in leads, products going to have a roadmap, and some meaningful features to enterprise. The customer research is going to start thinking about them. We're going to hire some customer support people who know how enterprises work. We're going to hire some salespeople who sell differently to enterprises than S&B." The big growth levers are strategy problems, not individual departmental problems.

Lenny (00:45:26):
And what do you find needs to happen for that to change? Is that like CEO needs to be like, "Here's what we're doing, everyone get on board," or something else?

Carilu Dietrich (00:45:35):
I think it can come either way in the C-suite, right? So my job, I advise hypergrowth CEOs and CMOs of companies, 30 million to 500 million. Often if I'm advising a 30 to 100 million company, the more junior marketer with a CEO who's often a first time founder, who doesn't necessarily know if the marketer's good or not. Hasn't done run marketing before, doesn't know if they should trust what the marketers saying.

(00:46:04):
So often the marketer is saying," Hey, we're having problems because the company's not delivering on this promise you want us to sell." And sometimes the CEO doesn't know if they can trust it, a judgment. And so in that case, someone like me who's an advisor comes in and is like, "That's right, it's not a marketing problem, it's company strategy problem. Let's have an offsite and build some OKRs where we all go after enterprise and we win it together."

(00:46:30):
You'll see at bigger companies or when a new CMO comes in with more senior or seasoned, they'll have the social capital to push back into the executive suite. Or a new head of engineering who will say, "Look, I know you want to move ahead faster, but we actually have to catch up on this technical debt." And they'll push back and get that strategic space that they need. So it can either come from the CEO or it can come from the C-suite really coming together to solve those problems, instead of pushing them under the rug.

Lenny (00:47:01):
You touched on this nuance that a lot of times, there's not a lot of trust between the marketing head and the CEO. And I'm curious what you find helps build that trust.

Carilu Dietrich (00:47:13):
There's a couple things that are really critical for senior marketers, and I actually have a blog coming up based on a podcast I've recorded about why CMOs mostly get fired. And the issues are generally one, that the CMO isn't focused enough on the revenue. So some CMOs get focused more on the pipeline or the awareness, and the CEO doesn't feel like they really have a partner in driving the revenue. Or they don't feel like the CMO really has a handle on what will drive the revenue.

(00:47:46):
So marketing's tough because it's a big spend category, and lots of the spend doesn't convert in quarter. Some of it doesn't convert in year. Advertising campaigns, some take multiple quarters.

(00:47:57):
So it's really important for CMOs to have a handle on the metrics, a solid prediction of what growth levers they can use, and to be able to talk in the terms of the CEO and the board.

(00:48:11):
And I think that that's the biggest gap that I generally see. And then of course, there's a whole bunch of table stake stuff. They have to be running their business well. They have to be a good leader that people want to work for. They have to hire a great team that elevates them and the company, they have to be thoughtful and strategic about the market space that the company's in. They're not just working the levers in the factory. They're thinking, "What new markets should we enter? What new growth areas should we employ?" Like we just talked about. "What new companies should we acquire?" They also need to be thinking ahead. And I think being good on metrics, good on strategy, and good on market helps CMOs spar with CEOs in a way that builds trust.

Lenny (00:49:00):
It's interesting that you say, that blog post you titled Why Most CMOs Get Fired, and it connects with something. Casey Winters noted, that most CPOs also get fired chief product officers. I forget the quote, but it's something like, "The most you can help for is a couple swings at the bat before you get fired as a CPO." Why do you think this is so common for these chief C-suite roles to startups to not work out?

Carilu Dietrich (00:49:26):
They're incredibly hard jobs. The chief product officer and the chief marketing officer are both strategy jobs with difficult to measure results because some of them are direct and some of them are indirect. And I think both of them get swept up when a company's not performing well too. If company's not performing well, you can kind of swap out the head of product, and the next one will be more strategic and deliver faster.

(00:49:55):
And in fact, I've worked in one of the roles, the CFO was really after my chief product officer, and ultimately got him fired because he wanted to move everything offshore, and develop faster, and he didn't want to re-platform, and he didn't want to deal with the technical debt. And the CFO was sure that it was the CPO's fault, and then they got rid of the CPO, and the CFO tried his plan and it didn't work. And then you bring someone in who's like, "No, that guy had the right plane."

(00:50:21):
So both of them are tough jobs. And they require a high bar of excellence, a high connection of trust, and then I think just endurance to keep going and find the next role where you're really a fit and the company really has momentum.

Lenny (00:50:36):
It also reminds me, I was just talking to, I think it was Canva. Where their first engineering hire is now their CTO still, and their first marketing hire is their CMO still. So it does work out on occasion.

Carilu Dietrich (00:50:48):
It works out on occasion. And in fact, I've been playing around with a 10 part series about those CMOs in the CMO world, because there's about 10 to 15 CMOs who have started when it's really small and grown all the way. And they're the ones we really want to learn from. And I know a lot of them and really admire their work, and have learned so much.

Lenny (00:51:09):
You should absolutely do that. That sounds very cool. You talked about how you work with companies from 30 million to 500 million. What is it about that stage that's unique, and what happens after 500 million, and what's the difference before say 30 million? I know it's not an exact number, but how do you think about that range?

Carilu Dietrich (00:51:24):
No, it's not an exact number. My bottom number is because there's this early stage of product market fit where the founder and the company are trying to figure out who their real ideal customer profile is, and can they sell to them consistently?

(00:51:39):
So I've worked for some early stage startups where we've tried lots of different things, but they're not repeatable. You can't scale it. "This product works for this. This product works for this too and it works for this," but those are all kind of unique cases studies. And so my skill is in helping people scale. 

(00:52:00):
And so if they've already found product market fit and they've gotten some funding or they're bootstrapped, but have enough funding to really be trying to build out marketing in a marketing team, that's when I know what each stage looks like. So I know what $30 million great teams look like, and 50 million, and 100, and 150 million, 200 million. My ride at Atlassian was from about 100 to 500.

(00:52:26):
And then over 500, the act of going public, being an early stage public company, I know what that all looks like. And then beyond that, there's public company consultants I think more, that do more specific things. I more help the CMO and CEO structure for the next stage of growth, because they're going through it so fast, they haven't hired someone yet who's already seen.

Lenny (00:52:51):
Got it. One very nuanced question I want to ask you is about bundling. So there's HipChat and Slack kind of ate their lunch, not necessarily through bundling, but there's Slack. And then Slack, I don't know if it's true, but it feels like Microsoft Teams is eating their lunch with bundling. And I'm curious, what do you think of bundling as a strategy to win long-term? And also, how do you compete against say, a Microsoft that may one day bundle your product for free, and you might be in big trouble?

Carilu Dietrich (00:53:22):
I think it's two separate questions, so let me take them separately. The first is, what do I think about bundling? So small and medium-sized companies will go from being a single product company to a multi-product company in order to progress. Because you need a diversified financial model, because you need to be able to sell new products into your customer base who should already be friendly to you if they like your products. And because you need to really expand your total addressable market to get to be $1 billion or $2 billion company. But I believe in bundling is a growth strategy.

(00:53:57):
Specifically for product led growth companies, bundling is not a great land strategy. So at Atlassian, we had a number of products and experimented with different bundled lands. And it really slowed down the product led growth motion. So we ended up going back to land with a single product, high velocity, single person uses it quickly starts to get value, and then come in with other things.

(00:54:22):
So from that perspective, product led growth bundling is not very effective. Bundling for a sales led motion is pretty effective when you're at the right stage of growth. 

(00:54:33):
And then as far as the question of competing against Microsoft, there's these two parts of the philosophies. A best of breed and an all in one. An Oracle was an all in one, and Microsoft is an all in one. You can buy all the things and your CFO can get a discount by spending a whole bunch of money on a bunch of things. But in the all-in one, some of the pieces aren't as good as the best of breed.

(00:54:57):
And so Slack for a long time was the best of breed. People were willing to pay more because they thought it was markedly better than the other instant messaging options. 

(00:55:07):
But there's shifts between best of breed and all in one in economic wins. So right now, CFOs are putting the squeeze. Is Slack really that much better than Microsoft if the Microsoft one is free with all of our other purchases? It's tough. It's tough to go head-to-head with a powerful, big investing, all-in-one competitor. The only way to win is to be the best and have a product that's so much better, that it's worth the extra money.

Lenny (00:55:37):
Interesting. So essentially in a tough environment, bundling is most effective almost. And then this other interesting point about [inaudible 00:55:47], you want to stay focused on one specific pain point. What is it that Atlassian tried to do that they tried to pitch all your planning products in one suite? Is that kind of what we-

Carilu Dietrich (00:55:59):
Well, Jira was the issue tracking. And then we also had Confluence, which was the Wiki page. So let's say there was a business bundle that could have been HipChat, Confluence and Jira. Or there were developer combinations that could have been Jira, Bitbucket, and maybe Confluence too for an engineering team.

(00:56:19):
Basically, if you have to evaluate multiple products to purchase something, it's not a fast and easy online self-service buy. Because you're like, "Do I need all three products? Can I break them apart? Do they all work? Are each of them best of breed?" Whereas if you're like, "I need issue tracking, I'm going to buy Jira, this looks good. I've tried it out, I'm ready to go." That can happen in seven days. Whereas if you add in multiple products, it takes more days and just leads to fewer conversions.

Lenny (00:56:52):
That makes absolute sense. I can see someone thinking the complete opposite and then now realizing how we see. I see why this isn't working.

Carilu Dietrich (00:56:58):
You should always test it. Right? I mean, the secret to product led growth is can you test it? And so we tested everything. We tried bundles. We didn't try bundles. We tried different things in the bundles. We tried different days. Data led insights are better than anything any pundits would say on a podcast.

Lenny (00:57:17):
Amazing. Well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? 

Carilu Dietrich (00:57:22):
I'm ready.

Lenny (00:57:23):
Okay. What are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Carilu Dietrich (00:57:28):
The number one book is a life book called Tao Te Ching, the Stephen Mitchell translation. And the Tao Te Ching is a philosophy about the flow of life. And I love it. I've carried the Pocket Guide with me for 25 years. 

(00:57:40):
The second one is business focused. Never Split the Difference, which is a great book about negotiating written by a former CIA hostage negotiator, which also helps me with negotiations at work and with my children. So that's a great book.

Lenny (00:57:58):
Actually, I've been trying to read that book on audio. What's something you've taken away from me? Because the stories are so interesting and I'm always like, "What should I actually do in my day-to-day life?" What stuck with you?

Carilu Dietrich (00:58:08):
It's kind of the obvious thing that I wasn't good at. It's that you just really want to put yourself so deeply in the shoes of the other person, that you can figure out what make the win for both of you, right? Basically he says, "You can't win the negotiation by strong arming what you want. You really get to get to a win-win," which is probably every negotiation book ever. But he texturizes it so much. So I just felt like I was really able to... In my last office, we moved last year. I actually had the CliffNotes of his book printed out and posted on my wall because he had a series of questions to help you get deeper and deeper into the mindset behind people. 

(00:58:49):
And connected, but not connected the book How To Win Friends and Influence People, that's the 1932 bestseller, is basically that. People don't want to hear about you. They want you to be thinking about them. And then you can make friends with them, or you can negotiate with them, or you can get your hostage back.

Lenny (00:59:08):
I read How to Win Friends and Influence People when I was very young. And specifically, the chapters about there's no better sound in the world to someone than their name. Carilu.

Carilu Dietrich (00:59:19):
It's true. Thank you. You said it correctly.

Lenny (00:59:22):
Okay, moving on. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Carilu Dietrich (00:59:26):
My favorite movie is Everything Everywhere All at Once. It's basically a sci-fi about all the different ways your life could turn out if you made different choices. And it was really a mind bender that made me think about all the different ways tiny decisions have changed my life, but then also an appreciation for the life that you have. At the end, it doesn't ruin the story, but she has this love of what she has, even though it's not as good or as different as some of the other options.

Lenny (00:59:26):
I love it.

Carilu Dietrich (00:59:58):
So I bought this poster. I don't think you can see it on the bath, but it says, "Gratitude turns what we have into enough."

Lenny (01:00:07):
Very Buddhist. 

Carilu Dietrich (01:00:08):
I like it. Read the Tao Te Ching.

Lenny (01:00:10):
Not a Post-it, but art. Another teaching from Carilu. I think this needs to be a second newsletter of yours. Life advice.

Carilu Dietrich (01:00:20):
Which is funny. I've been thinking about that one. It would be called The Tao of Hypergrowth.

Lenny (01:00:25):
Oh my God. I love that.

Carilu Dietrich (01:00:26):
And actually, I was thinking about doing it and taking actual clips from the Tao Te Ching, and doing textural analysis about how it applies to our. I've been thinking about this actual podcast for a while because I used to want to do the... I mean blog, the Tao of Parenthood. Because basically parenting, you try to control and fix all the things you didn't do right in your life. But actually, it's the act of providing freedom that lets them go out and explore and then come back to your way of being. So, I don't know. The Tao Te Ching, I love it.

Lenny (01:00:58):
I see so many opportunities. You got to stop what you're doing. Just write all these things.

Carilu Dietrich (01:01:02):
I know. But I love the hypergrowth customers, clients.

Lenny (01:01:06):
All right. Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Carilu Dietrich (01:01:11):
So this is a little heavy, but it actually is my favorite. It's, "How many people have you fired? And tell me about each of the experiences." So the reason I ask this question is because generally, I'm managing teams of managers. And generally, I need people who have managed many people for a longer period of time. Or even if they're junior managers, how long and how many people they've managed is indicated by how many people they've fired. Because if you've never fired anyone, then you haven't managed very many people for very long, unfortunately.

(01:01:39):
And firing people is the hardest part of a leader's career. So how they talk about it, their compassion, and their need to drive the business, and the circumstances, "Was it layoffs? How did that work? Did you have to performance manage someone out? How did it work? Did you just have to restructure the team because of business goals? How did it work?" Gives you a lot of insight into their experience and their humanity in a way that they're not prepared for. So you really get the real story, and get a sense for what they would be like as a leader under a lot of pressure and difficult situations.

Lenny (01:02:17):
I've never heard that one before and I love it. Reminds me of a episode with Matt Mochary where we talk about how to lay people off really successfully and elegantly.

Carilu Dietrich (01:02:26):
It's a hard.

Lenny (01:02:27):
Yeah. Next question. What's a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?

Carilu Dietrich (01:02:34):
So I follow my favorite products to the companies that I advise. I love 1Password. I've got my 85-year-old grandfather and all of my family and friends set up on it. I love the cross-platform nature.

(01:02:45):
I love Miro and whiteboards. I joined Productboard because of this cross-company alignment and views into what's coming up on the roadmap, which is really the most important thing for the company. Momentum, as we talked about, having a great product and a great product strategy. 

(01:03:02):
And then I'm dabbling in all the AI things. I want to be excellent in AI visualization and art. I'm experimenting with Midjourney, but still kind of flailing. I've hired my 13-year old as my strategic advisor. And yeah, I'd love to work for OpenAI and ChatGPT. It's really interesting.

Lenny (01:03:23):
What's something relatively minor that you've changed in the way a product is built or just the company operates, that has led to tremendous impact on their ability to execute?

Carilu Dietrich (01:03:33):
On the product side, one of the concepts that I really like is the Amazon concept around writing the press release at the beginning of a product ideation. So one of the issues between marketing and product is the product will work so hard on something, and there'll be lots of different features, that it won't really be a theme that the marketing team can talk about. And then someone hands it to marketing and says, "Make this marketable." One of my mentors had this comment, "It's a bag of doorknobs." What do I do with this bag of doorknobs? Who wants to buy a bag of doorknobs? They want to buy the door and the concept.

(01:04:13):
So I like this idea of writing a press release. Start with the end in mind, and then negotiate. Is this good enough? Will this really resonate? Or is this really what we're trying to build? Or is this really the outcome we're trying to get with the product? So I've heard about Amazon do it. We experimented with it at Classy. I haven't done it at mass scale, but I love the concept.

Lenny (01:04:31):
Final question. I know you're a meditator. We've talked a little bit about your Buddhist nature. What's one tip for people that have been trying to meditate and just can't make it happen? What's your one tip for helping people meditate more often?

Carilu Dietrich (01:04:44):
So I'm a cheater because I was groomed to meditate. I don't remember how early, but I remember that the first meditations my mom had me listen to was a rainbow butterfly as I fell asleep when I was in kindergarten.

(01:04:55):
So I've been meditating my whole life, with mixed success. And the real secret is just that there's no right way, that there's no wrong way. That it's just making the time to be present, and breathe, and sense, and be here now. 

(01:05:13):
And so I use guided meditations mostly, because I'm not the best at quieting my own mind. I'm thrifty. So I use some free meditations. I use Tara Brach, who's a great meditator, who has short and long concept meditations. 

(01:05:30):
And I like this old one called Meditation Oasis, which actually isn't in publishing anymore, but it's still a podcast. And I re-listen to all theirs over and over. So stick with it is the secret to meditation, and any benefits you get from being present in meditation, hopefully carry over to be being present in life.

Lenny (01:05:51):
My whole body just relaxed as you were talking through all that. So you have a skill. Carilu, this was amazing. We learned how to grow products, how to live better lives, how to become more mindful. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out? And/or how can listeners be useful to you?

Carilu Dietrich (01:06:09):
Follow me on LinkedIn, or I have a new blog carilu.com on Substack. Thanks to Lenny for the inspiration. And I still have one more advisory slot open, and I'd love to work with more AI companies. I just joined Weights & Biases in the ML op space. But if you know of other great scale up AI companies, I'd love to help junior marketing executives or first time founders see what the next stage of growth looks like and get there.

Lenny (01:06:39):
Amazing. And again, if they are interested in that, how do they reach out to you?

Carilu Dietrich (01:06:43):
On LinkedIn or through carilu.com.

Lenny (01:06:47):
Amazing. Carilu, thank you again so much for making time and for being here. 

Carilu Dietrich (01:06:50):
Thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (01:06:51):

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00):
The goal of your Kindle strategies, these like non-scalable hacks, they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users.

Lenny (00:12):
Pinterest, Airbnb, Reddit, Canva, Hipcamp, Thumbtack, Fair, Tinder, Eventbrite. What do these companies have in common? Casey Winters, Casey has worked with and advised more consumer companies on their product and growth strategy than anyone in the world. He's also very generous with his time and often sets time aside to help founders and product leaders. I always learned so much talking to Casey, and I'm excited for you to hear this episode. In our chat we covered Casey's advice on making trade offs as a product leader, justifying non-sexy product investments, the spectrum of product people and how to level up your skills, new growth trends and tactics that he's seeing, when to focus on growth, and a bunch of advice on growth strategy, and so many other things. As a bonus, we're going to be doing a live AMA with Casey in my newsletter Slack community on August 5th at 10:00 AM Pacific time, so if you'd like to ask Casey any questions, make sure to get there. Until then enjoy this episode with Casey Winters. Hey Casey Winters, what do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (01:19):
Coda's a company that's actually near and dear to my heart because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create LKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it, so they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (01:56):
I actually use Coda myself every day, it's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, to organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners of this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement, just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

Casey, welcome to the pod. I feel like every time that we chat, I leave with at least one new perspective that kind of blew my mind on product, or growth, or even just the world. And so I'm really excited to have this conversation mostly to selfishly extract as much knowledge out of your head as I can in the hour that we have together. And so with that welcome.

Casey Winters (03:50):
Very kind, happy to be here.

Lenny (03:52):
You've worked at so many iconic companies and worked with so many iconic companies. It almost boggles the mind just looking at your LinkedIn, trying to scroll through LinkedIn and you have to click on, see additional experiences. And there's just so many places you've worked, so many companies you've worked with. Could you just give listeners maybe a 10,000 foot view of your career arc through product and growth?

Casey Winters (04:15):
Well, I started my career as an analyst at apartments.com on the marketing side, so it was my job to measure every channel for effectiveness in driving leads. These are things like SEO, AdWords, affiliate marketing email, so once I got good at measuring that I naturally started working on optimizing those channels directly. And then I started going to do user research and understand how the product could be better so that we could convert leads better. And it was at that point that I got the feedback from the company that I was this weird marketing and product hybrid, and they didn't really know what to do with that, because those were two totally separate departments. It wasn't until I got to GrubHub and I was the 15th employee and they were like, dude, we don't care.

(05:01):
As long as you grow how many people order food, I don't care if you work on marketing, I don't care if you change the product, do whatever we'll have results. And we now call these roles growth, but that term didn't exist at the time, so I basically worked on growing the demand side of that business from Series A to IPO. We ended up creating a product management function out of my team there, but for the first four years we didn't have product titles either. That was kind of a newer idea, also. It wasn't until I went to Pinterest that I was actually formally labeled a product person.

(05:37):
I ended up leading the growth product team there. We basically had to rebuild the growth model of the business to reignite growth, so I was there from 40 million MAU to 150 million MAU. And it was around that time that I started doing some more advising with Airbnb on the demand side, with Pocket. And then I went to a VC named Greylock Partners and worked with their companies on growth and scaling. And then I just independently started working as a full-time advisor with companies like Eventbrite, Tinder, Thumbtack, Canva. And after doing that for a couple years, Eventbrite opened this chief product officer role and they asked me to take it, so now I've been doing that for three years now.

Lenny (06:18):
That's an excellent segue to our next little segment that I want to get into, which is partly your CPO role and the work that you do there. And also touching a bit on a bit of the writing that you've done. You're currently a chief product officer at Eventbrite, which is a company that I love, I have so many friends there and they're all amazing, such a big fan of the company. And I know a lot of listeners are maybe thinking about becoming CPO someday as a goal.

Casey Winters (06:18):
Yep.

Lenny (06:43):
And so I thought it'd be cool to chat through some of the challenges that you're having and some of the things you've learned in the role.

Casey Winters (06:49):
Sure.

Lenny (06:50):
Cool.

Casey Winters (06:50):
Yeah.

Lenny (06:51):
I'll be more specific, so one of the things that you mentioned that you're working on is thinking about trade offs and being very explicit about trade offs you're making, communicating why you made certain trade offs and then just generally communicating that upward to executives and then across the company, so I'm curious just to hear what you've learned around how to communicate trade offs and internal communication?

Casey Winters (07:11):
Yeah, one of the things I found, especially during the pandemic at Eventbrite, where we weren't obviously hiring a lot of people and we had lots of various issues come up, is that a lot of managers and leaders would just try to deal with issues on their own and not raise them or escalate them with me in particular. And some of these were really tough situations, so then later on, I'd ask why something went wrong or why we didn't achieve a goal. And I get some feedback from my team of like, Hey, you don't understand the situation. This is really impossible. There's all these things going wrong. And then I respond. Yeah, of course I don't understand this situation because you haven't told me about it. How am I supposed to evaluate things fairly if you don't let me know what's really going on, so these people on my team thought that being a leader was handling it the best they could given the circumstances when in many cases the right way is to escalate the issue so that perhaps I could help them change the circumstances, so the circumstances aren't as dire.

(08:14):
And if I can't change the circumstances, I'm at least aware of the circumstances and the explicit trade off we've made to deal with that situation. And then I can help communicate that better to others across the company, and I can help evaluate the results with the proper context and do it more fairly. I find that in general people just way under communicate upward inside of companies. And then they'll complain that executives are out of touch when they aren't telling executives what the executives need to know. Then when people inside a company do try to communicate upward a lot of times they're so in the weeds that as an executive, I just don't understand what they're saying. And then when I ask questions it's like as an exec, I'm asking a question in another language. It's like I don't know if you've ever seen Ocean's Twelve, but as a joke, they invite Matt Damon to this business meeting and they just talk in code as a prank on him.

(09:14):
And that's what a lot of people on my team feel sometimes when they're talking to the executives of like, I don't even understand what these questions mean. It's like you're speaking another language. One of the ways I try to frame it to my team is if you're not an executive, whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one, which is what part of the company strategy are you working on? What metrics are you trying to improve? What assumptions are you making that are guiding what you're building? And I find that many times when non-executives are presenting to execs, they'll start on like chapter six, so even if that part of the story is right, it's like a good story. You haven't earned the right to tell that part of the story yet because you skipped the first five chapters. And I've definitely seen people with the opposite problem as well, which I call starting at the beginning of the time where you come into a meeting with the CEO or with the CFO or something.

(10:20):
And you basically spend the first 20 minutes, re-explaining the company strategy or who our customer is or something that everyone already knows. And then by the time you get to explaining new information, you've used up your allotted time, so I try to coach my team to be in the middle. Like don't start on chapter six of the story, but also don't start with a textbook on the English language either. You want to find the last point in your story, that would be completely obvious to the person you're telling the story to, and then go from there to things that would be less obvious, but that they can follow along with. And it's a lot of work to really dial that in across different types of people you're trying to communicate that story to because of course, upward communication isn't all that you're doing, right? You're trying to communicate that down to your team, to individual engineers and designers, and they're going to need to hear some very different things then say the CPO of the company, or the CEO of the company, so it's a challenge I see quite frequently.

Lenny (11:19):
Can you talk a bit about how you actually coach PMs on this? Is this like in one-on-ones you revisit a presentation they gave that could have been better? Is it after a presentation, you pull them aside and talk through what they could have done better. How do you approach that?

Casey Winters (11:33):
Well, I think the best way to coach is actually to do it before the meeting, so I think there's a tendency in product management and product design to want to do meetings where there's kind of this big reveal and an aha to the audience. And it's kind of the opposite of how you want to handle most of these situations. You want to de-risk that meeting not make it a big success or fail moment, so there's a few things that I do. One is if there is a big presentation coming up or something like that, I try to run through it with the team, pretending to be the other members of the audience that are going to be there, so I'll say, okay, well, what the CFO's going to ask about here is X. And you want to answer that question before it gets asked. What Julia, our CEO is going to ask about is why, so you want to weave that into the early story and not wait for her to ask.

(12:28):
You kind of role play the entire thing based on the different people that they're going to be communicating with. Something I commonly say is that executive communication is actually executives communication. You're communicating with individual executives that all have different styles and different concerns about the business or about the particular problem you're working on. And you want to anticipate that, and if you don't have enough experience say presenting to the CFO or the CEO, I as the chief product officer do, so I can impersonate them and help you understand what they're going to care most about. The other thing that I push a lot of my team to do is have pre-meetings with some of those key individuals, so that they're going to be less surprised in the meeting about what you're talking about, that you've gotten any major concerns brought to your attention before the big meeting.

(13:18):
And that helps de-risk how poorly a meeting like that can go, so definitely at the individual presentation level, doing that pre-meeting. What I'm working on a lot now is trying to have more of a scaled approach to training this type of upward communication. And what types of frameworks, what types of structure tend to work for Eventbrite and making sure that everyone on my team is just really well versed in that and comfortable in it because of course, confidence projection is a key part of these types of meetings as well.

Lenny (13:54):
This is such important advice that I think a lot of PMs don't recognize how important it is to prepare for important meetings like this. Just to give folks context, maybe that aren't doing this sort of thing when they're working at a larger company, how much time do you spend or an ICPM should spend on preparing for these things just to set a little bit of a reference point?

Casey Winters (14:13):
Well, it's an interesting question because I think different people have different styles on how they want to handle this. I'd say the way my brain works in these situations which I think is a little bit atypical, is I'm actually a little bit better if I am free forming a lot of elements and just speaking from confidence in areas I know versus specifically trying to lay out every exact bullet point I want to hit. I'm going to show up as more comfortable, I'm going to show up as more dynamic, and I'm going to be able to engage in a more thoughtful conversation, so for me, my approach to these sorts of things is I write a lot. I write a lot of notes. I write a lot of documents. And then in general, for any of these types of communications, I am just pulling from things I know deeply because I've written them down, I've thought a lot about them.

(15:10):
For a lot of other people they really just need to spend a lot of time on prep to make sure they nail the communication they want to nail. And I found it requires a different amount of investment for different people on my team, so the point is not as much how much time you spend, it's how well do you really know the material, and how well do you really know what your audience is going to care about with that material so that you are prepared for every question you might get. I'll give an example from my Pinterest days, the primary way with which you interfaced on any key strategic topic was product review, right? You'd go in and you talk to Ben, our CEO and Jack our head of product. And Ben and Jack had very different styles of communication. Jack in particular would very early on ask a few different data questions to get context on the problem. And if you, as a product leader or an individual PM or an individual designer didn't know the answers to any of those, it cast doubt on the entire rest of that meeting.

(16:17):
Because, the team wouldn't be confident that you had all the right context to understand the problem, so a lot of what I would coach my team on is, okay, I'm pretty confident Jack's going to ask this question, then this question, then this question. Based on the material I'm seeing from you, how well are you prepared to answer those questions? Different execs might be somewhat different in that regard, but if you haven't thought through all the questions that might be asked from the document that you're sharing or the presentation you're about to present, you're not prepared enough, right. You need to know the entire universe of how that meeting can go. And that may take you dozens of hours, it might take you three hours, but the most important thing is that you've asked what possible questions can be asked and am I prepared to answer all of those? Do I have all the data in front of me to answer all of those? But because if I don't the chances of the meeting you're having a negative outcome just increased dramatically.

Lenny (17:17):
I imagine some people are listening to this and they're like, holy shit, I need to spend this much time on preparing for meetings like this, but in my experience, that's exactly what you do need to do to be successful. And so this is real good, real talk about how long it takes to prepare for important meetings like the ones you're talking about.

Casey Winters (17:33):
Absolutely. I mean, for better or worse, the way that a lot of key decisions are made inside companies are through these types of forums and meetings. And it's an extremely high leverage piece of time for a product manager or a product designer in terms of how much impact they can have. And if you are under preparing for those sorts of things, the chances of you being able to have the type of impact you want, to have the type of career growth you want just go down dramatically. And I'm sure, you and I have definitely made mistakes in our career in important meetings in the past, but I think one of the things that I really try to do is learn from each one of those and make sure those types of issues wouldn't happen again. And now I feel like I have a pulse on, I know if I haven't done the work going into a meeting, that's going to make it have a more negative result.

(18:26):
And now I'm pretty accurate. And look sometimes you just didn't have enough time and it is what it is. But now I know, okay, I know I'm not quite prepared for this and it can go poorly as a result. And I know also when I've done the right prep and I'm ready for anything, whether it's a board meeting, or a meeting with the executive team, or a meeting with an external partner, right? And I think that's what you're trying to build as any sort of product leader, or PM, or product designer, or researcher, is that intuition of like I'm ready for this, I know everything that's going to come at me, I'm prepared for any eventual outcome. And if you're not, then probably the answer is spend more time to get ready.

Lenny (19:09):
Speaking of spending more time, another topic that you shared with me that you're thinking a lot about as a CPO is keeping the Eventbrite product simple while adding more and more functionality to make it more usable by more people and more use cases. And so I'd love to hear how you're approaching that because I know that's something every single product faces eventually assuming they keep growing, and survive, and keep adding more power.

Casey Winters (19:34):
Yeah, Scott Belsky who's the chief product officer of Adobe. He has this concept of the product life cycle you're probably familiar with, but I'll explain it to your listeners, which is users flock to a simple product. The product takes users for granted and adds more features for power users and then users flock to the next simple product as a result. And I've done a lot of research and work on this problem. And I found that there are a few different design hacks, essentially that companies use to try to avoid this cycle. One is okay if you build out more complex functionality, un-bundle it over time, like Facebook Messenger, Uber Eats have done, right? At Pinterest, we did a heavy investment in progressive disclosure, which is let's hide a lot of the more complex functionality until we make sure our users learn the really critical functionality. And then we can open up more of the full suite of the product.

(20:34):
Then there's just proactive training. You can get on a video call with your customers or a phone call, much more common in enterprise, obviously, or you might have a custom UI that goes away over time. That's giving you the training wheels. You can also segment experiences based on different user types, so certain users might get a very simple user experience and then some users might get the more complex one, and there's different packages and interfaces that cleanly separate the two, maybe that more complex experience also bundles in training. What I found is that just none of these really worked that well for the Eventbrite scenario, because we have different types of event creators across every possible level of complexity and sophistication. We have people that are putting on their first event and they expect five people to show up. We have people putting on a hundred events per year that really know what they're doing.

(21:32):
And then users also shift from one of those categories to another over time. They can get more sophisticated as they build up their business, so segmentation doesn't really work that well. Progressive disclosure doesn't work that well either because in many of these cases, we never want certain types of users to find the more advanced stuff, it's just going to confuse them. We strive for this concept of what we call perceived simplicity, which is there are advanced features in the product and they are easily discoverable when you look for them, but they're effectively hidden if you're not looking for them. And of course the majority of users aren't going to ever look for them, so the advanced more complex areas of the product don't make the product harder to use for the majority who will never need that level of complexity. And there are areas where we do this well and areas where we're still working on getting better, but that's really our aspiration.

(22:26):
The company that I feel like has always done the best job of this is WhatsApp, where at its core, it's a chat app and it's really good at being a chat app. But I remember when I went to Brazil, all of a sudden I started receiving voice messages and it was really easy to figure out how to use them and how to do them myself. When I needed to learn how to do video calls or phone calls, it would take less than a second to figure out how to use the more advanced stuff, but it's effectively kind of hidden if you're not looking for it. That's what we aspire to at Eventbrite. And in some cases we're doing well. And in some cases, we definitely have some work to do.

Lenny (22:59):
Is there an example of a win in that direction in the Eventbrite product that you're proud of using this model or even something that's like, oh man, this is really broken?

Casey Winters (23:08):
Yeah, we've definitely had some wins here on the marketing side of our products, so one of the bigger investments we've made recently is our creators do a lot of their own marketing to try to get people to come to their events and transact on Eventbrite in the process. But our event creators, they're not professional marketers, they try to figure these tools out, so we built a product that allows them to automate their Facebook advertising to get better results, supercharged by our data. And the product's working really well, but we found is that there are certain segments that, I want to geek out on this a little bit, right.

(23:47):
They want to figure out all the different target segments and optimize their creative, and then there are many creators who just want it done for them. We've been able to build some interfaces where the default is super simple, we'll handle the targeting for you, we'll handle the creative and then, Hey, here's an on-ramp if you want to get a little bit more sophisticated and do more of this yourself, so that's an area where I wouldn't say we've perfected it, but we've now really understood those different types of users and a have easy pass for both of them to be successful, so I'm really happy with that.

Lenny (24:22):
Awesome. Another topic that you wrote about that kind of touches on the stuff we were just talking about is justify non-sexy product improvements, things like stability, performance, developer velocity, things that as a PM leader, you're just like, no, no, no, let's just... The default is let's do that later, we got to hit our fricking metrics, we've got to drive growth. And you had some really interesting insights on how you think about justifying these sorts of things. And so I'd love to hear that from you?

Casey Winters (24:49):
The idea is that some of the most impactful projects that product teams can work on at scale, not early stage startups per se, but at scale are the hardest to measure. And because of that, they just get chronically underfunded. It's that old adage, what gets measured gets managed, right? For things like user experience, or performance, or developer velocity, or just a product area that's deemed un-sexy, like growth used to be back in the day, I walk through some examples of a few tactics that work to get around this problem, building custom metrics to show the value, being able to run small tests that prove the worthwhile-ness of the investment, creating some team principles that make sure you don't ever kind of forget about these important elements that can hurt you in the long run. And also just how to use experiments to build buy-in at the broader level.

(25:41):
And one of the main takeaways besides some of those tactics in being successful here is that you have to get a team to buy-in to this. You can't really do a lot of this work alone, right? If you're a PM, you want to be approaching this from a well, my engineering manager and my design leader also bought in that we need to work on performance or we've all aligned that the user experience is not going in quite the direction we want, and we want to head some problems off that may not improve metrics today, but could certainly decline metrics tomorrow. And if you can get a small team, what two, three people aligned on the importance of something that's deemed un-sexy. It's a lot easier to start to build this game plan around metrics or running small tests or structuring OKRs to not only prioritize this work, but to show some really massive impact. Which could then get the rest of the company much more excited to make investments themselves.

Lenny (26:48):
What I'm hearing is step one is just get your kind of peer leaders aligned behind something that may not obviously be something your leaders want you to do, is that right?

Casey Winters (26:59):
Absolutely, yep.

Lenny (27:01):
This episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I asked product managers and designers on Twitter, what software do they use most? Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, white boarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs. And that includes thousands of built in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer, visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up, that's whimsical.com/lenny.

(27:47):
Is there anything else that you think is really valuable, powerful, effective in just getting folks to getting your leaders to basically go along with some that maybe isn't going to move metrics or is that the core of it?

Casey Winters (27:57):
Well, yeah. I mean, definitely it's hard when you can't create a metric that they can understand. I think the other area to think about is when you're an early stage company, everything you're doing is trying to drive upside, like trying to drive growth in some way, it could be short term or long term, but you're trying to drive real growth for the business. But then when you've actually built a real business, a lot of times people are still in that same mode, which is everything is trying to add more growth on top of what we've already got. But when you're at scale, you can actually lose what you've built, so trying to help whether it's executives or just your manager, understand that this thing we've got, whether it's a high conversion rate or good engagement on this feature, it could go away if we don't do these other things.

(28:48):
And here's what it would look like if that goes away, that can be incredibly powerful. I think we were fortunate at Pinterest in this regard, in that we were a fast growing startup that stopped growing due to some changes in the market related to Facebook. And then actually once we had switched to growing primarily through SEO, there was an algorithm change that severely impacted our growth at one point in time, so that helped the company build more intuition of like we're not guaranteed the gains from all the things we've built in the past. We need to do things to protect them and protecting what we've got actually is increasingly important once you build scale, because now you've built something really valuable already. And yes, we want to make it more valuable of course, but it's hard to make it more valuable if you're eroding some of the gains you've already built, so that's another element that I think can be pretty impactful.

Lenny (29:41):
In your post on this topic you have an awesome chart of product market fit over time, illustrating the point you just made that it doesn't last and you have to keep iterating to keep your product market fit like you're by default falling behind if you're not continuing to push there, right?

Casey Winters (29:54):
Yeah. I think the concept is user expectations just continue to go up every day in terms of their expectations on user experience, on the value that they expect your product to provide, but also the competitive landscape in the market continues to get better. Yeah, if you're not continually pushing to make your product better, your user experience better, your latency better, then you're eventually not necessarily tomorrow, but maybe in a year, maybe in five years, you might find yourself fall out of product market fit entirely. And that's a really dangerous place to be, because then it's going to take a long time to figure that out and make adjustments. And then you probably have more technical debt to clean up, to be able to get back to where you need to be, where the market has reached in terms of expectations, so just doing work to make sure you never get in that situation is extremely valuable, in my opinion. It's something that I think a lot of teams forget about.

Lenny (30:54):
I think you're going to create nightmares for a lot of founders listening to this right now.

Casey Winters (30:59):
That's not the intention, but-

Lenny (31:02):
No, it's a kick in the butt. Another post that I definitely wanted to chat about. Maybe your SPST post, maybe I'm curious if there are others is around operations team, product ops and generally ops people.

Casey Winters (31:12):
Yep.

Lenny (31:13):
And this point that you made that ops is often a sign of inefficiency on a product team because in theory, a lot of the roles should be done by software, eventually. I'd love to unpack this and hear your take on this?

Casey Winters (31:26):
I think I originally got the idea for the post in that I had written another essay on MarTech. And how MarTech to be really successful, it's really got a target engineers more so than marketers. And that a lot of MarTech businesses just aren't very good businesses. And I think I got an invite to speak at a MarTech conference to a bunch of marketers about this post. And it's like, well, that sounds like a terrible idea. I'm basically telling a bunch of marketers that what they're investing in isn't that important, and that they're not the most important target customer. And I remember reading something about the conference that was like a conference for the growth of the marketing operations professional. And then I was like, oh no, that's not what I want in the industry at all. Like having marketing ops means you suck at marketing.

(32:18):
And obviously that's a bit of hyperbole. I'm not against the concept of a marketing ops role or a product ops role, we have a product ops team at Eventbrite, but as someone who ran a double digit million marketing budget at GrubHub without marketing ops, because we invested in automation and we invested in process, it scares me when the first tactic people go to is to add people to help scale. There's nothing wrong with people obviously, there's nothing wrong with operations people. The thing I have a problem with is normalizing ops as a distinct stable function where operations rules are amazing and how we utilize them at Eventbrite is their explicit job is to go find inefficiencies and build process or software to root out that inefficiency, so then they can go find other places to be more valuable. When you say, oh, their job is to do this manual process long term.

(33:16):
That's where I get super concerned because you're not rooting out efficiency in how you build your company. And that's where I feel like a lot of this can go if you're not careful, Intercom has a really good blog post on this from a while back around their business operations team. And they basically up front in that post say the goal of business operations is to not exist, and I definitely very much agree with that. I think in general functional ops roles, whether it's product ops or marketing ops or whatever, they're a hack to deal with some sort of functional issue on your team. And it's totally okay to have functional issues. Startups are going to have functional issues all over the place, but if the way they deal with that functional issue is by building larger and larger operations teams and roles. That's basically exacerbating an inefficiency issue, a functional issue, it's not fixing it. It's a form of empire building and in general empire building is something I don't have a lot of tolerance for.

(34:16):
You're making more of a function unable to operate without human intervention by saying the goal is to scale up marketing ops or product ops. Whereas what the goal should be is let's use our brains to run experiments, to make us more functional with less people. We're more efficient, we could add more value to the customer, and to the business. And if that means I don't actually need to have this product operations job in a year. That's awesome. And guess what, if you've shown you've done a really great job at rooting out inefficiencies. Every part of the company's going to want you to do some other job if that job is no longer valuable, because you've done such good job eliminating the need for it. There isn't this real concern that I'm going to lose my job by being too effective at it. It's like, no, you're going to show that you're just awesome at many types of jobs that product leaders or marketing leaders care about, so that's my perspective.

Lenny (35:09):
I love that. And this happened a lot at Airbnb, a lot of amazing office people ended up moving into other roles once the role was not necessary or they just wanted to do something else. And clearly people wanted them on their team because they were killing it.

Casey Winters (35:20):
Indeed.

Lenny (35:21):
One last question about the CPO role, and then I want to shift a bit to just product management and growth. What is the job of a CPO for folks that are just like, what the heck, what is this thing? What do you do all day?

Casey Winters (35:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (35:32):
And then what does it take to get there? Just like what should people work on most if they're trying to get to CPO someday?

Casey Winters (35:39):
First off, when you think about what's the job, the way I think about it is I'm responsible for leading and facilitating the development of products and features that deliver value for Eventbrite's customers that will translate into value for the business. And each of those words were chosen pretty carefully. Now in terms of the scope of the function, a CPO role can lead a few different sub-functions. In my case, I lead product management, product design, research, and growth marketing, but different roles have kind of some or not as many of those, it can be pretty custom depending on the size of the company and what the leader's skill sets are. To talk a little bit more depth about the role. I think it's my job to make sure Eventbrite chooses the best possible product strategy based on the information we have, that we can adjust that strategy as we learn and continue to build that feedback loop.

(36:35):
It's also my job to define and consistently improve the process through which we set our product strategy, how we prioritize projects, how we execute on them to make sure we're delivering that value to our customers, we're delivering those tangible business results. And to do that in a way where the rest of the company understands it and is able to participate in it as well, so this is things like identifying bottlenecks that prevent us from delivering value, or quality, or doing that at the detriment of speed, working with people across the company to remove those bottlenecks, making sure people outside of development are aware of what we're building, participating in the development and feedback of what we're building, as well as in helping deliver that for like a GTM perspective. And last but not least, and we've talked a little bit about this earlier, training the team on what it means to be an effective product manager, product designer, user research, et cetera, at Eventbrite.

(37:36):
And then of course hiring people who can augment our existing team on everything I just mentioned, so I'm accountable for what we build driving value for the business. And there's of course going to be many times where what we build doesn't end up driving value. It's hard to predict sometimes, but it's my job to improve that conversion rate and the magnitude of impact over time. It might not be that everything we build delivers value, but I want most of it to, and I want the impact of that value to be higher and higher over time. You also asked about what it takes to get to the CPO role. And I think my journey's been more irregular than most of the people you probably talk to. Product management when I started my career, it was all a waterfall. It was built around massive releases, it was a totally different job from what we do now. Marketing was a lot more agile in the lowercase sense of agile and it mapped to my mind better as someone who's really influenced by the book, The Goal.

(38:40):
I think the tangible pieces of advice to get to this level that may be helpful is I always focused on where I thought there was leverage. I wanted to learn everything I could and focus on the things that had a big impact regardless of the org structure or the career path that meant, I wanted to really have a deep understanding of the entire business so I knew just what was worth focusing on to help the business. I think one of the things that's different about being a chief product officer versus other product roles is how much of a company leadership role it is versus a functional leadership role. You're expected in this role to optimize for the entire company, even at the expense of what's good for your team, so you really have to learn how to optimize for company first. That's like a key thing to learn that I think new executives can struggle with. And what advantage I think I had is I've basically been working with executives since my first job at apartments.com, so I learned to speak their language and understood what they cared about pretty early in my career.

(39:47):
And this is a really important element, assume that questions from them are them trying to learn versus them assuming you don't know something and testing you about it. I find that a lot of people get intimidated by executive questions when the executive is just trying to understand things. And then that changes the interaction you can have. The other element that served me well was just refusing to specialize. I thought if I could learn all the skills that would allow me to combine them to work on the most important things versus only work on the thing I knew how to work on. And that definitely led to slower visible progress in terms of career growth or titles, but it was a much faster path to the true executive role because I could speak better with CEOs about more topics than most of my peers. Obviously this is all my individual experience there are many paths to get to this type of level, but those are some things that have worked for me.

Lenny (40:45):
That was such an incredible definition and so much good advice there. And this is a good segue to another area that you have a really interesting insight on around the spectrum of product people. When I think of you, I think of two by twos and this is I think just a spectrum, which is unusual for Casey framework.

Casey Winters (41:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (41:01):
I'd love to hear your take on how you think about the spectrum and around up-scaling PMs to move along that spectrum?

Casey Winters (41:06):
The idea is, and this is something I was inspired from talking with Omar who runs product at Cambly. He used to run core product at Pinterest. It's this idea of any product team is like a gang of misfits, they all come from different backgrounds. Most people didn't start as a product manager, their first job, they might have been in sales, or in marketing, or analytics, or engineering, right. Everyone's bringing these different skill sets to the table. But the main spectrum that I've observed in product teams of any decent size is that you have two extreme types of product managers per se, and on perhaps the left side of the spectrum you have the crazy innovator types, they have so many different ideas, they pay attention to every single change in the industry, they all know all about the latest Apple API or Snapchat's latest product feature.

(42:06):
Those people are going to have ideas all the time. Actually, probably most of those ideas are going to be bad, but one out of ten's going to be just a game changer and they're generally not super great at turning that idea into action. And then on the extreme right side of the spectrum will be your typical executional focused PM, and they can do a really good job of taking a strong strategy and turning it into action that creates value for the customer, but they generally don't know what's going on in the industry. They can't think of a totally new product idea themselves. They're going to need support from above to be able to push them in the right direction and then they got it from there. When you think about recruiting, what we all want as CPOs in terms of people we bring into our team is we want people in the middle. We want people who are strategic, they understand what's going on in the industry, they can generate some good ideas, but they can also turn it into something real that delivers value for the customer and the company.

(43:08):
And there just aren't a ton of those people in the world. Not as many as we would like to recruit, so as a product leader, if I'm airing on the side of which side of the spectrum I want people from, I generally will take people who are good at execution over people who are good at generating ideas, because of course there's always too many good ideas that a company need to focus and execute well on the best ones. Whereas if I were a VC, I would probably bias to the people on the left because I don't need every company to work. If I invest in 10 different entrepreneurs who have crazy ideas and one of them works and becomes the next Airbnb, turns out I've done incredibly well as a venture capitalist. The challenge you practically deal with as a product leader is you end up recruiting, and managing, and growing a lot of executional people who can get stuff done, but if they want to get to the director level or if they want to get to my level, they need to get more strategic.

(44:06):
And we don't have good ways to turn great executors into great strategists as in general, like a product function, so I've started investing in a lot of different things here. Obviously I've built some programs for Reforge around product strategy. A lot of my team goes to those to try to learn. I've also been doing a lot of mentorship with the team to try to teach them what it looks like to do that well. I've had people come in to speak with the team like you and many other great product folks to show my team what great looks like and how people like you developed your skills. And I'm trying lots of different things to try to move more of the team to the middle, where they can be that optimal strategist that still retains that ability to deliver great value on top of the strategy versus just have ideas that can't be executed on. And it's definitely a work in progress, it's a lot of different tactics to try to build that skill set inside the team and scale it. And definitely something I feel like I'm still working on.

Lenny (45:11):
What I'm hearing is a lot of kind of the biggest upside for PMs to develop is basically to become more strategic and all the things you've shared are just ways or a lot of ways to just become better at strategies. It's interesting that that's like what you found to be the most essential piece for PMs to often level up at.

Casey Winters (45:30):
Like you said, it depends on the level, right. Early on in your career as a PM, you're going to get the most value by showing that you can ship real things to customers and that the customers like them, like that's by far the most important thing. But if you want to start managing groups of PMs, if you want to start a running a business unit, or a pillar, or a theme. I as a chief product officer, I'm going to expect you to be able to write that strategy doc without me. And you know what I found, whether it's through the advising roles or through coming into Eventbrite is just a lot of people couldn't do that step.

(46:04):
And that means when you try to become a product leader at the company and the CEO expects that from you and you can't do it, you're going to set yourself up to really cap hard on how fast your career can grow. And you'll get stuck, whether it's at the senior product manager level or at the group PM level, because you can't show that you can drive decision making on your own and that you can push forward new ideas that are going to help the company, so that's definitely where I've seen the biggest bottleneck in terms of skill sets. Obviously there's lots of important skill sets you want to build as a PM, but that one to get to the top is the great filter.

Lenny (46:40):
That's awesome advice for folks listening that are trying to figure out what should I work on? It's kind of simple a lot of times just get better at strategy and it feels like it elevates you in so many other ways.

Casey Winters (46:49):
Yeah, and of course we could talk for hours about what it means to get better at strategy and some of the tactics there.

Lenny (46:54):
It could be a follow up.

Casey Winters (46:56):
Because I know some PMs who struggle with that.

Lenny (46:56):
Follow up.

Casey Winters (46:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (46:58):
Okay.

Casey Winters (46:59):
Podcast number two.

Lenny (46:59):
Podcast number two, let's book it. Okay, so I can't let you go without talking about growth. Everyone's always trying to figure out how do we grow our company?

Casey Winters (46:59):
Right.

Lenny (47:07):
What can we do to accelerate growth? I know you're modest, but I think you're one of the smartest people in the world on this stuff. And so I just want to touch on a couple things in the time that we have here. One is with paid growth becoming increasingly more expensive and difficult, especially with Apple's recent changes.

Casey Winters (47:24):
Yep.

Lenny (47:24):
SEO forever becoming more crowded, sales being always expensive. It's just tough out there for a lot of startups to grow. Are you seeing any interesting or new growth channels or tactics that folks can explore or consider that maybe work for companies that you're looking at?

Casey Winters (47:43):
It's not that there are new channels per se, unless you include tokens from like Web3, which I do not. It's more that there are ways to get leverage on your channels through better flows or lifetime value that companies are figuring out. For example, at Eventbrite, we unified what we're separate direct response and lead generation flows in our performance marketing to acquire creators. And now it just takes less effort, we're getting better CPAs and sales now has the opportunity to pick up any product qualified lead from a direct response customer who may need a little bit more help, and they have the data to now determine if there's high enough value to justify it.

(48:27):
This concept is being dubbed, product led sales. And it's this idea that you can unify self-service loops in a B2B business, which are typically driven by product and your sales loops into one more complex giant loop that operates more efficiently and breaks down the silos. And I think you're going to see an explosion in B2B companies that learn how to unlock that and get sales, and product, and marketing to be working as one larger cross-functional team and building an engine that optimizes all of their skill sets, so that's something I'm pretty excited about, but we're definitely in the early days there.

Lenny (49:02):
That's awesome. I was going to ask you if there's any trends you're seeing around growth and clearly that's one. Are there any other trends, just things happening in the growth world?

Casey Winters (49:12):
Yeah, sure. I think there was this conventional wisdom to just focus on building until you found product market fit and then you can worry about growth. And of course there's some truth in that statement, but now as I'm talking with more and more founders and I'm sure you're seeing this yourself, is we're seeing founders who are thinking about building growth loops into their product before they find product market fit. And it's not so that they can prematurely scale before they have product market fit. It's so that when they find product market fit, they have that built in distribution advantage to grow once they're ready. And founders are starting to intuit what I've written about a bit as well as you, which is that scalable acquisition or what we call an acquisition loop is a requirement for product market fit.

(49:59):
Like if you got a product that retains well and you can't find more users for it, I don't think that's product market fit, so it's really exciting to see that evolution and to see founders think about like it's not about getting a bunch of users before you have a product that works. It's about thinking strategically about how this product's going to grow itself when it's ready to do so. I'm really excited to see the next generation of founders build that muscle early on and also leverage it when they're ready instead of just like, oh, I'm going to throw a bunch of paid ads at it and it's going to work, so that's something I'm really excited about.

Lenny (50:31):
On that topic, when should companies focus on growth? And as a second question, when do you think they should hire a head of growth or someone full-time focused on growth?

Casey Winters (50:40):
Like I mentioned, well, you don't want to focus on growth before product worked fit. You want to be thinking about how your product can grow scalable pretty early on, so early growth definitely needs to be done by the founders. I tend to separate growth into two phases. I call the first phase kindle strategies, these are those non-scalable hacks to get your early users. And I think those are generally done by founders, maybe some early team members. Fire strategies are the ones that drive scale, that's what you were mentioning, content loops, sales loops, viral loops, paid acquisition. And to me, the goal of your kindle strategies, these like non scalable hacks they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users.

(51:24):
And it's once you unlock a fire strategy, that's when I think you think about hiring someone full time on growth to fully harness that new growth loop you've built. That could be a salesperson, if it's sales. It could be growth PM, if it's viral or you just see content. Or it could be a performance marketer if it's ads, but it's once it's like, okay, we've sequenced to a growth strategy that actually scales. Let's go find someone who's awesome at that who can make it 10X better. That's how I think about it.

Lenny (51:51):
Maybe a last question, is there is kind of an underappreciated or under invested in growth strategy, growth tactic, things that you're just like, oh wow, this seems to be working better than people may think.

Casey Winters (52:03):
Yeah. Well, I still think data network effects are underrated. I think a lot of people confuse the idea of data network effects with data as a product you can charge people for, especially like businesses. And I get it a lot of businesses like you can't charge them for data because they don't know how to use data super well, especially SMBs. But what data network effects are, is leveraging product usage data to make the product value stronger and stronger over time. That could be personalized results in the case of Pinterest or in the case of Eventbrite, better targeting data for advertising to find people who are more likely to be interested in your event. And I think especially with Facebook and Apple's platform changes your product being able to generate its own data, versus just relying on the big platforms to do all the work for you. That's a real edge that companies are starting to wake up to. And it's obviously something that's worked well for me in the past at Pinterest and certainly now at Eventbrite.

Lenny (53:02):
There's a couple questions that I had at the top that I skipped that I thought I'd come back to. I know that you're a big video game guy and I love that at the bottom of your post, you always share the music that you're listening to, so I was just going to ask what's the game you're playing these days. Anything you recommend and then what are you listening to?

Casey Winters (53:18):
Yeah, I'm currently playing Cyberpunk 2077 on the PS5, which is fun. But I recently finished Horizon Forbidden West and that was excellent, really great science fiction game. On the music side, one of my favorite bands is this band called Broadcast and they never really played live a whole lot and their singer died a few years ago, but they recently came out with a recording of a bunch of their live sessions that they recorded on the BBC. And it's like getting this time capsule from the past of some of their early live sessions. That's been really great, so I've been enjoining that record quite a lot lately.

Lenny (54:02):
Awesome. Casey's picks get them here, get them here now. Casey, I feel like I was successful in extracting many nuggets in our hour together, I really appreciate your time. Where can folks find you online and how can people that are listening be helpful to you?

Casey Winters (54:17):
Blog@caseyaccidental.com, I'm semi-active on Twitter @onecaseman, and always I focus on paying it forward, like help the next generation of companies, of PMs, of marketers, get better at their craft and build better businesses. And if you're searching for a cool event, check out the Eventbrite App of course, we always would appreciate that.

Lenny (54:43):
Love it. Amazing Casey, what a great way to end it. Thank you again for being here.

Casey Winters (54:48):

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Let's paint a picture of just what it was like to join Airbnb in your fifties.

Chip Conley (00:00:04):
I was mentoring Brian, but he was also my boss. I was 52, the average age was 26. I had to be both wise and curious, and often the dumbest person in the room.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
It's great to be in founder mode. It's not as great to be working for someone in founder mode.

Chip Conley (00:00:18):
Brian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration. His point of view is like, "Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock. Be there."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
Everyone's talking about, "We got to make the product better. We got to optimize this button, and improve conversion."

Chip Conley (00:00:32):
Isn't the product the homes and the apartments? Jobot said, "Nope. Product in the tech industry is something different." I just said, "Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
This whole story is a really good example of the value of having folks that are older.

Chip Conley (00:00:45):
When you have older brains connecting the dots, younger team members being really fast and focused, it's brilliant, and people won't notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
The Airbnb experienced led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy.

Chip Conley (00:00:59):
If you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. Midlife is not crisis. I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Well, let's back up a little bit, this near death experience. Today, my guest is Chip Conley. Chip is one of the most extraordinary and interesting people that you'll ever meet. He was a founding member of the board of Burning Nan. He was on the board of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. At 26, he started a hotel chain called Joie de Vivre, which went on to become the second-largest boutique hotel chain in the US.

(00:01:32):
After selling it, Brian Chesky personally recruited Chip to join Airbnb to help Brian and the company transform from a fast-growing startup to the world's most valuable hospitality brand. After leaving Airbnb where he was known as the Modern Elder, chip started the Modern Elder Academy, now known as MEA, the world's first midlife wisdom school, with large sprawling, beautiful campuses in Baja and Santa Fe. He's also written seven books, given a TED Talk, and is just a genuinely interesting and amazing human and friend.

(00:02:01):
In our conversation, we explore how to be successful in tech as you age, what he's learned working with and for Brian Chesky, including a lot of real talk, how to build a great culture at your company, his near-death experience, and how it changed the trajectory of his life, and so much more.

Chip Conley (00:04:38):
Oh, my god, Lenny, I sort of feel like I'm your father who's so proud of his son. My son has done so well, and I like to talk about, tell all my friends about you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):
Wow, I am honored. I'm happy that I'm making you proud, Chip, and I feel the same in reverse. We got to work together for many years at Airbnb. I got to learn a ton from you. I'm really excited that more people are going to get to learn from you from this conversation. I'm thinking that the way that we break up this conversation is kind of break it up into three parts, which are kind of the three arcs of your career. The three parts are your early career, building Joie de Vivre, your time at Airbnb, where we got to work together, and then talking through what you're working on now, the Modern Elder Academy.

(00:05:22):
I actually want to start with the middle chapter. I'm going to talk about Airbnb where we got to work together. Let's paint a picture of just what it was like for you to join Airbnb in your fifties surrounded by a bunch of 20 something, 30 somethings reporting to Brian Chesky, who is, I don't know, in his thirties. What was that like?

Chip Conley (00:05:41):
Yeah, I wasn't planning on doing this. I got a call from a woman named Natalie Tucci who worked at Airbnb, and said, "Brian Chesky and I've been talking about having you come in and give a talk. Are you open to that?" I was like, "Well, what is Airbnb?" This was 13 years ago, I think it was the end of 2012. Then Brian called me and said, "Listen, we really want you to come in." I came in and gave a talk about innovation and hospitality.

(00:06:14):
I think I didn't realize it was sort of a dress rehearsal for Brian to see whether the younger crowd there, I was 52, the average age was 26, would feel good about an old geezer like me with a bricks and mortar boutique hotel background, talking about the industry that Airbnb was disrupting. As it turns out, people liked me. Brian said, "I want you to come in and work 15 hours a week as a consultant. I want you to be my in-house mentor for both me, and Joe and Nate." I said, "Okay, 15 hours a week is great," and then within three weeks, it was 15 hours a day.

(00:07:00):
I was saying to Brian, "You're actually not paying me anything." He gave me a little bit of stock that would vest in six months and I said, "I don't know that this deal's working for me. It seems like the company needs to be a little more than you said." He said, "Yeah, I got you. I just wanted you to get in here and see what you could do." Long story short is I ended up going full-time. It was hard at first, Lenny, because I didn't understand the tech lingo. I didn't have any background. I was 52. I'd never worked in a tech company before.

(00:07:42):
I was mentoring Brian on leadership, but he was also my boss. I was the head of global hospitality and strategy, which meant initially, I was in charge of all the hosts in the world. Over time, that meant a lot more things too. I was involved in many parts of the business, definitely not the technical parts, but I think the hardest thing for me was just that initially, when people were talking about product, and Jobot said, "I'm the chief product officer," and I'm like, "Well, isn't the product the homes and the apartments?" Jobot said, "No, product in the tech industry is something different."

(00:08:23):
I had to be both wise and curious, and often the dumbest person in the room. It required me to have a certain amount of humility as well as to be reporting to a guy 21 years younger than me, Brian.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):
That actually, the point you're making there about what is the product I asked Laura Hughes, formerly Laura Modi, what to talk to you about, who we got to work together. She's the CEO of Bobbie now. You worked closely with her at Airbnb. She said this was the thing that stuck with her most about working with you is coming in and everyone's talking about, "We got to make the product better. We got to optimize this button and improve conversion, and product, product, product."

(00:08:59):
You're just like, "What is the product? I thought the product of Airbnb was the hosts, and the experiences, and the trips." I think that shows the value of someone like you coming in with different experience, and also older, and helping us communicate differently to hosts who also don't understand.

Chip Conley (00:09:15):
Well, there's an interesting thing also, Lenny, and you notice the difference in age between our hosts and our guests was probably about 10 years maybe. Over time, it actually got higher, because we started actually reaching out more aggressively to boomers and Gen Xers to be hosts. You had, I remember at one point, and again, let's get into a product talk here, I remember at one point, there was a conversation that was going on about taking Airbnb so it was mobile only.

(00:09:47):
Partly because back in the day, the two sharing economy darlings were Uber and Airbnb. Of course, Uber was pretty much a mobile only app. Airbnb started as non-mobile and then went mobile. Then it was like, "Oh, wouldn't it be interesting if everything was mobile?" At some point, I just said, "Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here to see how well they will be versed in managing their listing purely on mobile."

(00:10:18):
There were times where I was a voice for older users, in this case, hosts, that was helpful to guys and women in their twenties who were the engineers and designers and product managers. I always liked working with you. I want to just compliment Lenny for a minute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):
Oh, how sweet is that?

Chip Conley (00:10:41):
We did a lot of different things together, and what I appreciated was you had a humility to you that was different than a lot of the other product managers. There's other product managers, I'm not going to mention their names, and some of these product managers were very good. There were other product managers though who I found it sometimes hard to work with, because they expected me to know as much as they did.

(00:11:07):
I guess it would be, if the opposite side of that would be an older manager expecting a younger manager to have as much emotional intelligence, because emotional intelligence on average is something we get better at as we get older. I think the key for me to work in that environment and make it work was to not pretend to know things I didn't know, it was to have a sense of humor and humility in how I operated, and it was to show respect and hope that I got it in return. I don't know if you felt that way, Lenny. That's the kind of environment I tried to embody there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:45):
Absolutely. There's a couple of threads there I want to follow. One is just working for Brian. A lot of people talk about founder mode, and the power of founder mode, it's so great. That's how we-

Chip Conley (00:11:55):
Guess who-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
Exactly.

Chip Conley (00:11:57):
... populated that recently, that was Brian.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:01):
Exactly. It's great to be in founder mode. It's not as great to be working for someone in founder mode. Often a very challenging place to be.

Chip Conley (00:12:07):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
You reported to Brian. Also, you were just your own boss basically your entire career. You never really had to report to someone before. Also, he was in his thirties, you're in your fifties. What was it like working for Brian? The more real you can be, the better, because a lot of people always talk about here, it's like, "It was wonderful, I learned so much." Just like what was that experience? What did you learn from working for someone like Brian?

Chip Conley (00:12:30):
Well, let's start with the fact that I would never have gone to work for Airbnb if I didn't believe in Brian, because quite frankly, when Brian approached me and we started talking about it, I was like, I wasn't sure I liked the business model all that well as a hotelier. I had to believe in something beyond the business model, because I wasn't sure that the business model would work. Although soon after joining, I saw the numbers. I was like, "Wow, this is working pretty well."

(00:12:56):
I believed in Brian because the thing that Brian showed up with initially was just a curiosity and an appetite for learning. I remember back in 2011, when the big debacle happened with the apartment getting trashed by a guest. Brian decided he was going to go to find George Tenet, the former head of the CIA. Brian would go to experts and say to the expert, "I don't know what the hell I'm doing." He did that with me when it came to hospitality. I appreciated that a guy who had a lot of hubris, and Brian definitely has a lot of hubris, could also have the humility to say, "I want to learn more about this."

(00:13:42):
It's sort of a growth mindset. What was hard with Brian is, I'd say, three things. Number one is Brian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration, and he still has this issue. The beautiful thing about Brian is he's been very honest in the last couple of years on podcasts about his workaholism, and about the fact that the way he lives his life is not like other people. Back when I joined, his point of view is like, "Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock, be there."

(00:14:20):
It's like, "Really? No, I don't think so." I think the fact that Brian assumed everybody else was as one-dimensional in their focus as him was at times a problem, especially for a guy like me who was, I was in a stage in my career where I have a lot of interests. That was one. Number two is Brian admires and admired back then, Steve Jobs so much that there was a sense that as a guy who came from the product world, from the Rhode Island School of Design, he knew better than anybody else.

(00:15:05):
There was this, one of the challenges for a CEO sometimes, and this was my experience in my 24 years of running Joie de Vivre, my boutique hotel company, is it feels good when you feel needed. To come into a room and sort of see something, and then point out the things that are wrong makes you feel good. If you don't have emotional intelligence, that process can really piss people off or demotivate people. In Brian's case, I didn't have to deal with that too much, because he didn't understand, when I was starting, it was really, I was in charge of the hosts around the world.

(00:15:45):
Quite frankly, the idea of what's the psychology of the host? What's a host entrepreneur like? I went on a world tour to 20 different cities, and went and talked to hosts. I think I came back from that with a little bit of credibility with Brian to say like, "Hey, yes, our data science team and the quality folks who are doing qualitative interviews, they're getting something out of this." I actually went into the homes of these hosts all around the world, and I think I was lucky because Brian did less of that than he did with other people.

(00:16:19):
For the product team, my God, a product meeting with Brian would keep people up the night before, not just because they were actually working all night long to get prepared, but also they knew they would work all night long, because they probably wouldn't sleep in anticipation for this. That was another issue, I'd say. I'd say the other thing that, and in each of these cases, I think Brian's getting better. Just like Steve Jobs got better over time when he left and then he came back, he was much better when he came back, from all the people I've talked with who worked with him.

(00:16:53):
I'd say the third thing for Brian was the sense that adding a zero to something in terms of expectations, or thinking you're going to set a deadline that is unreasonable is necessary. If you don't do that, there's almost an underlying message that people won't kick ass on their own. There was a sense that Brian had that he had to maybe create ridiculous goals, because even if we hit half of that goal, it was very encouraging. What he missed in that was the fact that when you miss a goal, and when you have someone who has power over you setting the goal, or encouraging a particular goal, you're setting people up for a lot of stress.

(00:17:51):
At the end of the day, I think Brian is a generational leader as a millennial, and I think he deserves a lot of credit. Airbnb is as successful as it is, partly because of Brian's leadership. I would not have been there without him. Having said that, I had to hold my tongue in meetings sometimes when I saw how he was operating, because I wouldn't have done it that way. I think over time, I hope I had a little bit of influence on him in terms of how to apply some emotional intelligence to leading people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):
For people in this position, a lot of people work for founders, especially now that founder mode is a thing. Every founder is just like, "I'm the founder, you got to do what I tell you. It's founder mode. Again, this is how we win. We're in founder mode." You shared really good insight of building credibility as a really good lever to work better with someone like that. Is there anything else you just think as tactics to be effective with founders in founder mode?

Chip Conley (00:18:53):
Knowing what I know now, I would say, "Lenny, let's do a little pep talk, you and me before the meeting." I want you to start the meeting with the following as you present and Brian's in the room. "Brian, let's talk about what we're trying to accomplish here. Let's get really clear," and you probably did this, but, "let's get really clear on what both, what's the intention of this iteration that we're doing on the product? What defines success, and what do I want to get accomplished in this meeting?"

(00:19:25):
You start with that, because that actually helps to make sure there's alignment. Frankly, if there's not alignment, you might as well not have the meeting. Let's spend the rest of this meeting talking about alignment. That's what I would do, because that's something you can come back to over and over again during the rest of the meeting when Brian or the founder, whomever it is, is beating you up on something, saying like, "Well, let me tell you why it looks like that or why we're doing that." It goes back to that, the three principles or the three key goals we're trying to do with this product update. Yeah, so try to set alignment on the front end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:06):
That's an important tip for anyone working with anyone, even. I love just that that works especially well here. Then just going back to the credibility piece, what you shared there is you went on this world tour, not something everyone can do, but just getting really close to your customers, and using that as a, "Hey, I actually know what I'm talking about. You actually should listen to me even though you're the founder."

Chip Conley (00:20:27):
Yeah, I think the other thing is PowerPoint or whatever tool you're using, just be careful about being overly reliant upon it, especially when you have a combustible founder who may take you off path, such that your deck in its current order makes no sense at all. I always wanted to really limit the deck as much as possible, because I didn't know where the meeting was going to go. I wanted the decks helpful at the start, at the very start, to just set principles, set goals. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):
This whole story of you joining Airbnb in your fifties is a really good example of intergenerational collaboration, something that you're big on, just the value of having folks that are older working at tech companies. Maybe just talk about that broadly, and then we segue into other elements of your career.

Chip Conley (00:21:28):
I wrote a book called Wisdom at Work: the Making of a Modern Elder after my Airbnb experience. I did a lot of research. I was like, "Wow, so why do we have less intergenerational collaboration in the workplace, especially in Silicon Valley than we could use?" I started interviewing people, then I started talking to brain scientists, neuroscientists, and realized that a younger brain has fluid intelligence, tends to be fast and focused, really good at problem solving, very good at linearity in terms of looking at things.

(00:21:59):
As you get older, the brain shrinks a little bit and you have crystallized intelligence. In crystallized intelligence, what's going on is you're going from left brain to right brain more adeptly. There's a little bit less focus, a little more holistic thinking, systemic thinking, connecting the dots. You can imagine that on a team when you have older brains connecting the dots, thinking broadly, peripherally, younger team members being really fast and focused, and being able to think linearly how to get things done, that combination can either be successful or not.

(00:22:36):
When it's successful. It's brilliant. I think Laura, Laura Modi, Laura Hughes Modi, who was my director of hospitality, but also we worked in so many different capacities with her in the company, I loved working with her because her brain worked different than my brain. That's the opportunity is when you realize that diversity on a team, there's lots of kinds of diversity, but when it comes to brain diversity, not just with neuro diverse people but age diverse people, you get a benefit, an effective benefit that is not as noticeable, quite frankly, in some other diversities.

(00:23:16):
I found that over and over was really helpful. Part of my job sometimes was to find the blind spot. Again, if you are very focused, one of the things I said to Brian early on was, "I've seen the business plan. Now, I know the goals of how big we want to be in three years." This was very early in my tenure. I said, "But what we really have done, everything we're trying to do is to have no regulations and pay no occupancy tax." Now, hotels pay a bed tax, occupancy tax, we're not paying it, and we're trying to do everything we can not to pay it.

(00:23:51):
Knowing that, so for our listeners and viewers to know this, this is something that a guest pays. It's not the host who pays it, the guest pays it. It's part of the bill. If you go and stay in a hotel, there's a big, big tax part of the bill, but it made us more affordable by not having to have our guests pay taxes. Long story short is I said to Brian, "If we're as big as we're going to be three years from now, I promise you we're going to be regulated. I promise you we're going to be paying occupancy taxes. Let's take some proactive steps toward building a strategy for how we're going to be regulated."

(00:24:28):
That has consistently been Airbnb's biggest challenge is regulation in municipal markets all around the world. If we'd started a little earlier, maybe in New York, maybe in New York, it wouldn't have gotten to the point where it has been toxic in New York for the last dozen years ever since I was there. There's a few other markets in the world where it was like that. I would just say the value in having some age diversity, even when you have an older person reporting to a younger person, is it can be collaborative.

(00:25:02):
There was a guy named John Q. Smith, an engineer who I think you probably remember him at Airbnb. This is a guy who looked younger than he was, and he was a little bit nervous about telling people his age. The thing that was great about John is over time, he was not necessarily going to be the best coder at Airbnb. There was a whole new collection of coders coming in every month, but he became a great manager.

(00:25:32):
The beautiful thing about moving from the individual contributor to the manager, the person who can actually bring out the best in a bunch of younger people, who may be better technically than he or she is, but they know how to elevate talent. I call this invisible productivity. It's productivity in which you make everybody else around you better. That's something I tried to do with my teams at Airbnb. Ultimately, I had six different teams, five hospitality and five other teams reporting to me. I did my best to just be the kind of person who wasn't solving all the problems, but I was trying to elevate.

(00:26:11):
There's a woman named Lisa Dubost who is at Airbnb, and she, one day, the HR department was reporting to me at one point, and she was running HR. She was 25 and had no background in HR at all. One day she came in to me and she just said, "Chip, you are my confidant." Lisa has a French accent and fluent in French. She said confidant in just the right way. I said, "Oh, well thank you, Lisa." I said to her, "You haven't given me any juicy details yet. A confidant is someone who has the secrets."

(00:26:42):
She said to me, "No, in my part of France, a confidant is somebody who gives you confidence." It was like, "Oh, well, maybe that's what a mentor can be is a confidant, someone who gives you confidence and helps by asking questions, helps you as the younger mentee find your roadmap to success."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):
You're sharing a lot of really good examples of the value of older folks being within tech companies. Let me just ask you this, how real is ageism in tech? I ask because a lot of people that are hiring are probably thinking, no, no, I'm not biased. I'm going to hire the best person. If they're someone in their fifties, I'll hire them. No problem. It doesn't feel like it actually works out that way often. Just how real of a problem is this? What do you see?

Chip Conley (00:27:27):
Yeah, it's clearly a problem. I'd say it's maybe a little bit less of a problem than it was a dozen years ago, because I think a dozen years ago, it was almost a blind spot. In Airbnb, we had a group called Wisdom at Airbnb. It was an employee resource group for people 40 and older. There are lots of these kinds of groups that didn't exist a dozen years ago in all kinds of tech companies, which is good, because it means that there's a voice and a way to congregate with a bunch of people who are older.

(00:28:00):
Ultimately, we had these senior nomads come in and be like the voice of the customer for 10 weeks at Airbnb. It was the Wisdom at Airbnb older employee group that really actually pushed for this with Brian. The challenge is, in a world in which the smartest new people, especially when it comes to technical skills and engineering, are coming in with a whole new set of skills that an older person doesn't have, the older person is both expensive and may be perceived as slow. In the era of AI, it's a whole new ballgame.

(00:28:42):
The question, I think, will be if what AI cannot do is the human wisdom piece, artificial intelligence and human wisdom might be the balance beams here. Is it possible that older managers who have a little more emotional intelligence, a little more pattern recognition, a little bit more wisdom, can be a value to a company? The jury's still out. There's a New York Times article that just came out about the question of is AI going to wipe out older people's jobs or younger people's jobs? I think the answer is both, but the question is how bad is it for both of them?

(00:29:29):
I think what I would say to an older person, and when I say older, I mean like 45 or older, if you've done well financially and you're doing okay, the question you might ask yourself is, are you open, as I ultimately was with Brian in my fourth year at Airbnb? I took a substantial pay cut. I think it went down to 40% or 50% time, and my stock, my options were dropped to that level, my salaries dropped to that level, because I didn't want to work full time anymore. There are a lot of people who can be valuable in a company who have some institutional wisdom, some process knowledge of how to get things done in this organization.

(00:30:08):
In tech companies, that's really important. Airbnb, one of the biggest challenges that Airbnb has always been, how do I get shit done around here? Process knowledge allows you to understand, how do you deal with an org chart and get things done partly because you understand the motivations of different groups? That is something you build over time. Long story short is I just think that older people might look at their workload and say, "I'm willing to take a 20% or a 40% pay cut to go to 80% or 60% time," and the company is going to get their money's worth in that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):
That's a really interesting point, that if you're older and you're maybe less connected to the most cutting edge ways of building and coding, AI makes that a lot easier in many ways where you start to just talk to it. You don't even need to understand what's happening underneath.

Chip Conley (00:31:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):
There's a lot of listeners who are older in tech, there's a lot of listeners who are approaching midlife, let's say, worried about what happens to their career. When you look at people you've worked with and had at your academy, which we'll talk about, who continue to thrive and continue to have a really healthy career in tech, what do they do differently? What do they have in common that other folks you think should work on and focus on?

Chip Conley (00:31:28):
I think this idea being a mentor and a mentor and an intern, there's just the voracious appetite for curiosity. When I talk to someone who's a midlife and wants to be in the tech world or already is, the thing I say is, "Show up with curiosity and a passionate engagement for what you do, and people won't necessarily notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy." Energy has two parts to it. Energy is, they notice that you are not just sort of resting on your laurels, you have physical energy in how you do your job.

(00:32:04):
When people are like that, they're sort of timeless. They're age fluid, as I say. We talk about gender fluidity. Well, there could be age fluidity. They're not defined by their age. The other part of energy that's important is being positive. That's sort of more energetic, a little bit more California energetic. There's a sense of when someone's got good energy, you're drawn to them. It's about showing up with the kind of energy of someone 10 or 20 years younger than you, and then showing up with positive energy.

(00:32:38):
I think one of the things that would say I did well at, there's lots of things I didn't do well at Airbnb, but in terms of what I did well is I was very approachable. Over the course of time, the number of mentees I had, the number of people who just wanted to have coffee with me or tea, the number of people who just said, "Thank you for being in that meeting, you just sort of gave it a positive feeling," was really important.

(00:33:04):
My energy, both the positive energy part, and then also the fact that yeah, I could work 60 and 70 hours a week, and I could travel around the world as the Secretary of State of the company, which is what Brian called me a couple times on stage. The fact that I could do that meant that no one was looking at me and saying, "Let's get rid of the old fogey." Well, maybe some people the board, but I wasn't aware of them. I just think show up with that passionate engagement, that curiosity, that energy, the ability to be both the learner and the teacher, with respect for people that are younger than you, and you're going to probably do pretty well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):
That is really great advice. Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work, and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part.

(00:34:11):
In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, to documents and spreadsheets, lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI, all in one easy to organize tab. Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. More than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused.

(00:34:40):
If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time to try for yourself, go to coda.io/Lenny today, and get six months free of the team plan for startups. That's C-O-D-A dot I-O slash Lenny to get started for free, and get six months of the team plan. Coda.io/Lenny.

(00:35:03):
Interestingly, curiosity comes up a lot when I ask AI-forward people, what are they focusing on helping their kids learn most? Curiosity is the most common way to describe. At every stage of life, curiosity is something to cultivate. I want to go to the flip side of companies looking to hire. It feels like there's this untapped supply of awesome people that companies with ageism and tech aren't finding and hiring. To help hiring managers and companies take advantage of this, what's something you suggest they do? How do they shift their mindset or maybe shift the way they hire that might help them find these people?

Chip Conley (00:35:39):
I think we're moving into, there's a book that David Epstein wrote called Range, and the whole premise of range is that we are moving out of the era of the specialists and into the era of the generalists. I think AI is just accelerating this. As we are more reliant upon AI, and AI can be exceptional at technical skills and solutions really expeditiously, I think generalists, people who can think broadly, become all the more important. I think that what I would say to someone in HR or recruiting is beyond what I already said before, is the person passionate?

(00:36:23):
Are they curious? Are they a learner? Do they have good energy? I would also say, are they a generalist when they're a problem solver? I actually think that's going to be an increasingly important part of how effective companies think broadly. I think that's a key one. I think also, this idea of how do you create intergenerational collaboration in the form of mutual mentorships? One of the things I loved at Airbnb, there were a few people I did this with, where I had something to teach them and they had something to teach me.

(00:37:02):
A good example, my iPhone, so there's 97% of the utility of my iPhone that I probably don't use and don't know how to use. This was back in, let's say, 2013, 2014. There were people who knew iPhone or Google Suites back then. I'd never used a Google Doc back then when I joined Airbnb. There were people who could teach me something technical, and then they wanted to learn something from me, which would be like, "How do you want a great meeting," or, "How do you give a great employee review?" There are a lot of managers who've never been a manager before.

(00:37:45):
How do you disperse people like me in the organization so that there's usually not enough time for these young managers to come to some training session on how to do a good employee review. You sort of have to do it out there in the field. It's like apprenticeship back in the trades. You're an electrician apprentice, not because you're watching some video on it, you're out there in the field, doing it. That's a huge value in a younger company when you have some older people who have not been vested with the responsibility of managing those younger people.

(00:38:23):
They may actually be reporting to someone younger than them, but they're there to actually be support. In some ways, I think that was part of the unexpected value that I was able to offer to Airbnb and to Brian specifically, because there are a ton of people in Airbnb who were not even in my departments who would come to me and say, "I'm having a problem. How do I solve this? Can we spend lunch together?" I almost always said yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
I think the reason people did that in many ways is you just have a very unique aura of wisdom, and it's hard to replicate that, Chip.

Chip Conley (00:39:04):
Yes, and it all comes back to the curiosity. If I was just the older elder, dispensing wisdom, people would've gotten bored very quickly. I think the fact, yeah, I was on the board of Burning Man, that's cool. I show up as someone who feels younger than I am. I'm turning 65 this year. The bottom line is I think people lost track of my age, partly because I lost track of my age.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:38):
That's such good advice on the front end to be successful as a person kind of getting older in tech is curiosity, positive energy, the way you talked about it, passionate, engagement, is that the term?

Chip Conley (00:39:52):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:53):
Then on the other side is hire generalists. This actually comes up a lot in the AI conversations, just exactly as you said, the power of generalists reminds me, I'm going to this gym now, and the lady there is just like, "I love AI so much, because I'm just such a big picture person, and I am so bad at just getting, thinking about the details, and AI solves all that for me." It's like, "Here, here's what I want to do. I'll do this, move my house to here, here." It's like, "Here's what you need to do, step one, two, three, four, five."

Chip Conley (00:40:18):
It is remarkable. Since the time I've known you, how fast it has become dominant in our lives. Yeah, I think one of the last thing I'd say is, look, I'm privileged. For those of you who are listening or watching this and you're saying, "Well, Chip, you were 52 years old and they came to you. That doesn't happen to me. I'm not in that position." The thing I would say is, you're right, but I could have been plucked and brought in and partly as Brian's boy, people would've rejected me, because if I didn't show up the right way, it wouldn't have worked well.

(00:41:00):
There are lots of people who Brian brought into the company who didn't work well. I think the key is how do you get the foot in the door? At the end of the day, those second and third order of degrees of separation in terms of networking are still essential. The most important thing is to be able to articulate what you have accomplished in a new way that a recruiter says, "Wow." I really tell people I would love to see a resume.

(00:41:41):
First of all, the question that I think it was, who was it? Someone asked it, I don't remember if it was Cheryl Stamberg or someone else asked her, who said, "What's the biggest problem you're dealing with here, and how can I help you?" That's a great line. Number two is what I love to see is not so much what roles you've had, what bullet points do you have of your things you've learned? Give me, in a paragraph, a thorny problem you faced. What was the problem, and what skills you used to actually accomplish it, and what was the result of that?

(00:42:22):
I would love to see a resume like that. The older you are, the more you can actually have a resume like that. Then you can use that as the conversation piece when you're doing interviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):
I love that. I love that we're getting into interview advice and resume advice.

Chip Conley (00:42:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:38):
Speaking of thorny problems, and also why Brian decided to reach out to you, I want to go back to the beginning of your career.

Chip Conley (00:42:45):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):
Right out of business-

Chip Conley (00:42:47):
You're good at this, by the way. You're good at this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:49):
I was thinking ahead. Okay, so you're in business school, you left business school, you're like, "Maybe I should start a hotel." Something that rarely works out usually probably leads to a lot of money lost and a lot of frustration and just like, "Okay, what have I done with my life?" Worked out for you.

(00:43:07):
Ended up building the second largest boutique hotel chain in the world, Joie de Vivre, beloved. I loved every single experience I've had as Joie de Vivre. When you sold it, I was like, "That is so sad." Talk about just that story. I know this could go on for hours, but what's the-

Chip Conley (00:43:21):
Yeah, I'll be brief.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:22):
Yeah.

Chip Conley (00:43:23):
26 years old, couple of years out of Stanford Business School, working for a commercial real estate developer. I was bored silly. I wanted to do something more creative. Bill Graham, famous concert promoter, said to me, because I had gotten to know him, "What San Francisco really needs is a rock and roll hotel." I decided to start looking to find a broken down motel hotel that I could turn into a rock and roll hotel.

(00:43:46):
I found something in the Tenderloin, and turned it into the Phoenix, which became a famous rock and roll hotel that I have owned for 39 years now. Long story short is that was how I started Joie de Vivre, the company. We grew to 52 hotels around California, became the second largest, as you said, in the world in terms of the number of hotels, boutique hotels that we operated. I loved it till I hated it. In my late forties, I hated it, didn't want to do it anymore. The great recession came along and it was just kicking my ass.

(00:44:23):
I really went through a bit of what I now call a midlife chrysalis, but a midlife crisis, where I just wanted to change everything. I got through it. I had an NDE, I had a near-death experience where I had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic and I died. From that point forward, I realized every day is a gift and a bonus, and I decided to sell my company at the bottom of the great recession. That's really how I created this space in my life to be able to join Airbnb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):
Well, let's back up a little bit. This near-death experience, share more there. What happened there?

Chip Conley (00:45:04):
Yeah, so I write books. I've written seven or eight books, and I had written a book called Peak: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow. It was a book that Brian really liked, and part of the reason he wanted to reach out to me. I was on a book tour, I had a broken ankle. I broke my ankle at a bachelor party playing baseball. I ended up with a cut on my leg and the cut on my leg had fertilizer in it and went septic. I was on a very strong antibiotic and I died.

(00:45:39):
I went flatlined from the allergic reaction to the antibiotic. I saw, it happened nine times over 90 minutes, I kept dying, kept flatlining, yeah. Ended up in the hospital for three days. They finally said, "Listen, it's an allergic reaction, we believe." They thought it was a heart attack, a bunch of stuff, stroke, et cetera. No, it was the allergic reaction. I saw birds. I saw all this beautiful stuff. We don't have time to go into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):
You did? What?

Chip Conley (00:46:11):
I did. You want to hear this? Yeah, I saw this beautiful stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:13):
Let's do it.

Chip Conley (00:46:15):
I think there's a hotel in San Francisco called the Vitale that I built across the street from the ferry building, and it's still there, but it's no longer called the Vitale. In that hotel, there were these slippers in every guest room. One slipper said slow, the other slipper said down. I was wearing these slippers in my flatline thing, flying in the air in a 40-foot tall living room in the Alps, surrounded by birds that were tweeting and chirping at me.

(00:46:50):
I understood bird talk. I understand exactly what they were saying. They kept telling me, "If you slow down, you will see beauty and you will see awe." There was a bunch of other things, but let me just limit it to that and just say, and then the birds would say, "It's time to go." The birds would go out the big window into the mountains, and I would try to follow them. Right as I would get to the window, all of a sudden, I'd come back to life.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:20):
Holy shit. I love that there was a message inside of this experience. I don't know how many people experienced that. Clearly, this led to a big life change. It's interesting that a lot of times, you need something like that. You've been doing this for how many years at that point? Running Joie de Vivre?

Chip Conley (00:47:38):
At that point, I'd been running Joie de Vivre for 22 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):
22 years. It's interesting that you need something like that a lot of times. Otherwise, it just momentum just keeps carrying you forward.

Chip Conley (00:47:46):
Within two years, I'd sold it, and I had the chance to move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):
With building Joie de Vivre, something you've written about a number of times is just the way you built it is a really unique approach to building a business. Specifically, there's a huge focus on culture, which also came out at Airbnb. Talk about just why you see culture as such an important part of how you build a business like tangibly. A lot of people talk about culture, warm, fuzzy stuff, but you think about it very tangibly.

Chip Conley (00:48:15):
Culture is what happens around here when the boss is not around. The more distributed a company, the more culture is important. The boss is around in a traditional bricks and mortar workplace where everybody shows up at eight and leaves at six, and we all see each other. In my company, in Joie de Vivre, we had 52 hotels, and 25 restaurants, and four spas, and it was distributed. I couldn't be in all those places all the time.

(00:48:52):
Similarly, with Airbnb, Airbnb had offices around the world and it was a global company. The more distributed you are, of course, in the remote work world we live in, the more culture is important, and more difficult. When you're remote, there's these few cues you have about how we do things around here. They're usually in a digital, virtual format, which is why it's all the more important for you to have in-person gatherings of a team more often if you are virtual.

(00:49:27):
At the end of the day, the reason the culture is important is because it actually helps, it helps guide people in terms of making decisions, but it's also a magnet for the right kind of people. Oracle has a different culture than Apple, which has a different culture than Facebook. You can choose the place you're going to work based upon the culture. There are people who can be very good at what they do, but if they're in the wrong culture, they're in the wrong kind of environment, and they're not willing to shift to fit that culture.

(00:50:01):
We saw it at Airbnb all over and over again. In fact, Airbnb saw it, I think when with Amazon people. Apple people have resonated pretty well at Airbnb, Amazon people, less so. Those are two different cultures, Amazon and Apple. Therefore, understanding a culture before you even actually take the job is one of the more important decisions you need to make is like, "Is this culture a culture that I can live with and maybe influence?" There's language about culture fit.

(00:50:37):
I like to say culture add, because culture fit to me can actually be quite negative toward somebody who is the aberration. You have to fit in. Especially if this is a demographic thing, a person of color, a gay person, a person in a wheelchair, so you have to fit in. A culture add suggests that actually having some diversity on the team is helpful, because it actually adds to the culture. You still have to be able to get along in that culture. Culture is an intangible. That's the problem with it is it's hard to measure, but you see its value and you understand whether it's working based upon employee pulse reports and things like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):
You talk about having to understand the culture is such a key part of having success at a company. Do you have any advice for just how to understand the culture for someone interviewing? I don't know. You came in, you work part-time, it's easier to experience it all. Any tips there for, "Okay, this is for me, it's not for me?"

Chip Conley (00:51:39):
When you're interviewing, you're also interviewing them. When you're interviewing, it's not about you having to prove yourself. It's also for them to actually prove themselves as a company, and also try to understand if there is some alignment in the company. The kind of questions I would ask as someone who's being interviewed would be, what are three to five adjectives that define this culture? What's the biggest problem in this culture, in terms of something that's just endemic or baked in across the organization?

(00:52:14):
Is it ever going to get fixed? How could I come in and maybe help that? Which frankly, at a very junior level, you're not going to be able to help it except for in very minor ways. If you're a senior person, you might be able to help it. Those are the kind of questions I'd want to know. Frankly, if I'm asking that same question about what are the adjectives to multiple people, am I hearing the same thing over and over again? If I'm not, is that because there's not alignment? Is that because different departments have different flavors?

(00:52:48):
You could have a culture within a department that's very different than the overall corporate culture. The corporate culture certainly has an enormous oppressive influence, but you can be in a culture, a really great culture of a team or a department, in an overall company culture that's not good. In the long run, that oppressive company culture is either going to have to evolv,e or your department, you may lose people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:23):
When I reflect back on the impact you had at Airbnb, one of the funny things I think about is triangles showing up a lot on decks, and specifically rooted in Maslow's hierarchy, just like everything's this Maslow hierarchy metaphor.

Chip Conley (00:53:41):
True.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):
This one, I don't know, specific piece of this is you have this kind of model you think about for how to help employees be successful at a company. It's kind of rooted in your Peak book philosophy. Maybe just talk about that, and then if there's anything else you want to expand on with this power of thinking through the Maslow hierarchy.

Chip Conley (00:54:01):
Maslow's hierarchy, basically five levels. Later in life, he had a seven and an eight level model, but at the base is the kind of physical, water, food, air, and you move up to self-actualization at the top. To use this model as a hierarchy of needs for employees, customers, and investors is what the Peak model is about. The Peak, my book. The employee model is really simple. It's money or compensation at the base, recognition in the middle, and meaning at the top.

(00:54:39):
Now, there are some industries and some kinds of jobs in which money is 90% of the pyramid. Just because of the base doesn't mean it's not the dominant part of the pyramid, but the differentiation often is in recognition and meaning. In nonprofits, usually the money piece of it's rather thin. The recognition's this, and meaning's huge. Understanding how do you create an organization, and I gave a TED Talk in 2010 about this topic as well, how do you measure the intangibles of meaning and how do you create an environment where people feel a sense of meaning?

(00:55:18):
The customer pyramid, briefly, I'll just say that one, is meeting expectations is the base, meeting desires is in the middle, and then meeting unrecognized needs. I think one of the things that we did at Airbnb about a year after I joined, and when Jonathan Goldenhall was joining, is we really tried to ask ourselves, "Are we in the home sharing business, or are we in some kind of business that is even bigger and broader than that?" Ultimately, we came up with the idea that we were in the belong anywhere business.

(00:55:49):
Airbnb was not in home sharing, we were in belonging anywhere. Once you have that down, that was sort of the unrecognized need at the top of the pyramid. Then that becomes an organizing principle for how do you teach your hosts to create a sense of belonging? How does our marketing and advertising play up the belonging piece, especially and the everywhere piece, because hotels are not everywhere, but homes are? I would just say that this model, the idea of hierarchies is, I think, very helpful. Yeah, my book Peak has been around for 18 years, but I still am asked to give 20 or 30 speeches a year on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:30):
Oh, man. This pyramid of comp, recognition, meaning is really interesting, especially these days, because with all this AI researcher poaching, there's all this talk of just like, "Will people just go work wherever they get the most money, or is there a mission and meaning to the work they're doing that will keep them not taking a hundred million dollars offer?" Seems to be happening in a lot of cases, which shows you the power of meaning.

Chip Conley (00:56:55):
Yeah. If you know you're working for a toxic company, at some point, your conscience kicks in. Whether it's toxic in terms of the purpose of the company, toxic in terms of the leadership or the culture, life is too short.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:10):
Okay. You've had two major shifts in your career. You started the hotel chain, then you went to Airbnb. Most recently, the Airbnb experience, I imagine, led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy. Talk about what is the Modern Elder Academy?

Chip Conley (00:57:28):
Yeah, what is going on with that Modern Elder Academy? The Modern Elder Academy. There was a couple times where I was called the Modern Elder at Airbnb, and then I was told that a Modern Elder is someone who's as curious as they are wise. Jonathan Mildenhall, who is the chief marketing officer at Airbnb, used to call me the Modern Elder as well, and he said, "If you ever create a school, Modern Elder would be a good name."

(00:57:56):
We talked about it, and next thing I knew, I was saying, "Okay, this is called the Modern Elder Academy." We now call it MEA because elder is a fraught word on some level, it makes you sound elderly. What I really wanted to create was a place where people could come and do a workshop, they're five day workshops in Baja on the beach, or in Santa Fe on a big four square mile horse ranch, and reimagine and repurpose yourself, and navigate transitions.

(00:58:27):
We go through so many transitions in the middle of our life, let's say between, I define midlife as 35 to 75, guys. It's a very long life stage. We go through a lot of transitions. We are constantly evolving our purpose. We're building our wisdom. We have knowledge management tools out there, but we're the wisdom management tools. We're the tools that help us to get wiser over time, and then we need to reframe our relationship with getting older. Becca Levy has shown at Yale that when you shift your mindset on aging from a negative to a positive, you get seven and a half years of additional life, which is more life than any other biohack that's being done right now.

(00:59:08):
That's what we do, and we have 7,000 grads from 60 countries, and 56 regional chapters around the world. It's a bit of a movement, and I teach. I teach some of the workshops, and we have all kinds of famous people who come and teach. For me, creating the world's first midlife wisdom school just feels like the natural next thing for me to do. I love hospitality, so it's a very upscale kind of experience, but we have scholarships. I love retreat centers. I was on the board of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur for 10 years. I love wellness.

(00:59:45):
I've owned the Kabuki Springs and Spa for 28 years, which is the largest spa in San Francisco, and I love education. My book, Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder, gave me a curriculum in which we've expanded quite a bit with Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and UC, Berkeley professors helping us create a curriculum around midlife. That's how MEA came about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:14):
To your point, I forget who said, I think you said Jonathan has said this was a natural next step for you, I completely agree. It's like, looking back, this is the obvious thing you should be doing right now.

Chip Conley (01:00:22):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):
Also, I'm learning more things about you. I didn't know you were involved with the Kabuki Spa. I think Esalen and I knew, you just keep getting more interested.

Chip Conley (01:00:31):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:32):
There's a couple threads here I want to actually follow. This point you made about shifting your mindset to aging as a positive thing helps you live longer. That's such a powerful point. Can you just speak more to that, just what does that look like?

Chip Conley (01:00:43):
Yeah, there's lots of data points. I'll talk about two. One is this Becca Levy study, which has been going on for 15 to 20 years. If you sort of buy into the ageism of American society or Hallmark cards, when you get a card at age 40, 50, or beyond, there's a belief that life gets worse as you get older. If you can survive your midlife crisis, all you have to look forward to is disease, decrepitude, and death. The bottom line is there's a lot of things that get better with age. I wrote a book called Learning to Love Midlife.

(01:01:20):
The subtitle says it all: 12 Reasons Why Life Gets Better with Age. What I really wanted to do with that book, which is really, it summarizes the MEA curriculum, I wanted to write a book that sort of helped people to see the upside of aging, the unexpected pleasures of aging. They had a pro-aging, not just an anti-aging point of view. When you actually have a pro-aging point of view and you see the upside of aging, you take better care of yourself, both your mind and your body. You actually are willing to learn and try new things.

(01:01:51):
One of my favorite MEA questions is, 10 years from now, what will you regret if you don't learn it or do it now? It's a powerful question, really important question as we get older. When you're young, you've got all of your life left ahead of you. When I moved to Baja part-time in Mexico at age 56, I had a mindset which was, "I'm too old to learn Spanish. I'm too old to learn to surf," but when I said, "10 years from now, what will I regret if I don't learn it or it now?" I said, "Well, 10 years from now, I might still be living in Baja. I should learn Spanish, I should learn how to surf because we're right next to a surf break."

(01:02:29):
I did. What I believe is that anticipated regret is a form of wisdom, and it's a catalyst for taking action. That's one data point. The other data point is something called the U-curve of happiness, and it's been around for 20 years, and it shows the following. It has changed in the last couple of years because young adults are unhappy like never before. A 20 or a 22-year-old, really unhappy, 24-year-old, really unhappy.

(01:02:58):
Historically, the way it was is you were happy from 18 to 23 or 24, and then around 23 or 24, you start to see a long, slow decline in life satisfaction that actually bottoms out between 45 and 50. I'm sorry to tell you that, Lenny, since you're 44, but your mileage may vary.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):
You're saying I'm the least happy I'll ever be. That's only upside. That's great. Yeah.

Chip Conley (01:03:21):
Well, here's the part that's weird is that before this research was done, and it's global research across all demographics, what they found was starting around age 50 or 52, you get happier, so that you're happier in your fifties than your forties, sixties, fifties, seventies, happier than sixties, and the women in their eighties, happier than seventies. Wow. It's partly because we are in around 45 to 50, doing this thing called the midlife unraveling, what Brené Brown calls the midlife unraveling.

(01:03:55):
You're unraveling your expectations, what you define as success, your definition of what a beautiful body looks like, and you're liberated into freedom in your fifties and beyond. I can say that, yeah, I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience, and not wanting to run my company anymore.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):
You used this term earlier, the midlife chrysalis, was that what it was?

Chip Conley (01:04:22):
Chrysalis. Chrysalis, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:23):
Chrysalis. What is that? Is that kind of along the same lines?

Chip Conley (01:04:27):
If you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. It's that cocoon in which all of the change is happening. At the time, when you're going through it, it's like, "Oh, shit. My life is liquefying in front of myself." On the other side of it, there's a metamorphosis that happens.

(01:04:48):
I like to use the language, in fact, I have a podcast called The Midlife Chrysalis, because I want to help change the dialogue around midlife, so that the number one word attached to midlife is not crisis, but in fact, it's maybe chrysalis, and the idea that life is meant to be transformative during that era.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:09):
That is actually very empowering. I am sort of going through that, not necessarily in this intense way yet, but that might be coming. You said there's a bunch of upsides to getting older. It might be helpful just to share a couple of those things for folks that are like, "Oh, wow, I didn't realize that."

Chip Conley (01:05:23):
Emotional intelligence grows with age. Our wisdom can grow with age, although we know 70-year-olds who are not as wise as 30-year-olds, so it's a matter of what you do with your life experience. I define wisdom as metabolized experience, mindfully shared for the common good. What else gets better with age? You learn how to edit. You have no more Fs left to give, no more fucks left to give. That is absolutely true, especially for women as they age. You are more spiritually curious. The list is long, and so there are a lot of things that, actually, another one that I love is you're not compartmentalized.

(01:06:01):
When you're younger, you're compartmentalized. As you grow older, you are growing whole, and that means you're alchemizing curiosity and wisdom, introvert, extrovert, masculine, feminine, gravitas, depth, and levity, lightness. The people who I really admire who are 85 years old, they're so present and they're so whole. They are just who they are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):
There's a quote I found from you along these lines, the societal narrative on aging is just don't do it.

Chip Conley (01:06:31):
Fantastic. Yeah. We sort of say we don't want to age, but we do want to live. Quite frankly, aging and living are the same thing, as are aging and growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:44):
Coming back to MEA, just for folks that are interested, curious about this, who's this for, would you say? Who should seriously look into this program?

Chip Conley (01:06:52):
MEA is really, the people who tend to come to MEA are in the midst of a transition. It could be selling their company, leaving a job, getting divorced, having kids, becoming an empty nester, taking care of parents till they're passing away, having a health diagnosis that's scary. Average age is 54, and it's people of all walks of life. It's not just the tech industry, but it's very popular in the tech industry. It's people who are looking to maybe do a reframe of their purpose, and maybe even a reinvention of their career.

(01:07:29):
Yeah, the two campuses are just gorgeous. It's been called the Four Seasons meets Blue Zones meets the Esalen Institute, which I like. We have online programs too, and so you don't have to come to either of our campuses in Mexico, or on the beach, or in New Mexico. You can actually do it online.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:54):
Those three, yeah, that's the tagline. That's your tagline right there. Esalen meets Blue Zones, meets what was the first one?

Chip Conley (01:08:00):
The Four Seasons.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):
The Four Seasons.

Chip Conley (01:08:02):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:03):
Nailed it. Okay. I'm going to zoom out and take us to a recurring segment on this podcast. I want to see if this goes anywhere, AI Corner, and with AI Corner, ask guests, what's a way that you've found AI useful in your work or in your life, any kind of trick you've learned, any workflow, anything you've found useful?

Chip Conley (01:08:23):
Yeah, I have a daily blog. It's called Wisdom Well, and it's on the MEA website. When I'm looking for inspiration, AI does it for me, and ultimately, it gives me a first draft. That's good enough for me then to say, "Okay." There's times when I'm missing the inspiration. I tend to write really well in the morning.

(01:08:47):
If it's any other time of the day, I do not like writing creatively. If I have a deadline for tomorrow and it's five o'clock in the afternoon, it's like, "Okay, ChatGPT. I'm on my way to you." I tend to use ChatGPT the most because I don't know, I like Claude as well, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
Okay, awesome. I was going to ask which tool you use. What's your workflow there? Is it you use voice mode? Do you just type out, "Here's what I'm thinking about, write me a little drop blog post?"

Chip Conley (01:09:12):
The good news is that at this point, it knows me well enough and my blogs, and I've actually, it knows my weird sense of humor, so it's able to ape me pretty well. I'll just say, "I need a 250 word post on," like today, today's post was a post that ChatGPT helped me with it. I said, "I believe that there's a refrain that needs to happen with the soul. We tend to say, 'I have a soul, or I don't have a soul,' but what if my soul has me? What if in fact, my job is just to be this vehicle for my soul to go to the next lifetime?"

(01:09:56):
My job is to be this steward of the soul. I said, "Write me something around that." It was just a weird idea. Of course, not all my blog posts are so new age, and I like that. I write a lot on leadership, but that was one that within 30 seconds, I had a 250 word blog post that I then adapted, and there you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:19):
Amazing. Chip, we've covered a lot of ground. We've gone through your entire life. Maybe actually just the tip of the iceberg. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Chip Conley (01:10:31):
Yes. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Chip Conley (01:10:38):
My favorite book of all time, Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl in a concentration camp in World War II. When someone's going through a hard time in their life, I say, "Read that book. You'll realize it's not so bad, what you're going through." It also really speaks to this idea of despair equals suffering, minus meaning. I wrote a book called Emotional Equations that was a New York Times bestseller that spoke to this idea that what if you could take all of your emotions and turn them into equations?

(01:11:04):
Very engineering-minded of me. That's one. I love any book by Liz Gilbert, sort of the opposite. Elizabeth Gilbert wrote Eat, Pray, Love. Her book, she's on faculty at MEA. She teaches here. Big Magic is just a beautiful book about sort of how do you get in the flow to allow the genie to come through you. Her Ted Talk in 2009 was about the fact that genius is not about being the genius yourself. It's about being the receptacle for the genie to come through you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
I want to come back to this equation you shared. I was going to get to it, but I didn't, so this is a good opportunity to. There's a couple that are really interesting to me. This is, you wrote about these in a book. You have a bunch of these equations about living a happier life. The one you shared is despair equals suffering, minus meaning.

Chip Conley (01:12:00):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:01):
The implication there is if you want less despair, increase the meaning.

Chip Conley (01:12:05):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):
Or reduce the suffering.

Chip Conley (01:12:06):
Suffering, Buddhist philosophy, the first noble truth of Buddhism is that suffering is ever-present. If suffering's a constant and you have two variables, using some algebra, I guess, you know that if you have more meaning, you have less suffering. That's that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:25):
The other one that I love is anxiety equals uncertainty times powerlessness. Maybe talk about that one briefly.

Chip Conley (01:12:32):
98% of anxiety comes from two sources. One is what you don't know, and number two is what you can't control or influence, and based upon social science. You can create an anxiety balance sheet and create four columns. First column is what is it you do know about the thing that's making you anxious? The second column is, what is it you don't know? The third column is what is it you can control or influence? The fourth column is what is it you can't control or influence?

(01:13:01):
When you take free-floating anxiety and put it into an equation, it actually makes it more tangible, and you often are less anxious as a result.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:11):
Boom. Okay, so if you're feeling anxious right now, this is an exercise you can do and you'll feel less anxious in like five minutes is what I'm hearing.

Chip Conley (01:13:19):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):
Okay, excellent. Very, very good nugget of advice. Okay, let's keep going with the lightning round. Come back from our tangent. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Chip Conley (01:13:29):
Ted Lasso is, I'm a sucker for that show. When it comes to movies, I'm a total movie buff. We have an annual MEA Film Festival at our Santa Fe campus. I would say that the film that I'm most excited about that is coming out that most people have never heard of, it's called I'll Push You. It's the story of two guys, one of whom is in a degenerative health condition and in a wheelchair, and his best friend pushes him the 500 miles of the Camino de Santiago, and it's the relationship they build along that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:08):
Amazing. Very deep cut. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?

Chip Conley (01:14:17):
Yes. Hair growing material. No. Do you know Viori shorts? I sound like Scott Galloway because he advertises this, but Viori shorts are like, I just love them. They're just breathe and they're comfortable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):
I'm wearing Viori joggers right now. The one downside of Viori, not to make anyone mad, is they're kind of plasticky if you look at the material. I'm trying to like, I don't know, but I do love, there's nothing better. That's the problem. Anything else like this that is all cotton.

Chip Conley (01:14:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:51):
I'm a fan. I have many Viori, I don't know if they're called joggers, just, I don't know, weekenders or something. Anyway, love you, Viori. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find really useful in work or in life? I imagine you have many, but is there one that comes to mind?

Chip Conley (01:15:07):
My favorite one right now is your painful life lessons are the raw material for your future wisdom. The premise of that is that wisdom often comes through the school of hard knocks. When you're in the midst of a really challenging time, you are developing your future wisdom that's going to be valuable to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Okay, final question. You were on the board of Burning Man, or you still are?

Chip Conley (01:15:28):
I was.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Was.

Chip Conley (01:15:34):
I helped found the board of Burning Man. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):
Okay. No big deal. I don't know if you know this, I got married at Burning Man. We had an unofficial wedding there on bicycles, so it's really meaningful to us. I've been there four or five times. What's something about Burning Man that maybe people don't know, some inside story or a really unexpected piece of the journey? I may imagine there's a lot, but what comes to mind?

Chip Conley (01:15:55):
I would say the best not well-known thing about Burning Man is that Burning Man own owns a place called Fly Ranch. Fly Ranch is about 10 miles from Burning Man. Now, when you go to the Burn, the event around Labor Day, you cannot go over there. It's locked off. It's 3,400 acres. If you look at Fly Ranch, FlyRanch.org, I think it might even be, or it's on the Burning Man site, Fly Ranch is the opposite of Burning Man. Burning Man is this alkaline desert.

(01:16:29):
There's no living life there at all. It's very masculine. Fly Ranch is porous, and lots of desert grasses, and hot springs, and hot pools, and birds, and wild horses, and it's one of my favorite hot springs places in the world. Just check it out, and you can go there when it's not during the event. It's quite beautiful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):
It feels like it might've inspired MEA in many ways.

Chip Conley (01:17:00):
It did, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):
Chip, two final questions. Where can folks find you online, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Chip Conley (01:17:08):
Online, MEAWisdom.com is the website for MEA. My website is ChipConley.com, C-O-N-L-E-Y, and I'm on LinkedIn. That's really, from a social media perspective, the thing that I do the most. I actually take my daily blogs and put them on LinkedIn. Then what your community can do, just come say hi, come check me out. If wisdom's interesting to you, and I think wisdom should be interesting to everybody here, on the MEA website, at the very bottom footer, you'll see a bunch of free resources.

(01:17:43):
One of them is called Why Successful Leaders Value Wisdom. It is a free resource, and there's also a free resource down there called The Anatomy of a Transition. Those two free resources, understanding how to build your TQ, your transitional intelligence, and understanding how to develop wisdom are two, to my mind, two of the most important modern skills that we can have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:05):
It's funny when you say you're on LinkedIn. It doesn't resonate with me. Chip Conley on LinkedIn, posting on LinkedIn, something about...

Chip Conley (01:18:13):
I don't know. Why? Because I'm a little too Burning Man?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
You're just, yeah, exactly. It feels like that's not your vibe, but I love that you do it, because that's where the people are.

Chip Conley (01:18:21):
Oh, I put wild, weird stuff up on LinkedIn, and thank God somebody's doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:28):
For some reason, I don't see it. I need to fix that. Chip, this was incredible. Everything I was hoping it'd be, thank you so much for being here and for sharing-

Chip Conley (01:18:34):
Thank you, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):
... your wisdom.

Chip Conley (01:18:35):
I am so proud as I go back, like have your proud Papa who just loves to see you in your element, and I just want to make sure everybody knows the following. Lenny was so good to work with. Whenever you were assigned to a project as a PM, I appreciated it because I just knew that we were going to have great conversations. You're just an interesting dude.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):
Well, I appreciate that, Chip. That's going to be the beginning of this whole episode. We're just going to put that up front. Just kidding. That was awesome, Chip. Really appreciate it.

Chip Conley (01:19:01):

## Transcript

Chip Huyen (00:00:00):
A question that get asked a lot and a lot is, "How do we keep up to date with the latest AI news?" Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news? If you talk to the users who understand what they want or they don't want, look into the feedback, then you can actually improve the application way, way, way more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
A lot of companies are building AI products. A lot of companies are not having a good time building AI products.

Chip Huyen (00:00:19):
We are in an ideal crisis. Now, we have all this really cool tools to do everything from scratch and have new design. It can have you write code. You can have new website. So in theory, we should see a lot more, but at the same time, people are somehow stuck. They don't know what to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
All this AI hype, the data is actually showing most companies try it, doesn't do a lot. They stop. What do you think is the gap here?

Chip Huyen (00:00:38):
It's really hard to measure productivity. So, I do ask people to ask their managers, "Would you rather give everyone on the team very expensive coding agent subscriptions or you get an extra head count?" Almost every one, the managers will say head count. But if you ask VP level or someone who manage a lot of teams, they would say, "Want AI assistant." Because as managers, you are still growing, so for you having one HR head count is big. Whereas for executives, maybe you have more business metrics that you care about. So you actually think about what actually drive productivity metrics for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:11):
Today, my guest is Chip Huyen. Unlike a lot of people who share insights into building great AI products and where things are heading, Chip has built multiple successful AI products, platforms, tools. Chip was a core developer on NVIDIA's NeMo platform, an AI researcher at Netflix. She taught machine learning at Stanford. She's also a two-time founder and the author of two of the most popular books in the world of AI, including her most recent book called AI Engineering, which has been the most read book on the O'Reilly platform since its launch.

(00:01:41):
She's also gotten to work with a lot of enterprises on their AI strategies, and so she gets to see what's actually happening on the ground inside a lot of different companies. In our conversation, Chip explains a lot of the basics like, what exactly does pre-training and post-training look like? What is RAG? What is reinforcement learning? What is RLHF? We also get into everything she's learned about how to build great AI products, including what people think it takes and what it actually takes. We talk about the most common pitfalls that companies run into, where she's seeing the most productivity gains and so much more.

(00:02:12):

Chip Huyen (00:04:34):
Hi, Lenny. I've been a big fan of the podcast for a while, so I'm really excited to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):
I want to start with this table/chart that you shared on LinkedIn a while ago that went super viral, and I think it went super viral because it hit a nerve with a lot of people. Let me just read this and we'll show this on YouTube for people that are watching. So it's this very simple table you shared of what people think will improve AI apps and what actually improves AI apps. What people think will improve AI apps, staying up to date with the latest AI news, adopting the newest agentic framework, agonizing about what vector databases to use, constantly evaluating what model is smarter, fine-tuning a model. And then you have what actually improves AI apps, talking to users, building more reliable platforms, preparing better data, optimizing end-to-end workflows, writing better prompts. Why do you think this hit such a nerve with people? If you had to boil it down, what do you think people are missing about building successful AI apps?

Chip Huyen (00:05:30):
[inaudible 00:05:30] question that get asked a lot and a lot is that, "How do we keep up to date with the latest AI news?" I'm like, "Why? Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news?" I know it sound very counter-intuitive, but there's just so much news out there. A lot of people also ask me questions like, "How do I choose between two different technologies?" Maybe like recently, MCP versus agent-to-agent protocol? And it was like, "Which one is better or this or that?" I think it's a [inaudible 00:05:59] question you should ask them is like, "First, how much of the improvement could you get from optimal solutions versus non-optimal solutions?" Right? And sometimes they were like, "Actually, it's not much." Right?

(00:06:10):
I was like, "Okay, if it's not much improvement, then why do you want to spend so much time debating something that doesn't make that much difference to your performance?" Another question they ask is like, "If you adopted a new technology, how hard it could be to switch that out to another?" And sometimes they will like, "Oh, I think it could be a lot of work switching it out." And I'm just like, "Hmm, let's say here's a new technology. It hasn't been tested by a lot of people, and if you would adopt it, you would be stuck with it forever. Do you actually want to adopt it?" Maybe you want to think twice about over commit to new technologies that hasn't been better tested.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):
I love your just broader advice is just simple like, to build successful AI apps, talk to users, build better data, write better prompts, optimize the user experience, versus just like, what is the latest and greatest? What's the best model to use right now? What's happening in AI? Let me follow this thread of this idea of fine-tuning and basically post-training. There's all these terms that people hear in AI, and I think this is going to be a really good opportunity for people to learn what we're actually talking about, since you actually do these things, you build these things, you work with companies doing these things. There's a few terms I want to sprinkle in through the conversation, but let's start with this one. What's the simplest way for someone to understand? What is the difference between pre-training and post-training and then just how fine-tuning fits into that, just what fine-tuning actually is?

Chip Huyen (00:07:34):
Chip disclaimer, I don't have full visibility on what this big secretive frontier labs are doing. But right from what I heard, so I think it's like one is, supervised fine-tuning when you have demonstration data, and you have a bunch of experts, "Okay, here's a prompt, and here is what the answer should be like." You just train it to emulate what the human expert could be like. That's also what a lot of people would like, so open-source models are doing as they do it by distillation. So instead of having human experts to write really great answers to prompts, they get very popular, famous good models to generate a response to it and getting this train smaller models to emulate.

(00:08:23):
Sometimes you see people just like... So, that's because I really appreciate open source community by the way, but going from being able to train models that can emulate a existing good model. It's very different from being [inaudible 00:08:38] trained good models, like an output for existing good model. So, it's a big step there. Yeah, we have my supervised fine-tuning, and another thing that's very big, I'm not sure you have guests talking about it already, but reinforcement learning is everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:52):
Let's pause on that because I definitely want to spend time on that, and that's such cool topic that's merging more and more in my conversations. But just to even summarize the things you just shared, which I think is really, really important stuff. So, the idea here is a model, essentially this algorithm piece of code that someone writes and say the frontier models are feeding it just like the entire internet of content, and basically, it's trying to test itself on predicting across all that data the next word, essentially. Token is the correct way of thinking about it, but a simpler way to think about it is the next word in text. As it gets it wrong, it adjusts these things called weights, essentially. Just like, is that a simple way to think about it, even that's just very surface level?

Chip Huyen (00:09:35):
So, I think of language modeling as a way of encoding statistical information about language, right? So, let's say that we both speak English, so we get a sense of what is more statistically likely. If I say my favorite color is, then you would say, "Okay, that should be another color." The word blue would be much more likely to appear than the word like [inaudible 00:09:59], right? Because statistically, blue is more likely to [inaudible 00:10:02] my favorite color is. So, it's a way of encoding statistical information.

(00:10:07):
So when language modeling, when you train a large amount of data, you see a lot of languages, a lot of domains. So it can tell, okay, your basic size is standard. Then the user do the prompts and it could come with the next most likely token. So by the way, it's not a new idea actually. So it's the idea comes very, very old, from the 1951 papers like English entropy. I think it's by Claude Shannon, it's a great paper. And I think it reveals a story I really like is from... Did you read Sherlock Holmes by the way?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:39):
Yeah, I read a few Sherlock Holmes books. Yeah.

Chip Huyen (00:10:41):
Yeah. So this is story of when Sherlock Holmes says using this statistical information to help solve a case. So this is his story. There is somebody left a message with a lot of stick figures. So Sherlock Holmes was like, okay, he knows that in English, the most common letter is E. Then the most common stick figure must be E. And then he goes, he stopped like that, [inaudible 00:11:07]. So the code... So I think there's language. So in a way, it's simple language modeling, but instead of at a work level, he does this as character level and token is something in between, right? A token is not quite a word, but it's bigger than a character. So let's say we say token because it would help us reduce vocabulary because which character is smallest amount of vocabulary right now. So alphabet has 26 character, but words can have millions and millions, right? Whereas tokens, you can be able to get the sweet spot between the two.

(00:11:44):
So let's say that we have the new word, how to say it, like podcasting, right? Let's say it's a new word, but it can divide a podcast and ing. So people understand, okay, podcast, we know the meaning. We know that ing is a verb, gerund, whatever it is. So we even know the word podcasting so that's why the token comes in. But yeah, the pre-tuning is basically encoding statistical informations of language to have you predict what is most likely. I think that most likely is the most simple way of doing it because it's more building a distribution of, okay, so the next token could be more 90% of the the time it could be a color, 10% of the time could be something else. So it basically distribution so language could pick, depending on your sampling strategy. Do you want it to always pick the most likely token or do you want it to pick something more creative? So I think my sampling strategy, I think is something extremely important. It can have you boost a performance in a huge way and very, very underrated.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
Okay, awesome. So essentially, a model is just code with this whole set of weights, essentially the statistical model that has learned to predict what comes next after certain words and phrases?

Chip Huyen (00:13:03):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
And then post-training and fine-tuning, specifically, is doing that same thing. So pre-training you get GPT5. Fine-tuning is someone taking GPT5 and doing the same sort of thing, adjusting these weights a little bit for specific use cases on data that they find is necessary to do their very specific use case. Is that a simple way to think about it?

Chip Huyen (00:13:24):
Yeah, I think weights is functions, right? So let's say you have... Maybe it has a functions of maybe Lenny's height is maybe 1X plus something or 2X [inaudible 00:13:38] and plus something is the weights, right? So you change it until you fit the correct data, which is my height and your height. So you can think it's a weight, as just a weight, say function. So you train, adjust the weights so they can fit the data, which is the training data.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:54):
Awesome. Okay. So we're talking about pre-training, post-training, fine-tuning. Is there anything else here that's important to share about just what this is exactly? What people need to understand about these parts of training?

Chip Huyen (00:14:06):
So the vast majority of time, we don't touch on pre-training model. As users, we don't use it at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:12):
Right. It's already done for us.

Chip Huyen (00:14:13):
Yeah. So I think my [inaudible 00:14:15] is a bit of fun process when my friend's training model is they try to play with their pre-training model and they're horrendous. They're saying things like [inaudible 00:14:23] "Oh, my gosh." Yeah, it's crazy. So it's very interesting to look at how much of post-training can change the model behavior and I think that's where a lot of time, is a lot of people are spending energy on nowadays, their frontier lab, is on post-training. Because pre-training, I think... So pre-training have been used to increase the general capacity of capabilities of a model. And it needs a lot of data and model size to increase the model capabilities. And at some point, we are actually have kind of maxed out on the internet data. And people text data max out. I think a lot of people are doing with other data like audios and videos, and everyone's trying to think of what is the new source of data, but where like post-trading, but middle course of this is more of everyone have very similar pre-training data, is that post-training is where they make a big difference nowadays.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:21):
This is a good segue to, you talked about supervised learning versus unsupervised learning. I love, we're getting into this, by the way. This is super interesting. So you talk about labeled data. Basically, supervised learning is AI learning on data that somebody has already labeled and told it, here's correct versus incorrect. For example, this is spam versus not spam. This is a good short story. This is not a good short story. We've had the CEOs of a lot of these companies that do this for labs, Mercor and Scale, Handshake, there's Micro, there's a few others. So is that essentially what these companies are doing for labs, giving them labeled data, high-quality data to train on?

Chip Huyen (00:15:57):
It is in a way, but I think it's more like a product of big equations. So there are a lot more different components than that. So that's why I was talking about reinforcement learning. I'm not sure if your CEO [inaudible 00:16:09] interview bring up that term. So the idea is that once you [inaudible 00:16:14]... So let's say you have a model, give the model a prompt and it produce an output. You want to buy, once you reinforce, encourage the model to produce an output that is better. So now it comes to how do we know that the answer is good or bad? So usually, people relies on signals. So one way to get a first one good or bad is human feedback. They happen to be have two responses. You can, okay, this one one's better than the other. And we do that is because as humans, we tend to, it's very hard to give a concrete score, but it's easier to do comparisons.

(00:16:53):
If you ask me, okay, give this song a score, I'm not a musician and don't know how hard it is. It's like yeah, I don't know what, out of 10 I going to remove six. And if you ask me again a month from now and I completely forgotten, okay, maybe now seven, only four, I don't know. But then if you ask me, okay, here are two songs and which one would you prefer to play for the birthday party? I was like, "Okay, I can prefer this song." So comparisons a lot easier. So [inaudible 00:17:18] have a human, you have human feedback and then you use this human feedback to treat a reward model to tell which and then the reward model help you like, okay, it's a model that produce this response.

(00:17:28):
It's [inaudible 00:17:30] can score, is this good or bad? And you try to bias toward producing better model, the better responses. Another ways you can, instead of using a human, so you can use AI because the response and say good or bad, right? Or in fact the thing is that people are very big on nowadays, verifiable rewards, which it's natural. So basically, they give it a math problem and then math solutions is a model app a solution. Okay, it's expected response should be 42 and if it doesn't provide 42, then it's wrong. Now it's not a good response. So yes, a lot of time, people using this human laborer, human laborers should produce, how to say, expert questions and I say expected answers and in the ways that [inaudible 00:18:16] systems that verifiable so that the models can be trained on. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:19):
Okay, I'm really glad you went there. This is essentially RLHF reinforcement learning with human feedback, which is exactly what I wanted to also talk about, right?

Chip Huyen (00:18:29):
Yeah. So I think it's general, it's a way of learning. It's training is [inaudible 00:18:33] learning and whether it learn from human feedback or AI feedback or verifiable rewards, I think I say it's just different way of collating signals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:44):
Awesome. Yeah. We had the CEO of Anthropic on the podcast and he talked about their version of RLHF, which is AI driven reinforcement learning. I love the way you phrased it where basically you want to help the model, you want to reinforce correct behavior and correct answers, and this is the method to do it, whether it's say an engineer seeing an output from a model being like, "No, here's how I would code it differently." And it's training a different model that the original model works with to tell it, am I correct or not correct? Is that right, roughly?

Chip Huyen (00:19:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:16):
Okay.

Chip Huyen (00:19:16):
I think that's a way of looking into it. I think that's a space is so exciting nowadays because there are so many domain expert task that the model developers want models to do well on, right? Let's say you're accountant. Maybe you want to use a model to have accounting task and need a lot of accounting data examples from accountant. So you need to hire a lot of them, should I do it or everyone [inaudible 00:19:41] physics problems, everyone should do, I don't know, legal questions and stuff or engineering questions or somebody was telling me they want to do, using coding to source scientific problems and not just coding to build product, which is another different whole realm of things. And I also using very specific toolings. I'm not sure what apps you use, but maybe like a [inaudible 00:20:04] app or QuickBooks or Google Excel. They have very specific tools, specific expertise. So you want the model [inaudible 00:20:13] learn.

(00:20:13):
So they need a lot of humans expert in this area should create data to train them and it's a massive thing people because everyone wants a lot of data and wants [inaudible 00:20:25] unlimited budget. But whether, I think this is also a little bit of low-key, interesting economics. I'm not sure you've talked to the guests about, I thought it's very interesting [inaudible 00:20:35] think about because it's very lopsided, right? Because they're only a very small numbers of frontier labs and they want a lot of data and there's a massive amount of startups or company providing related data. So you can see these companies like this startup doing data labeling. They have maybe some massive AR, but if you ask them, "Okay, so how many customers you have?" And they could be very small numbers, I'm not sure. I'm not sure you... I saw you smiling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:03):
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we chatted about that.

Chip Huyen (00:21:05):
Yeah, so I'm a little bit like [inaudible 00:21:08] uneasy. I have a company's growing crazy, but it's heavily dependent on two or three companies. And at the same time, if I was this company, frontier labs, what could be the right economical things for me to do? Now I want a lot of startups. I want to have a lot of providers so I can pick and choose, and as this providers can also to compete each other to lower the price and it's so dependent on [inaudible 00:21:34] regardless. So I feel like, yeah, so this whole economics is very interesting to me and I'm curious to see and how it plays out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):
What I'm hearing is you're bearish on the future of these data labeling companies because as you said, they don't have a lot of leverage over pricing because they have so few customers and there's so many people getting into the space. So basically, even though there's some of the fastest growing companies in the world, you're feeling like there's a challenge up ahead.

Chip Huyen (00:22:00):
I'm not sure if I'm bearish on it. I think I'm curious because I think things has a way of work out in ways that I don't expect. So I think that maybe these companies, they have a lot of data, maybe they wouldn't be able to use that to have some insight that helps them stay ahead of the curve. So I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
A very fair answer. Okay, while we're on this topic, I want to chat about evals, which is a very recurring topic in this podcast. This is the other piece of data content these companies share that AI labs really need. Can you just talk about what an eval is, the simplest way to understand it and then how this helps models get smarter?

Chip Huyen (00:22:41):
So I think people approach eval, I think they're two very different problems. One is a app builder and can I say have an app that do maybe a chatbot? Very simple answer first thing that came to my mind and I want you to know if chatbot is good or bad. So it needs to come away with evaluate the chatbot. Another thing is, I think of this as a task-specific eval design. So let's say I'm a model developer and I want to make my model better at code writing. And it was like, "Okay, but how do I even measure code writing?"

(00:23:19):
So I need someone to understand code writing and think about what makes a story good and then design the whole dataset and then criteria to evaluate code writing. So yeah, I think there's that. I think it's more like eval design that is very interesting [inaudible 00:23:39] work criteria, [inaudible 00:23:42] work guidelines, how to do it and then also train people how to do it effectively. So I guess, [inaudible 00:23:49], I think eval is really, really fun because it's extremely creative. I was looking at different eval people built and it was like, "Wow." It's not dry at all. It's just super, super, super fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:01):
We had a whole podcast on evals with Hamel and Shreya. That's exactly what they talked about is just, it's actually really fun to create evals for companies, especially. So let's still dig into that one a little bit more. There's this kind of debate online that, I don't know how big of a deal this debate is, but it feels like people spend a lot of time thinking about this, this idea of, do we need evals for AI products? Some of the best companies say they don't really do evals, they just go on vibes. They're just like, "Is this working well? Can I feel it or not?" What's your take on just the importance of building evals and the skill of evals for AI apps, not the model companies?

Chip Huyen (00:24:39):
You don't have to be absolutely perfect, I think, to win. You just need to be good enough and being consistent about it. Okay, this is not a philosophy I follow, but I have worked with enough companies to see that play out. So when I say, why a company don't eval? Let's say you are an executive and you want to have a new use case. So here's a use case you started out, built and it's like it works well. The customers are somewhat happy. You don't have the exact metric for it.

(00:25:05):
So the traffic keeps increasing, people seem happy, people keep buying stuff and now here's our engineer coming like, "Okay, we need eval for it." And it was like, "Okay, how much effort do we need to go into eval?" And they were like, "Okay, maybe two engineers, this much, this much." And it could maybe would improve that and it was like, "Okay, so how much expected gain can I get from it?" And the engineer would be like, "Oh, maybe you can improve it from 80% to 82%, 85%."

(00:25:33):
And it was like, "Okay, but [inaudible 00:25:35] that two engineers and we going to launch a new feature, then it could give me so much more improvement." So I think it's one of them is eval. Sometimes people think of eval as like okay, this is good enough, just don't touch it. If you do spend a lot of energy on eval, it would only incremental improvement where it spends the energy on another use case and maybe [inaudible 00:25:55] good enough that you can vibe check it.

(00:25:57):
So I do think maybe that's a debate is about. I do think that a lot of time people just get things to the place where it's like, okay, good enough, people run. But in the end, but of course there's a lot of risk associated with it because if you don't have a clear metric, you have a good visibility to [inaudible 00:26:17] applications or models performing it might do something very dumb or it can cause you, I know something crazy can happen. So yeah, so I do think eval is very, very important if you have, if you operate a scale and where failures can have catastrophic consequences.

(00:26:38):
Then you do need to be very tyrannical about what you put in front of the users, understand different failure modes, what could go wrong and also maybe in a space when that it's a feature, the product is a competitive advantage. You want to be the best at it. So you want to have a very strong understanding of where you are and where you are with the competitors. But it's just something that's more a low-key, okay, this is like something is like, okay, that's not the core but it helps with our users.

(00:27:04):
Then maybe you don't need to be so obsessed or theoretical about it. It's like, okay, that's good enough for now and if it fails, then it fails. Okay, I know it's so terrifying. But yeah, I think it's all about the question of return investment. I'm a big fan of eval, I love reading eval. And I says, I understand why some people would choose to not focus on eval right away and choose bringing on new functionalities instead.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):
Awesome. That is a really pragmatic answer. What I'm hearing is evals are great, very important, especially if you're operating at scale, but pick your battles. You don't need to write evals for every little feature. Something that Hamel and Shreya shared is that people need just, I don't know, five or seven evals for the most important elements of their product. Is that what you see or do you see a lot more in production that people build and need?

Chip Huyen (00:27:54):
I don't think of just a fixed number on the evals. What was the goal of eval? The goal of eval is to guide the product development. So you see eval, because I think I'm a big fan of eval, is that it helps you uncover opportunities where the progress are doing well. So sometimes, we've seen a very obvious [inaudible 00:28:15] where you look at the eval and we realize it's like, okay, it performed really poorly on this specific segment of users and then we look into it's like, okay, what's wrong with it? And it turns out, it's like we just don't have a good messaging to it. So people should just focus on the things that we're doing poorly, can improve significantly. Yeah, so I kind of like the number of eval is really depends. We have seen product with hundreds of different metrics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:40):
Oh, wow.

Chip Huyen (00:28:41):
People going crazy, this is because that product is general, have different names, have one eval for, I don't know, verbosity, have one eval for user sensitive data and another is for length but has a number of, okay, let's just give a good example, concrete example, like deep research. So you have the application, you have views and model to do deep research for you. Okay, have a prompt. Let me say, okay, do me a comprehensive research on only Lenny's Podcast and help me propose, show me report on what kind of topics he's interested in, what kind of videos could get the most views or what topics that he's missing on that he should be covering, right? Have that prompt. Then how do you evaluate the result? I don't think there's one metrics that would help. Maybe it's like maybe you have a hundred, I think somebody has a benchmark and is get a hundred expert, write a bunch of prompts and they go through, on the answers on AI and do it. And it's extremely costly and slow.

(00:29:46):
But [inaudible 00:29:47] might have something else. First of all, one way I was thinking about it, I was talking to a friend about it and one way it's like, how would you produce the result of the summary? At first you need to, what you do, gather informations and to gather informations you need to do a lot of search queries. You gather, grab the search results and then some of the search results you aggregate and then maybe say, okay, I'm still missing on this. You have to go another route and on another route, [inaudible 00:30:17] have the summary. So every step of the way, you need evaluations. You don't [inaudible 00:30:21] end-to-end. Maybe it was a search query in my first thing about, okay, now I write five search queries. I might look into how good are the search queries? Do they as they similar to each other because you need five search queries are very similar? Okay, Lenny Podcast, Lenny Podcast last month, Lenny Podcast two months ago.

(00:30:39):
It's not very exciting. But if the query is a podcast, the keywords are more diverse and then look at the results of the search query and then say you enter the search query. Lenny Podcast data labeling and they come up with 10 pages, 10 results. And then you come up with like, oh, Lenny Podcast on, I don't know, frontier labs, and you have 10 results. [inaudible 00:31:06] different webpages. Okay, how much of them overlapping... Are we doing both the breadth, getting a lot of page, but also, do we have depth and also do you have relevance because if we come up with a search query, it's completely irrelevant to the original prompt. So I feel like every aspect of it, it would need a way of evaluating. So I don't think it's how many eval should I get, but how many eval do I need to get a good coverage, a high confidence in my application's performance and also to help me understand where it is not performing well so that I can fix it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):
Awesome. And I'm hearing also just especially for the very core use case, the most common path people take in your product is where you want to focus.

Chip Huyen (00:31:51):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
Okay. There's one more term I want to cover and I want to go a somewhat different direction. RAG? People see this term a lot, R-A-G. What does it mean?

Chip Huyen (00:32:04):
So RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generations [inaudible 00:32:08] not a specific true generative AI. So the idea is just for a lot of questions, we need context to answer. So I think it came pretty, I think it's from the paper 2017. So someone was like, so they realized it's for a bunch of benchmark. When the question answering benchmarks, they realized it's like, okay, if we give the model informations about the questions, the next answer can be much, much better. So what they do with that is try to retrieve information from Wikipedia. So for question [inaudible 00:32:39], just retrieve that and then put it into the context and answer. It does much better. So I feel like it sounds like a no-brainer, right? I mean, obviously. So I think that's what RAG is, as a simplest sense, it's just providing the model with a relevant context so that it can answer the questions. And it's where things get really more interesting because traditionally, when it started out, RAG is mostly text.

(00:33:03):
So we talk about a lot of way of how to prepare data so that the model can retrieve effectively. Let's say that not everything is a Wikipedia page. A Wikipedia page is pretty contained and you know, okay, everything about it is about a topic. But a lot of time, you have documents of like [inaudible 00:33:19] and they have a weird way of structures of documents. Let's say that you had documents about Lenny Podcast and in the future, in the beginning a document it's like, from now on, podcast wouldn't refer to Lenny's Podcast. So let's say somebody in the future is like, "Okay, tell me about Lenny. Lenny's work." And because as a [inaudible 00:33:40] document does not have the term Lenny, you just don't know, you might not retrieve it. And if the document is long enough that it's chunked into a different part, so the second part doesn't have the word Lenny, so you cannot reach it. So you have to find a way to process data. So that makes sure it's like... It can retrieve, the information is just relevant to the query even though it might not immediately obvious that it's related.

(00:34:02):
So people come up with only thing of, I think, contextual visual, like giving X chunk of the data, the relevant, maybe in a summary metadata so that it knows or some people use as hypothetical questions. It's very interesting for even the chunk of documents, I must generate a bunch of questions that the chunks can help answer so that when I have a query, it's like okay, does it match any of the hypothetical questions? It can fetch it. So it's very interesting approach. Okay, so maybe before I go to the next thing, I just want to say this data preparations for RAG is extremely important. And I would say this in a lot of the companies that I have seen, that's the biggest performance, in their RAG solutions coming from better data preparations, not agonizing over what [inaudible 00:34:51] databases to use because [inaudible 00:34:53] database, of course is very important to care about things like latency or if you have very specific access patterns like read-heavy or write-heavy, of course, it's like it matters. But in term of pure quality answers, I think the data preparation is just [inaudible 00:35:07].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:06):
When you say data preparation, what's an example to make that real and concrete for us to understand?

Chip Huyen (00:35:16):
So one way is mentioned as in you have chunks of data. So we have think about how big of each chunk should be. Because if it's sort of think about it's a context you want to maximize, maybe you can, it's very simple example. You want to retrieve a thousand words. So if a data chunk is long, then it's more likely to contain more relevant metadata so it can retrieve more. But if it's too long then you have a thousand word. And so chunk is like a thousand words, you can reach one chunk. So it's not very useful. But if it's too short, then you can retrieve more relevant information also. It can retrieve a wider range of documents and chunks, but at the same time each chunk is too small to contain relevant information.

(00:36:02):
So we have very nice chunk design, how big each chunk should be. You add contextual informations like summary, metadata, hypothetical questions. Somebody was telling me just a very big performance they got is that from rewriting their data in the question-answering format. Instead of having... So they have a podcast instead of just chunking the podcast, you just reframe, rewrite it into here's a question, here's answers and produce a lot of them. It can use AI for that as well. So that's one example of data processing. A lot of example I see is for people helping, using AI to help specific [inaudible 00:36:40] use and documentations. And we write documentation. Usually a lot of documentation today is written for human reading and AI reading is different because it's different because humans, we have common sense and we kind of know what it is. So one things are, even for human experts, they have the context that AI doesn't quite have.

(00:36:59):
So somebody told me that what's a big change they have is let's say, that you have a function. The documentation for this, maybe the library. As a library said okay, the output of this one is maybe talking for, I don't know, some crazy term, maybe some temperature or something on the graph. It should be like one zero or minus one. And as a human expert maybe understand the scale, what one in the scale mean, but for AI, just really doesn't understand what that means. So actually, have another annotation layer for AI. It's like, okay, good temperatures equal one means like that. It's not like it's a actual temperature. It's associated with the scale over there. So just saving all this data processing to make it easier for AI to retrieve the relevant information to answer the questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:45):
This episode is brought to you by Persona, the verified identity platform, helping organizations onboard users fight fraud and build trust. We talk a lot on this podcast about the amazing advances in AI, but this can be a double-edged sword.

(00:38:51):
Awesome. Okay. So you've talked a bit about how you work with companies on these sorts of things, on their AI strategies, on their AI products, how they build, which tools they build, all these things. I want to spend a little time here because a lot of companies are building AI products. A lot of companies are not having a good time building AI products. Let me ask a few questions along these lines of what you've learned working with companies that are doing this well. One is just, I guess, in terms of AI tool adoption and adoption in general within companies, there's all this talk recently of just all this AI hype. The data is actually showing most companies try it. Doesn't do a lot, they stop. And so there's all this just maybe this isn't going anywhere. So in terms of just adoption of tools in AI within companies, what are you seeing there?

Chip Huyen (00:39:32):
For GenAI in company, I think there are two types of GenAI toolings that have been, I've seen ones is to internal productivity, like have coding tools, Slack chatbot, internal knowledge. A lot of big enterprises have some a wrapper around models, so with access to maybe some different type of a RAG solution. I think we talk about data or kind of like text-based RAG. We haven't talked about agentic RAG or I haven't talked about multi-modal RAG yet. But this, yes, it's a whole very exciting area around that. So basically, it should allow the employee to access internal document. Somebody ask, okay, I'm having a baby. What could be the maternal or paternal policy or am I having these operations with the health benefit cover that or I want you to interview, I want to refer my friend. What will be the process for that? So a lot of this having chatbot, internal chatbot to help with internal operations.

(00:40:35):
And another things, another category is more customer facing or partner facing. So product customers support chatbot is a big one. If you're a hotel chain, you might have a booking chatbot, which is somehow massive. A lot of booking chatbot because I guess it's... I do have this theory of a lot of applications companies pursue because they can't measure the concrete outcome. And I feel like booking or a sales chatbot, it's very clear. There was a conversion rate right now with that chatbot with human operators and what could be conversion rate with a chatbot and certain, somehow I think it's very clear outcomes and companies are easier to buy into these solutions. So a lot of companies have that customer facing chatbot.

(00:41:20):
So that is another category of tool and I think that for customers or external facing tools, because people are driven to choose applications with clear outcomes. So the questions of adopting them is really based on whether they see the outcome or not. Of course, it's not perfect because sometimes the outcome can be bad not because the idea or the application's idea [inaudible 00:41:52] is bad. It's just because the process of building it is not that great. Yeah. So it's tricky. For the internal adoptions of toolings or internal productivities, that's where it gets tricky. I would say a lot of companies [inaudible 00:42:08] think of AI strategy. I think of AI strategies usually have two key aspects. It's like use cases and the second is talent. You might have great data for great use cases, but you don't have talents and you cannot do it.

(00:42:23):
So a lot of time at the beginning with GenAI and sometimes I'm really admire a lot of companies for that, it's just like [inaudible 00:42:28] was like, okay, we need our employees to be very GenAI aware, very AI literate. So what I do is I start maybe adopting a bunch of tools for the team to use. They have a lot of up-skilling workshops, they encourage learning and then it's a really, really good thing. And it's also willing to spend a lot of money into adopting, giving people chargeability, subscriptions, purchase subscriptions, [inaudible 00:42:56] subscriptions to get the employees to be more AI literate. And that's the thing is a lot of... There's a [inaudible 00:43:05] may say, okay, we spend a ton of money on this tooling, but then we don't see because you can see the usage, but people don't seem to use them as much and what is the issue. So yeah, so I think that is tricky. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):
What do you think is the issue? Is it just they don't know how to use them? What do you think is the gap here? Do you think we'll get to a place of just like, wow, work is completely different because of AI for a lot of companies?

Chip Huyen (00:43:32):
The main thing is it's really hard to measure productivity again. So I talk to a lot of people on their website. First of all, [inaudible 00:43:40] is coding. A lot of companies not using coding agents or coding [inaudible 00:43:45] coding. And I was asking, I was like, "Do you think that it helps with your productivity?" And a lot of times, the questions are very [inaudible 00:43:56] okay, I feel like it's [inaudible 00:43:59] better. And I said, okay, because we have more PRs, we see more code and then immediate [inaudible 00:44:04]. Okay, but of course, code, number of live code is not a good metric for that. So it's really, really tricky and it's something funny. So I do ask people to ask their managers because I work with usually VP level, so they have multiple teams under them. So I asked them, okay, do you ask some managers, okay, would you rather have access...

(00:44:28):
Would you rather give everyone on the team very expensive coding agent subscriptions or you get an extra headcount? Let's say maybe and almost everyone could say the managers could say headcount. But if you ask VP level or someone who manage a lot of teams, they would say just like [inaudible 00:44:48] good one, AI, a system as tools. And the reason is that we could say okay, because as manager is right, because you are still growing. You're not as a level when you manage hundreds of thousands of people. So for you, having one HR headcount is big. So you want that not for productivity reasons, but because you just want to have more people working for you. Whereas for executives, you care more about, maybe you have more business metrics that you care about. So you actually think about what actually drive productivity metrics for you. So it is tricky and I think that the question of productivity. I'm not sure it's fundamentally is the [inaudible 00:45:32] more productive, but it's just like we don't have a good way of measuring productivity improvement.

(00:45:37):
Another thing is also very [inaudible 00:45:40]. And I think it's like people do tell me that they notice different buckets of employees, different reactions to AI assist tools. First of all, I keep going back to coding because coding is big and it's easier to reason somehow. So it says I have different reports. One team would tell me that... One of people tell me, okay, amongst on his engineers, he thinks senior engineers would get the most output, would be more productive because it's like, okay, so that person's very interesting. So he actually divided his team to three buckets, but he didn't tell them, obviously. He was like, okay, here's more currently best performing, average performing and lowest performing. And then there's a randomized trial. So they give half of each group access to Cursor. And then [inaudible 00:46:31] noticed over time it was like, okay, something funny. The group that get the biggest performance boost, in his opinion, he was very close to his team.

(00:46:39):
The biggest performance boost [inaudible 00:46:41] the senior engineer, the highest performing. So the highest performing engineer get the biggest boost out of it. And then the second group is the average performing. So his opinion is like, okay, the highest performing engineers is also normal practice. They also know how to solve problems. So they have some solved problem better. Whereas the people who have the lowest performing, they only don't care much about work. So it's easier to just go on autopilot, get it to generate that code and just do it or just don't know how to do it. Another company, however, they tell me just actually, senior engineers are the one most resistant to using AI as this tooling because they said it's like, okay, but AI, because they are more opinionated and they have very high standard. It was like, okay, but AI code, [inaudible 00:47:30] code just sucks. So just very, very resistant in using it. So I don't know, I haven't quite been able to reconcile very different reports on that yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):
This is so interesting. So just to make sure I'm hearing what the story, so there's a company you work with, that did a three bucket test with their engineering team where they created three sorts of groups, the highest performing engineers, mid-performing engineers, lowest performing engineers, and gave some of them, so they gave some of them access to say, Cursor. Was it Cursor or what did they give them access to? It was Cursor, right?

Chip Huyen (00:48:03):
I think it was Cursor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Okay, cool. And so within-

Chip Huyen (00:48:05):
I didn't work with them. This is more like a friend company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:08):
Okay. It's a friend's company.

Chip Huyen (00:48:09):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
So did they give half of the higher performing engineers Cursor and half not or how did they do the split there?

Chip Huyen (00:48:14):
Yeah, so they give half of the entire company but half of each bucket. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:18):
Whoa.

Chip Huyen (00:48:19):
And then they observe the difference in productivity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):
I see. So how do they even do that? They're just like, "Okay, you get cursor, you don't get cursor." How did they do that? That's so interesting.

Chip Huyen (00:48:31):
Yeah, I didn't get into the mechanics of it, but I was like, "I respect you for doing a randomized trial on that."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:33):
That is so cool.

Chip Huyen (00:48:33):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:34):
Okay. Wow. How large was this engineering team? Was it like hundreds of people?

Chip Huyen (00:48:38):
It's not that large. It's about maybe 30 to maybe 40. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):
30 to 40. Okay.

Chip Huyen (00:48:44):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:44):
Wow. Okay. So they found that the highest performing engineers had the most benefit from using AI tools and then behind them was the middle tier engineers and the worst performers or the lowest performers. Okay.

Chip Huyen (00:48:59):
But it's also not the same everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:59):
Right. Right. Right, right.

Chip Huyen (00:48:59):
Some companies are different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:03):
Right. This other example you shared of just senior engineers in this one example are most resistant to changing the way they work, which I get. I do feel like the most valuable people right now other than ML researchers and AI researchers like yourself, are senior engineers because it feels like junior engineers are just, so much of this is now done by AI, but an engineer that knows what they're doing that understands how things work at a large scale with AI tools, just basically infinite junior engineers doing their bidding, feels like an extremely valuable and powerful asset.

Chip Huyen (00:49:39):
Yeah, I definitely really appreciate, as you see companies, we appreciate engineers who have a good understanding of the whole systems and be able to have good problem solving skill are thinking holistically instead of locally. Or when our company have seen the way they work, as they told me is we're completely different now. So they actually restructured engineering org so that they get more senior engineers should be more in the peer review because they get writing guidelines on what is a good engineering practices, what is the process would be like.

(00:50:12):
Or maybe like okay, so they write a lot of processes on how to work well. And then they have more junior engineers just produce code and submit PR, but senior engineer more in the reviewing case. So I think it might be prepared for the future. So another company actually told me something very similar. So preparing for the future once they only need a very small group of very, very strong engineers to create processes and reviewing code to get into production but get AI or junior engineers to produce code. But then the question becomes just like, how does one become a very strong senior engineer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:54):
Right. That's right. That's right. That's the problem. Yeah.

Chip Huyen (00:50:57):
Yeah. So I don't know what's the process I was thinking about, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):
No one's thinking about it. It's a problem. We won't have any more in 10, 20 years. There'll be no more engineers because no one's hiring junior engineers. Although I could make the case. Junior engineers, people just getting into computer science right now, are just AI native. And in theory, you could argue they will become really good really fast if they're curious, aren't just delegating, learning and thinking to AI, but learning how to actually, using it to learn how to code well and architect correctly. You could argue they'll be the most successful engineers in the future.

Chip Huyen (00:51:33):
I do think that what I mentioned said relating to architect. I think I grouped that in my system thinking. I do think it's very important skill because I think AI can help automate a lot of disjointed skills, but knowing how to utilize the skills together to solve problems is hard. So that's a webinar between Mehran Sahami who is one my favorite professors. He was a chair of the curriculum at the CS Department at Stanford. So he spent a lot of time thinking about CS educations, what should students learn nowadays in the area of AI coding. And then the other person is Andrew Ng, which is of course, is a legend in the AI space. And Mehran Sahami, Professor Sahami, said something very interesting. He said a lot of people think that CS is about coding, but it's not. Coding is just a means to an end.

(00:52:27):
CS is about system thinking, using coding to solve actual problem and problem solving will never go away because what AI can automate more stuff. The problem is just get bigger. But as a process of understanding what caused the issue and how to design step-by-step solution to it, will always be there. So I think an example of, I actually have a lot of issues with AI for in the way of it's debugging. So I'm not sure you use a lot of AI for coding, but something I have noticed and also seen from my friends, it's like it is pretty good when you have very clear, well-defined tasks. Maybe write documentations, fix specific features or build an app from scratch. Doesn't have to interact with a large access in code base, but you added something a little bit more complicated, maybe required interaction with other components and stuff. It's usually not that good.

(00:53:21):
And for example, I was using AI to deploy an applications and it was testing out a new hosting service I was not familiar with. It was like, okay. Usually they inform me, so working AI does give me is confidence to try a new tool. Before what AI is like trying new tools has written, not documentations for the beginning, but I was like, okay, just try it out and learn. So I was testing out this new hosting service and it kept getting a bug, so was very, very annoying. And it was like, okay, I asked [inaudible 00:53:51], fix it. And it kept changing the way, maybe change the environment variable, fix the code, maybe not change from the function to this function, maybe change the language, maybe it doesn't process JavaScript, I don't know, whatever. And it didn't work. And it was like, okay, that's it.

(00:54:07):
I'm just going to read documentation myself and see what's wrong. And it turns out, it's like I'm on another tier, the [inaudible 00:54:16] I want did not, is not available in this tier, right? So I feel like, okay, so the issue with [inaudible 00:54:22] was just trying to focus on fixing things from a different component versus the issue is from a different component. So I think of, okay, be understanding how different components work together and where the source of issue might come from. You need to give a holistic view of it. And it's made think is like, okay, how do we teach AI system thinking that I have all the human experts having very much [inaudible 00:54:46] scaffold just like, okay, for this kind of problem, look into this, look into that, look into that, and then stuff. So [inaudible 00:54:53] that could be one way, but that's also made me think is, how do we teach humans, system thinking? Yeah. So yeah, I think it's very interesting skill. I do think it's very important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):
That's exactly the same insight Bret Taylor shared on the podcast. He's the co-founder of Sierra. He created Google Maps. He was CEO of Salesforce, Quip, a few other things. And I asked him just like, should people learn to code? And his point is exactly what you said, which is taking computer science classes is not about learning Java and Python. It's learning how systems work and how code operates and how software works broadly, not just, here's a function to do a thing.

(00:55:32):
One thing that I wanted to help people understand, you wrote this book called AI Engineering, which is essentially helping people understand this new genre of engineer and you have this really simple way of thinking about the difference between an ML engineer and an AI engineer, which has a really good corollary to product managers now, of just an AI product manager versus a non-AI product manager. The way you describe it and fill in what I'm missing is just ML engineers built models themselves. AI engineers use existing models to build products. Anything you want to add there?

Chip Huyen (00:56:05):
One thing I really dislike about writing books is that it has to define this and I think it's like no definitions would be perfect because they always be edge cases. But yeah, in general, I think it's just like GenAI as a service, more as a service, when somebody build the models for you and the base model performance is a pretty [inaudible 00:56:26]. So it's like it's enabled people to just like, okay, now I want to integrate AI into my product. I don't need to learn [inaudible 00:56:34] even though knowing that could really help. But yeah, it makes an entry barrier really low for people who want to use AI to build product and at the same time, AI capabilities are so strong. It's also increased the possibilities, the type applications that AI can be used for. So I think yes, both entry barriers' is super low and a demand for AI applications a lot bigger. So it feels, it's very, very exciting. It's opens up a whole new ball of possibilities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:04):
Yeah. It's like now you don't have the time, now you don't have to spend time building this AI brain. Now you can just use it to do stuff, such an unlock. Okay. Maybe just a final question. You get to see a lot of what's working, what's not working, where things are heading. I'm curious just if you had to think about in the next two or three years, just where things are heading, how do you think building products will be different? How do you think companies working will be different if you had to think of maybe the biggest change we expect to see in the next few years, in terms of how companies work?

Chip Huyen (00:57:40):
I think in a lot of organizations they don't move that fast, but at the same time, they move faster than I expected because again, I think it's like bias and don't work with dinosaur companies who don't care. I think a lot of executives who come to me are very forward-looking. So maybe for me, I'm very biased towards organizations is move fast. So yeah, I think one big change I see just in organizational structure. I think this a lot of value plays in... So before we have a lot of disjointed teams. We have very clear engineering team, product team, but then there's a question of who should write eval? Who should own the metrics? And it turns out, eval, it's not a separate problem. It's a system problem because you need to look into different components, how they interact with each other. You need user behaviors because you need to know what users care about so that you can write eval reflect what users care about.

(00:58:44):
So all of that you can sort it from you look into different component architectures, place guardrails and stuff. So it's just engineering, but understanding users is what product. So because of a lot of things and eval is extremely important. So the kind of bring product team and engineering team, even marketing team like user acquisition, very close to each other. So yes, since in a ways if people are structuring, so that's more communications between previously very distinct functions. Another thing is I also see as teams, of course, I think about what can be automated in the next few years and what work cannot be automated. And I seen that people already shedding, actually it's a little bit scary to think about it, but I also think it's the teams, they would've told me, it's just like okay, this is good and you and me, but we have got rid of these functions for a lot of things like previously outsourced, for example.

(00:59:37):
Traditionally, it's a business outsourcing that's not core to them and can be in a more systematized. So with that, you can actually use AI to automate a lot of that. And so as a separation people thinking more of what is the value of junior engineers or senior engineers, how should we restructure engineering org for that? Yeah, so I do definitely think that is one thing to successful organization. People are just moving pieces around and thinking about use cases, whether you need to spin out new use cases and who would lead a new effort. That is one big change. Another thing in terms of AI, I think there's, I'm not sure how true this is. I guess, I'm also on the camp of thinking that it has merit, is a camp of okay, base models we have probably not quite maxed out, but we're unlikely to see really, really strong, crazily strong model.

(01:00:44):
So you remember when we have GPT, right? And then GPT2, which is a big step up, an [inaudible 01:00:49] better than GPT and then GPT3, which much, much bigger than GPT4, much, much bigger. And then of course, GPT5, but it's GPT5, that scale of much bigger step jump compared to the previous, I think it's debatable. So I think that we had disappointment, the base model performance improvement is not going to be mind-blowing. It was in the last three years. So I think there's a lot of improvements when I see in the post-training phase, in the application building phase. And yes, also I think that's where I feel I would see a lot of improvement there. I also very interest in multimodality. So we've seen a lot of text base, but I think there's a lot of audio, videos use cases that is very, very exciting.

(01:01:45):
And I think audios is not quite as solved. Well, I think because I do work with a couple of voice startups and when it comes to, think about voice, it's an entirely different beast. So let's say have chatbot. We go from a text chatbot to voice chatbot. It's like the consoles are completely different because now with voice chatbot, we need to think about latency because I think multiple steps, first have voice to text, text to text, text question into text answer and then text to voice answer. So you have multiple hops and latency become very important. And there's a question, what does it make you sound natural? So for example, people think of in AI and humans, when humans talk to each other, if I say, you try to interrupt me and say, Chip [inaudible 01:02:36]. I would pause and I try to hear you out.

(01:02:38):
But sometime even if I just like say some word, like acknowledge when I, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that I shouldn't stop. It's just continue. So the question of forced interruption and whether it's, should I stop or not, it's a big in what perceived as natural conversations. And that's also regulations because a lot of time, people want to build AI chatbot, voice chatbots that sound like humans, try to trick users into thinking that they're talking to humans, but also maybe potential regulation saying okay, you have to disclose to users when you talk, if the bot is talking to is human or AI. So I think this a whole space, I think it's not quite as solved as you think. But it's not quite like an AI foundation model problem because a human interruption detection, it's actually a classical machining problem.

(01:03:32):
It's a different framing, but you can give classifier for that. Or the question of latency, actually a massive engineering challenge, not an AI challenge. Of course, it can be an AI challenge because people are trying to build voice-to-voice model. So instead of having to firstly transcribe the voice from me into text and then get a model [inaudible 01:03:54] text answer and get another model should turn from text to speech, you can just do voice-to-voice directly. So that is something we're working on, but it's very hard. Yeah. So yeah, so even audio, I think of it's the easier than video because video have both image and voice. It's already pretty hard. So I think there's a lot of challenges in that space.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:16):
That was an awesome list of things. Let me mirror them back real quick. So what you're predicting in the next few years, things that will change in the way we work, and these actually resonate with so many conversations I've had on this podcast. So says, just kind of doubling down on where things are heading. One is the blurring of lines between different functions instead of just design engineering. Everyone's going to be doing a lot of different things now. Two is, just more of work being automated with agents and all these AI tools and just in theory, productivity going up. Third is, a shifting from pre-training models to post-training, fine-tuning and things like that because to your point, models maybe are slowing down in how smart they're getting.

(01:04:57):
Although, I'll point folks to the, I had a chat with the co-founder of Anthropic. He made a really good point here. He's like, we're really bad at understanding what exponentials feel like when we're in the middle of that. And also, models are being released more often. So the difference between them we may not notice because they're just happening more often versus GPT3 came out a year before after GPT2. Maybe true, maybe not. And then the fourth point you made is this idea of multimodal, investing in multimodal experiences. I cannot wait for ChatGPT voice mode to get better at interruption, exactly what you're saying. I'm just talking to it and then someone makes a little sound and it's like [inaudible 01:05:33]. Okay. And then you have to, and then it's like, and then it stops talking. It's so annoying.

Chip Huyen (01:05:36):
I'm shocked that we don't have better voice assistant at home yet. I think I have been testing out a bunch, honestly. I keep hoping, oh my God, that could be the one and then I know how many of them I just had to give away because they're not that good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:49):
I think it's coming. I hear it's coming. Anthropic's working with someone that, I don't know if it's launched or not yet.

Chip Huyen (01:05:54):
Yeah, [inaudible 01:05:55] want to bring back to what you mentioned about your guest from Anthropic, mentioned about the performance improvement. I think there's a big change, I think this difference between a model-based capability. So I'm talking about the pre-trained model versus the perceived performance perform. So let's say, I'm not sure you thought about, are you familiar with the term test time compute?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:20):
I don't think so. Help us understand.

Chip Huyen (01:06:26):
So this idea is like okay, you have a fixed amount of compute. So you're going to spend a lot of compute on pre-training or training the model. Pre-training and then I've spent a lot of some compute fine-tuning and the ratio of pre-training to the post-training compute is crazy, varies between different lab. And also, since then has a spend compute on generate inference. When I have a trends and fine-tuning model and now you want to serve it to users. So I might type a question in a prompt and if generate, do inference and that requires a compute. And I guess, I feel about discussion of should I spend more compute on pre-training or fine-training or inference because inference and people thought I was just like test time compute. So spending more compute on inference is like calling test time compute as a strategy of just allocating more resources, compute resource to generate inference when I shouldn't bring better performance and how does that do it?

(01:07:22):
Let's say you have a math questions and maybe instead of just generate one answer again generate four different answers and say okay, whichever is the best according to some standard or okay, I have four answers and then maybe three of them say 42 and one of them says 20. You say okay, three of them in agreement. So the answer should be 42. So just people shouldn't generate a bunch of it. Or another thing is a lot of time like reasoning, thinking, it just be able to generate more thinking tokens, like spend more time thinking before showing the final answers. It's like require more compute but also give more better performance. So yeah, so I think it's like from the ease of perspective when the model spend more time exploring different potential answers, thinking longer, it can give you much better final answers. But the base model itself does not change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
Awesome.

Chip Huyen (01:08:17):
Does it make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
Yes, that does. Absolutely.

Chip Huyen (01:08:18):
Yeah?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:19):
That is a good corollary to Ben Man's point.

Chip Huyen (01:08:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):
Chip, we covered a lot of ground. I've gone through everything I was hoping to learn and more. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?

Chip Huyen (01:08:34):
So I do work with a few companies that does these things of they want employees to come up with ideas. So there's a big debate on what is a better way for AI strategy, should they be top out or bottom up, should executives come up with one or two killer use case and everyone allocate resource to that, should you give engineers and PMs and smart people come up with ideas. And I think it's a mixture of both. So some companies it was like, okay, we hire a bunch of smart people, let's see what they come up with and they organize more hackathons or internal challenge to get people to build product. And one thing that I noticed, a lot of people just don't know what you built. And it shocked me why I feel like we are in some kind of an idea crisis, right?

(01:09:21):
Now, we have all this really cool tools to have. You do everything from scratch, can have you design, it can have you write code, it can build website. So in theory, we should see a lot more, but at the same time, people are somehow stuck. They don't know what to build. And I think it's like, maybe you see a lot of had to do with maybe society expectations because we have gone into this phase of specializations, people very highly specialized and people are supposed to focus on one thing really well instead of being a big picture. And we don't have a big picture view. It's hard to come up with ideas of what you build.

(01:09:58):
So I know what, when I work with this company on this hackathon, we do work on come up with a guideline, how to come up with ideas. And usually what we think of is like, okay, one tip is go look from the last week. For a week, just pay attention to what you do and what frustrates you. And when something frustrates you, think about, is there anything we can do? Can it be done a different way? So it's not frustrating and you can talk, people can swap to accept [inaudible 01:10:27] or teams, and I even see they come on frustrations. Maybe there's something you can think about just to build something around that. So yeah, so I feel like just notice how we work, thinking of ways, constantly ask questions, how can this be better? And then I just build something to address the frustrations, I think it's a good way to learn and adopt AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):
I think people have felt exactly what you're describing every time they open up one of these vibe coding tools where you could just describe anything you want. I'm like, "I don't know, what do I want?" And I love this very tactical piece of advice, just like what frustrates you, just pay attention to where you're frustrated. For example, I just built a very cool little vibe coded app. I was working on a newsletter post inside Google Docs and I pasted all these images into the Google Doc, from screenshots and stuff and then I forgot, oh yeah, you can't take images out of Google Docs. It's like this Hotel of California experience where you can paste stuff into it, very hard to get images back out. So I just went to all the vibe coded tools and just built an app that I can give you a Google Doc URL and it let me download all the images automatically. And it worked amazingly well and I made it really cute. And I'll link to it in the show notes.

Chip Huyen (01:11:33):
OH, I would love to see that. I'm very bullish on using AI, just create micro tools. It's just something just make your life a bit easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:41):
A hundred percent. I feel like that's one of the main ways people are using these tools, just a little niche problem they have. With that, Chip, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Chip Huyen (01:11:54):
Yeah, always. No, no, no. It depends on how hard the questions are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:58):
They're very consistent across every guest. So I imagine you've heard them before. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Chip Huyen (01:12:10):
I'm really terrified of book recommendations because I feel like what books [inaudible 01:12:15] you should read really depends on what they want and where they're in life and where they want to get to. But just several books that I do think's have really changed the way I think and see the world. So one thing is The Selfish Gene, that's to understand, it actually helped me with the question whether I want to have kids or not because it's understanding more of a lot of our functions, the way we operate is the functions of our genes and genes want to do one thing, to procreate.

(01:12:46):
So yes, in a way, the book also proposed another thing is so everyone wants to live forever and maybe it's not consciously, but subconsciously, we do want that. And there are two ways. One is via genes. Genes [inaudible 01:13:00] want to continue forever, but [inaudible 01:13:03] two ideas. I think there's something [inaudible 01:13:05]. It's just like being able, if you have some ideas out there and then it's last for a long time, it's going to live on. I know it's a little bit abstract, but I thought it's very interesting.

(01:13:16):
The other books I really, really like is from the book from Singaporean previous, I think he is [inaudible 01:13:24] as a Father of Singapore, I don't know, Lee Kuan Yew. I'm not sure what's the title is, but he was the one who led Singapore from, he's changed Singapore from a Third World country to a first world country within 25 years. And I have never seen any country leaders spent so much effort into putting down his thought of how to build a country like that.

(01:13:47):
And as I talk a lot about public policy, how to create policies that encourage people to do the right things that is good for the nations and also talking about foreign affairs, foreign policies, the liberation of the country, but other. So it's a really good book to think about. For me, it's a system thinking, but it's a different kind of system which a country, which a lot of us don't get a chance to ever experiment in our life. So it's good to learn about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):
What was the name of that second book?

Chip Huyen (01:14:15):
It's called From Third to First World. Actually, I think I have it somewhere here. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:20):
There it is.

Chip Huyen (01:14:21):
It's a very heavy book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:21):
Show and tell.

Chip Huyen (01:14:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):
That's awesome. I definitely want to read that. That's a really good [inaudible 01:14:26]. I've heard a lot about just the impact he's had and I've seen all these videos on Twitter of just his really wise insights into how to build a thriving society. And clearly, it works.

Chip Huyen (01:14:34):
Yeah. Can you believe, how does he time to write such a thick book? It's insane.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:39):
That is. Claude, please summarize. I'm just joking. By the way, Selfish Gene, I also absolutely love that book. That is such a good choice. It's such an under the radar kind of book that really changed the way I see the world as well. So really good pick. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Chip Huyen (01:14:56):
So I watched a lot of movie and TV shows as a research because I working on my first novel and I recently sold it. So I'm interested what makes, it's a drama. It's not a science fiction or anything that tech people usually read. So it very, I know it's a very out of left field and very, so it's almost like reading, watching TV to see what kind of stories become popular, trying to understand the trope and stuff like that. So I'm not sure if the audience will like...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):
Well, what's one? What's one that taught you something about writing?

Chip Huyen (01:15:35):
I think like Yanxi Palace. It's a Chinese TV show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:37):
Cool. Okay. I haven't heard that one on the podcast before. Okay, cool.

Chip Huyen (01:15:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:43):
Next question. Do you have a life motto that you often think about, come back to when you're dealing with something hard, whether it's in work or in life?

Chip Huyen (01:15:51):
This sounds very nihilist. I think to say, in the end, nothing really matters. Usually, I think of in the grand scheme of things, in a billion years, nothing will, no one would ever be there. I think okay, someone will argue with me about that. [inaudible 01:16:05]. So my theory's like, in a billion years, none of us would ever exist. So whatever messy things, like crazy things we do or how bad we do it, I mean, no one would be remember, wouldn't be there to remember it. And I think in a way, it sounds scary, but it's very liberating because it just allows me say, okay, let's just try things out, right? Why does it matter? And there's a story of recently, so I have some family member who passed away recently. And I was talking to my dad because I couldn't be home for that.

(01:16:36):
I was asking my dad like, "Okay, os there anything I can do to make the person..." Something like comfort. So anything that you can get the persons. And my dad was just like, "What can he possibly want at this moment?" It just made me feel at the end of life, there's nothing that can bring you, like material can bring you joy. There's no money, no product, nothing. And in way, it makes me feel like, okay, what really do I really care about at the end of the day? So I guess it's like I think about it. It's just like, okay, maybe I fail it, maybe I don't get that contract. Maybe those things, but in the end of life, I don't think that actually really matters. So in a way, it's quite liberating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):
I know you said it might be nihilistic. This is what Steve Jobs shared too in one of his most famous speeches. Just we all die someday day, so don't take things so seriously and it is freeing. Absolutely. It just makes you appreciate every moment, every day you have. Just like, yeah, let's just do something hard and scary. Okay, final question. You talked about how you're writing a novel. Most people in tech have never written something creative and fiction. What's just one thing you learned in the process about how to write better stories, better fiction?

Chip Huyen (01:17:46):
A lot of time when we read, we get tripped up by some small things. So I think I want to do creative writing because I just want to go a better writer and it tells us maybe try a different audience could have me become better at anticipating what this different type of audience would want to hear and what they care about. So it's a way for me to get a... So I think if I write it or even any kind of content creations is about predicting the user's reactions, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:14):
The next token.

Chip Huyen (01:18:15):
You do a podcast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
Just kidding.

Chip Huyen (01:18:17):
Yeah. Yeah, so you do a podcast, it's like, okay, what kind things that the users could find engaging, right? And I find this a little bit and a lot of companies you have launch a product, you have a narrative coming out and say, okay, how do we position this product in a way that users would want? So I feel like I have done technical writing for a while and I felt like I had some experience trying to predict what engineers would want to hear or care about. But then I don't have any experience like this, completely different type of audience. So that's what I want to, creative writing, writing a story. And that's why I was doing a lot of research [inaudible 01:18:55]. I mean, doing research [inaudible 01:18:56] enjoyed a lot, watching a lot of dramas. I just see what people like. So one thing that I care about is, I think I learned what emotional journey was from a editor.

(01:19:05):
So when we write something we care about how users would feel across a story. We want something in the beginning, we want something, we need to have a hook so that people continue reading. But we also don't want too much of drama because we'll get too tired because you're emotionally exhausted because it's like you're being emotionally manipulated a lot of time. So it gave a emotional journey, maybe have some climax or something more chill, maybe like... And also care about another thing I didn't realize is, for me, for technical writing, you entirely focus on the content, the argument. It's very impersonal. For example, people like ML compilers, doesn't matter if they like the person telling them about compiler or not because it's just objective [inaudible 01:19:56]. But for a novel, people care about character likeability.

(01:20:00):
So in the first version of my story, it makes the characters a little bit more, very logical, very rational, and just does everything just very rationally. And then the feedback I got is, I have a very good friend read it and he was like, he's an amazing person, he's a great person. And he was like, "Chip, I'll be honest, I hate that person." So it doesn't matter as a story, it's just like the person is so unlikeable, that's why he doesn't want to continue. So is a second version. It makes that person, the character more likable. How she makes that character more likable is that you put in some vulnerability sometimes it's like okay maybe it's person have setback because sometimes we can relate to it. So in a lot of ways, it's very interesting. A lot of it is about understand the emotional bit, like how the users feel, not just about the story but also about the characters.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:50):
That is so interesting. Wow. I learned a lot more there than I thought. That was awesome. Really good example. Chip, two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out and maybe work with you or maybe even just share the stuff that you offer if folks want to reach out. And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Chip Huyen (01:21:08):
I'm on social media, LinkedIn, Twitter. I don't post a lot, but I keep telling myself that I should do more because I kind of like the conversation with readers. So I'm actually about to I start a Substack. So I have a placeholder for Substack right now and I'm thinking of doing it for more system thinking because I think it's a very interesting skill. I'm also thinking of doing a YouTube channel on book reviews and basically books than help you think better. So I think it's the first book I'm a review is probably like this book because it's my favorite book growing up and I've been keep on reading it. So yeah, so how can you be helpful? Send me books that you like, books that help you have changed the way you think or change you the way you do anything. So I would appreciate it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:00):
Amazing. I'm excited to read that book.

Chip Huyen (01:22:02):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:03):
Chip, thank you so much for being here.

# Launching and growing a podcast | Chris Hutchins (All the Hacks, Wealthfront, Google)

## Transcript

Chris Hutchins (00:00:00):
Yes, there are four million podcasts. However, there are only about 150,000 podcasts that have had 10 episodes and have published in the last 10 days. So the easiest way to be in that top 5% ish. I don't know what the math there is. About 3%, 4% is to just stick to it. Like if you just do an episode a week for 10 weeks, you're now in the top 4% of all podcasts that anyone has created.

Lenny (00:00:30):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Chris Hutchins. Chris is not only a former product manager, founder and investor, he just this month went full-time on his podcast and the independent creator path. When I was looking for advice on how to build a podcast, Chris shared this awesome deck with a ton of great advice that he's built throughout his journey, and so I thought it'd be fun to spend an episode talking about all the things that you should know about launching and growing a podcast. Chris's podcast is called All the Hacks, covers all the ways to financially optimize your life, and it's one of the biggest business podcasts in the world. Chris has also been on the Tim Ferris Show actually, interviewing Tim Ferris.

(00:01:15):
He's also head of new product strategy at Wealthfront where he took some big, bold bets within the company, which we talk about. Chris is awesome and I am excited for you to learn from him. I bring you Chris Hutchins after a short word from our wonderful sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart.

(00:02:06):
The other day I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all, learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod, take the first step towards an organized happy team today, again at notion.com/lennyspod. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

(00:03:05):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta, over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today. Chris, welcome to the podcast.

Chris Hutchins (00:03:48):
Thanks for having me. I'm excited.

Lenny (00:03:50):
This is going to be a pretty unique episode, I think. You're a product manager and we're going to talk about some of the things you've learned being a PM on some really killer products. But what I want to spend most of our time on is talking about how to launch a podcast. You've built one of the most popular, biggest business podcasts in just like a year and a half. You've taught me some stuff, you've helped other people with their podcast and so I just thought it'd be really helpful just to talk about just the skill of building a podcast and all the things you should know. How does that sound?

Chris Hutchins (00:04:21):
Sounds great. You just did a episode about growing a newsletter business, which I was like, "This is awesome because I have a newsletter and I want it to be bigger." And I think anyone that's has knowledge to share. I talked to a PM yesterday who was like, "Oh, I've got all these product ideas. Maybe I'll start a podcast." So totally, this is fun.

Lenny (00:04:36):
Awesome. That's exactly how I've been thinking about it. First we did the newsletter and then podcast maybe the other things, I don't know what's left.

Chris Hutchins (00:04:42):
YouTube channel.

Lenny (00:04:43):
YouTube channel?

Chris Hutchins (00:04:44):
[inaudible 00:04:44] I don't know if you feel this way, but YouTube. I feel like just putting a podcast on YouTube isn't enough, I need to learn the skills of YouTube.

Lenny (00:04:51):
Yeah. All right. I got to get MrBeast on, that's the next goal. To set a little foundation for folks, to give him a little sense of your background and some of the things you've done in your career. Can you just talk about some of the biggest things you've done in your career, which you've been up to and then what you're up to now and also about your podcast?

Chris Hutchins (00:05:09):
I'm kind of like a happenstance product person. I basically really liked startups, but I didn't know what job I could have as a non-technical person. And I joined my first startup probably 10 years ago and was like, "I will do anything." And they were like, "Do business development." But it turns out we didn't have anyone who also was doing products, so they were like, "What should we build that people will buy?" So I was like, "Well, I got to figure out how we turned this API we were building for location services into a product." Left that to join other startup with a few people we co-founded, did the Jack-of-all-trades role at a startup and then quickly were acquired by Google about a year in, and I went through the interview process and they were like, "You're a PM." And I was like, "Oh, great, what does a PM do?"

(00:05:51):
I didn't really totally know I'd never worked as a PM. Went through Google's kind of like week of training and got thrown into it and I think I've now learned with a lot of time that being a PM is awesome. Being a PM at Google when we were working on Google Plus was not awesome. Transitioned pretty quickly over to Google Ventures, did venture capital for three years, left to start another company trying to make financial advice more affordable, more accessible. Grew that for about two, three years and we ended up selling that company to Wealthfront where I ran a new product strategy. I most recently just left that role after three years and started going full-time on All the Hacks, which is my effort to help everyone upgrade their life, their money, their travel. I'm the spreadsheet for everything, optimizer and do all this research to try to help people live better, happier, wealthier, healthier lives. And I have a podcast where we share all the hacks to do all of it.

Lenny (00:06:43):
Amazing. While we're on the podcast, we're going to dig into this stuff more. Where can folks, find it. It's called All the Hacks.

Chris Hutchins (00:06:48):
Anywhere you listen to podcasts right now, search All the Hacks, you can find it at allthehacks.com. I'd be surprised if someone listening to this is more of a newsletter reader than a podcaster, but allthehacks.com/email is the newsletter too.

Lenny (00:07:02):
Oh, newsletter. I love it. All right, coming back to your last gig at Wealthfront, from what I understand your title was New product Strategy and Andy Rachleff, who was the CEO for a while, kind of legendary figure. He co-founded Benchmark. He's just like this brain that... I listen to him every time I hear him on a podcast. He basically pulled you into Wealthfront and specifically wanted you to focus on figuring out new business ideas, new business lines, new product lines within Wealthfront. Is that right?

Chris Hutchins (00:07:31):
Yeah, so we had an engineer at the time who came up with this idea called Self-Driving Money. I was like, "Gosh, what if you could automate and optimize your entire financial life and you didn't have to rely on human financial advisors?" And we heard from our customers forever that they pay us to not talk to someone, our demographic doesn't want a bunch of humans in the mix. And so we had this idea but we didn't really know what it was. So Andy was like, "Gosh, you've been spending time thinking about financial planning and software and as an entrepreneur, could you come in and help us build Self-Driving Money?"

(00:08:00):
And I was like, "What is it?" They're like, "Well, we got a bunch of ideas from an algorithmic standpoint about how to do it." But, "What exactly is it?" So it was thrown into, "Let's do a bunch of customer research, let's talk to a lot of people and let's try to come up with as audacious of an idea as we could for how you fulfill the promise of automating and optimizing someone's entire financial life to the point that they don't have to think about their finances on a daily basis and they know the right things are happening."

Lenny (00:08:28):
When I think Self-Driving Money, I'm picturing money just driving around, like a Tesla. Money meets Tesla.

Chris Hutchins (00:08:34):
Yeah, the vision I had was what are the core pieces of financial life that are stressful? It's like, "I got to move money, I got to contribute to these different accounts. I want to make sure I have enough to pay my bills." And so what we ended up with was a product called Autopilot that would monitor your core banking account, whether it was a checking account at Wealthfront or not at Wealthfront or whether it was an account at Wealthfront. And we would say, "Let's make sure we leave a certain amount of money." And you could tell us that much. And then we would say, "Great." Now we had basically a series of things to fulfill with any excess. It was like, "Let's make sure you keep this much as a three-month emergency fund, max out your Roth IRA. Let's make sure you max out your 529 for your kids and let's put the rest in your kind of taxable just brokerage account." And we would just periodically say, "Oh, you got extra money, let's sweep it over and do what we need to do with it so you don't have to think about it."

Lenny (00:09:22):
Can you talk about the impact this had on the company and also just how long of a endeavor this was within Wealthfront?

Chris Hutchins (00:09:29):
It was a quick endeavor to try to start talking to people. This was just throw in the mix. I have a very poor sense of time, but let's say somewhere between six and 12 months maybe before we put something really in front of someone that could execute on all the features, there was a lot of prototype UI testing. I think Andy, he's legendary. If anyone listening to this, wants to learn about product market fit, Andy is your guy. I believe he coined the term, he teaches the class at Stanford. And the lesson was really find something people are reaching over the table want, and make sure you have that validation. And so we were putting things in front of people, clickable, full prototypes, and I remember we got to one where someone was like, "Can I go get my husband? I need to show him this."

(00:10:12):
And then I created this thing, which I'm sure is not that new, but I would start pretending that the product existed in the interviews. Only to find out, at the end, people was like, "Oh, it's not out yet." And they're like, "What I want to use..." You could really feel the like, "No, no, no, no, this has to be out. I want to start using it." So we found this thing that a small number of people were very excited about and we knew that a product, this was going to be a high risk bet because people don't automate their financial lives today. People drive to go pick up fast food and if you could with a push of a button, bring it to their house, you're making a thing that they do much more efficient. Right now, well, technically they do this manually, but trusting software to do it is something that we knew would be a higher risk bet.

(00:10:59):
And I think the takeaway, I would say the impact on the company was not as high as we had wanted in that it didn't become this wild top of funnel. I think it's similar to Tesla's autopilot. It's like nobody goes and says, "I just want to buy this car because of this feature." I'm sure some people do, but once you're in the ecosystem, it had huge impact on making it easier for people to start saving more, making it easier for people to be more confident in their finances and just automate all that behavior. So I would say the letdown was, it wasn't the big, huge top of funnel thing where people are like, "Oh, this is all I've ever wanted." Even though if you interview people and you're like, "Gosh, would you like a product that could just automate all this stuff?" They're like, "Yes, I would love it."

(00:11:43):
And then you hand it to them and you're like, "Do you want to use this thing?" And they're like, "Well." It's very hard to test that. And so what we found was it was a win in terms of it. It moved a lot of metrics for saving more money, increasing contributions and that kind of stuff, but it didn't become this growth channel, which Andy would say product market fit is exponential organic growth. So I would say by that metric, we didn't have product market fit, but as a tool to make a system of products so much better. We have the cash account with all the checking features, we have an investing account, we have retirement accounts. So this really brought it all together and that was super valuable.

Lenny (00:12:18):
Awesome. So here's my big question. What have you learned? You spent a lot of time thinking about big bets, big innovations, working within a company to come up with something totally new. What have you learned about how to approach that within a larger company? How do I successfully innovate? How to think about launching big bets, how to structure teams, anything along those lines?

Chris Hutchins (00:12:37):
I've learned a few things and I think some of them I've learned came naturally being a founder before being a PM. But you think that customer research is all you need to build a product at a company, but figuring out how to create excitement internally and get buy-in from other teams because they're the ones that are going to build it. They're the ones that are going to help market. It's all a team effort. Sometimes you get caught up, at least I found, as a PM of like, "Oh, we got the customer insights, we did the testing. It's all positive." And then you show the ratings you got from sub survey or the engagement or some clips and that's not the end of it. The end is creating this compelling vision for what you're building. And then the thing I learned from being a founder is, gosh, you have to state your vision and your mission and why you're here, every all-hands.

(00:13:27):
It seems so crazy because it's core to you why we would build this, what it's purposes, why it's amazing. But as a founder, I was like every week I was like, "Hey everybody, before we get started, this is the mission we're on, this is why we're doing it. This is the thing we're doing in the world." And as a PM sometimes you're like, "Well, I told people three weeks ago and I put it in that email that I sent out to everyone and it was in the top of the PRD, so why hasn't everyone understood why this product exists?" And I realized very quickly that, that same thing is true. So if you want to make a big bet, if you want to make a big impactful product, you have to bring people along with you. And your ability to speak publicly, persuade people, build influence within the company. Those things are all as important as your ability to identify a user need and build a product that solves it.

Lenny (00:14:15):
Awesome. This reminds me a lot of Airbnb, where the founders, all-hands share the vision and the strategy that they came up with that year. Every single all-hands. And it's always like, "Yeah. Yeah, we know. We know." But to your point, it's so powerful and important.

Chris Hutchins (00:14:28):
And some people don't know. Some people we're not paying attention that one all-hands, we're kind of missed it out, skip all-hands. Often there's just, you need everyone to be able to in... And this is a little segue to podcasting and we'll come back to it, but I start my show with saying, "Hello and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, the show about upgrading your life, money and travel." Because I just want everyone to know this is exactly what this show's about, so when their friend asks them a question, they're like, "This is exactly what it is." And the same thing is true about a company's mission, a product, vision, anything you want everyone to really understand it, be able to talk about it succinctly and just have a very cohesive narrative in their head. That's a really big one. I think the other one is just understanding the customer, not just by talking to them, but just being in the mix, playing with all the products.

(00:15:14):
Something I asked a few of my colleagues before this, "What are things that I've particularly done well?" And they were just like, "Gosh, I feel like you understand what's happening outside of the walls of our business better than a lot of people." And maybe that's talking to a lot of other people who are founders talking to a lot of other people, starting companies, going to read all the comments on new financial products on Product Hunt. Really just trying to understand people beyond just customer research. And so that was another thing that I think... As a founder, you're always looking for product market fits, you're always trying to learn. Sometimes at a company it's really easy to get caught up in the research you've already done and the customers you've already talked to and you forget to kind of step outside and go talk to other people and see what other people are doing. And I'd say don't get caught up in what competitors are building and try to feature parody them, but just understanding the space outside of the walls of your business.

Lenny (00:16:06):
One thing I'll add to your point about reminding people of the strategy and the vision is if you can also help them understand how their team and project connects up through that, create kind of a little tree of, "Here's all the teams, what they're doing. Here's all connects to the pillars of focus and themes and then here's how it connects to the North Star metric and or vision mission. "That kind of adds another wrinkle of like, "Oh, wow. I get it. I get why this team's important."

Chris Hutchins (00:16:30):
There's a great analogy, I'm sure if I send a link you could put in the show notes or something about a football team. And it's like the GM's goal is to sell out the tickets and win the conference championship and it actually tiers it down. It's like, "Well, there's a defensive line coordinator." I'm not even that big of a sports person, but it's like the defensive line coordinator's job is just one specific thing, but they kind of explain how it all levels up to this one North Star metric for the company or two in that case. And I think that's just so important and when you're talking to people at your company with your colleagues, it's not just what it does. It's like, "This product will automate people's money movement so they don't have to move their money and it happens automatically." And that's cool, but it's equally as important to remind everyone, "And then they don't have to worry about their money every week and then they don't have to worry that their contributions might leave them without enough money in their checking account to pay their rent."

(00:17:22):
There's these two components of it which are, what does it do, but what's the feeling you want someone to have? And that gets into product vision versus just the product feature set. And whenever we've written product visions statements about things we're building, it's like, "Imagine a world where someone can feel this way about their money." And it's like, "And then this thing will do that." That's the product strategy. It's how you execute on it. And so Reforge has this awesome product strategy kind of product vision roadmap that levels them all up, which I really like as a another resource.

Lenny (00:17:54):
The Reforge. I just recorded another podcast this morning actually, and what you just said reminded me of it, where a lot of people focus too much on features and not enough on benefits. And the stuff you're talking about is just like, "Think about what are the benefits of the person." Versus, "Here's feature one, feature two, feature three."

Chris Hutchins (00:18:10):
The last little skill, and I know you, you've talked about this, but I think it's something that I was fortunate enough to not care about. Which I think is, when you focus too much at a company about like, "Ooh, I want the promotion" you get caught up in this world where you're like, "If I want the promotion, I need to do what my boss wants." And I had this fortunate benefit of... Like my last job, I was the CEO. I didn't care about my title, I didn't care about leveling up. I came in and I was like, "I want to continue trying to execute on this vision of this thing that I wanted to do." What that actually meant was my only metric I cared about was impact and trying to build a product that would work. And I think in any job in any company, it turns out you think that doing what your boss wants is actually what's going to get you promoted.

(00:18:55):
But the people that I've had work for me or I've worked alongside that seem to always be the outperformers, are always the people that are just solely focused on having the most impact on the company. I think the thing I learned, which I thanks to Andy Rachleff for teaching me this is when you push so hard for your ideas and you have really strong beliefs, you have to also make sure you state your intent. Because sometimes people think you're acting out of self-interest. I'd be like, "Oh, we should delete this feature and build this crazy thing. It's going to be amazing." And people are like, "Oh, Chris just thinks his idea is better than everyone."

(00:19:27):
And so he taught me, he's like, "It would go a long way before you said that, you said, "Hey guys, I've got some crazy ideas, but before I say them, I just want you to know that all I care about is that the company is successful. And I think this idea will make the company successful. And that's why I'm so excited about it. I don't need to own it. I don't care who owns it, I'm just really excited about it."" And when you state your intent, you give people a little bit of ease in thinking you know what it might be. And even though I'm sure half the people listening work at a company where their culture is like assume best intent is one of the pillars, it's still our nature to assume that if someone's shooting down an idea we have that maybe it's out of their own self-interest.

(00:20:03):
And I've learned that when you have crazy ideas and when you're pushing back against a lot of people, if you can make sure you constantly remind them why you're doing it and what you care about, it goes a lot further than if you just kind of come in there with sharp elbows and try to push for crazy things.

Lenny (00:20:19):
Reminds me, I think Andy is the person who on a podcast once said that every year he picks like a, "We're going to bet the company on this idea." Kind of project, is that?

Chris Hutchins (00:20:28):
I would say we've done that a few times. I think the thing that I always told people that I wanted to work on is like, "I want to work on a project that if successful makes everything we do as a company today feel like it's not that important because we did something that was 10 times bigger than everything we're doing today. And what we're doing now is just 10% of the company." Those are the kind of crazy ideas I like to work on. They're very hard sometimes you're like, "Ooh, I've got one." And then it just doesn't work. Sometimes you do one and it takes a turn. But I think that when companies find those things, they're so powerful. But if you don't have the buy-in for management that that's your goal... Andy, he always talks about slugging average, not batting average. He's like, "I don't care if you hit the ball every time. If one in 10 times you hit a home run that's better than someone who hits it every three out of 10 times but gets out a lot."

(00:21:15):
He thought about that and the balance. He's written a lot internally about the balance between working on iterative improvements to current features and then taking big bets and trying to find the balance amongst it all. But I think he does believe there is always exploration necessary for taking big bets and trying to take swings that could have outsized impact. You got to balance it because you're often wrong. And I think that's something that I was like, "That's the thing I want to work on." As someone who is kind of running a company, when you get to go to a big company and you're like, "Now I can solely focus just on this big product bet. I don't have to worry about hiring and recruiting and all these other things." So that was fun.

Lenny (00:21:52):
Speaking of being solely focused on something, let's talk about the podcast. So this is kind of the new thing that you're going to be focused on full-time. You just left Wealthfront and you launched the podcast maybe a year and a half ago, correct me if I'm wrong, by a year and a half ago. The podcast is Top 30, top 40 business podcast. It's probably gone a lot of higher at some points. And so there's a bunch of questions I want to ask about just how you launched this thing and built this thing. But broadly, what did I miss about the [inaudible 00:22:18] framing of the podcast?

Chris Hutchins (00:22:18):
Oh, yeah. That's it. It's about 18 months old. Been doing, gosh, probably about almost 100 episodes, not quite there. Weekly show and I went on parental leave part of the last 18 months and I tried to balance family and just grinding on this and it's been a passion project on the side and I'm very excited to see all the different kind of legs and tentacles that the brand and the content can have.

Lenny (00:22:45):
What kind of benefits and good things have come out of having a podcast and launching a podcast or running a podcast?

Chris Hutchins (00:22:51):
I think we all run into people and you're like, "Gosh, this person's really smart. I wish that I could just pick their brain for an hour." And sometimes you could just email them, be like, "Hey, could we schedule some time in a month and we could just chat?" But that sometimes just feels like a weird thing to ask. The podcast gives you this great platform, you're like, "Well, I have a podcast. And so I would love to invite you on and help you amplify your message and spend an hour trying to understand everything about topic X, Y, Z." And sometimes it's really nerdy and nuanced and sometimes it's broad, but being able to have a reason. I think one of my first episodes was with a guy named Morgan Housel who wrote a book called Psychology of Money. I read the book, I was like, "This is a great book. I have so many questions."

(00:23:32):
But like what I'm I going to od? Randomly email this person I don't know and say, "Hey, I loved your book. Can I just ask you questions for 45 minutes?" I would never do that. But I randomly emailed him and said, "Hey, we've never met. But I have a podcast." I don't even think it had launched, "It's launching next week, but I'm really excited about it. Could I pick your brain?" And he was like, "Sure." So I would say the biggest thing is it just gives you a platform to explore your curiosities on things provided that you can really focus the thing that you talk about on one vertical, niche, something so that people learn what it's about. Because the hardest part about podcast growth is there's like four million podcasts and you've got to find a way to stand out in a sea of many podcasts.

Lenny (00:24:12):
Let's actually talk about that. I was going to ask you about that. There's like four million you said, that seems right. It's probably a four million launched to date. Also, if you're someone that's thinking about, "Should I do a podcast? Should I not do a podcast?" Do you have any advice for just signs that this might be a worthwhile endeavor with your time versus signs you probably should not do this, do not even-

Chris Hutchins (00:24:34):
I'll give you two perspectives. So one is, yes, there are four million podcasts. However, there are only about 150,000 podcasts that have had 10 episodes and have published in the last 10 days. So the easiest way to be in that top, I don't know, 5% ish. I don't know what the math there is, about %3, 4%, is to just stick to it. If you just do an episode a week, for 10 weeks, you're now in the top 4% of all podcasts that anyone has created. Now, that doesn't mean you're in the top 4% of the 150 active podcasts. So what I would say to that is... I mean, maybe you have a massive platform already, in which case just go start the podcast. But if you don't already have a massive platform, it is unlikely statistically, that this thing is going to work. So absolutely, do not start the podcast if you wouldn't do it for free, making no amount of money in perpetuity or as long as you want to experiment with.

(00:25:31):
That's one thing I'll throw out there is you are most likely going to start a podcast and it will not take off and be wildly successful. However, I've met plenty of people who have hundreds of listeners and hundreds of episodes and they stuck at it because they truly loved the thing. If you don't know if you love the thing, it's very easy, which is what I did to say, "I'm going to have one season of eight episodes." And I committed to record eight interviews and put eight interviews out in the world. That was it all I committed to myself. And I said, "If that doesn't work, then I will be fine and say, "Here is season one and there's just not a season two." And I would be okay with it." So you can commit to see if you like it before you do it, but chances are, and you might have found something similar when you started creating content, it's like for the first six, nine months, there's no revenue coming in.

(00:26:23):
It's a lot more work than it seems. Everyone I know that has no podcast and goes to having a podcast, they're like, "Oh my gosh, I thought this was just once, one hour a week, I just talked to somebody." It's like, "Now, I have to prepare for it. I got to write up show notes, I got to make sure it's edited properly, I got to recruit people. Turns out you reach out to 10 people, two reply, one is willing to schedule this week." There's just a lot that goes into it. So I'd say only do it if you're excited to do it, even if five people are on the other end.

Lenny (00:26:49):
Talking about the time investment, how long does it take you per episode, hours-wise? And then how long did it take you to kind of prep launch?

Chris Hutchins (00:26:59):
And this has evolved a bit as the podcast has generated enough revenue to hire other people. But in general, I would probably spend, depending on how well I knew the topic or the person, anywhere from two to 10 hours preparing for an interview. If someone wrote a book at the beginning I was like, I got to read the whole book, I got to take notes. Then I was like, "Well, if I read the whole book and take notes, then I kind of know everything. So I'm going to read a few chapters." I wanted to listen to everyone on different interviews. Some people are really hard, some people have only talked about one topic and you want to get them on another topic. I interviewed Carrie Walsh Jennings, who's a three time gold medalist at the Olympics for beach volleyball. And I listened to every interview she'd ever done because only 3% of each interview was about not volleyball stuff.

(00:27:45):
And I was like, "Well, I don't want to talk about volleyball, I want to talk about performance and how you can train." She won a gold medal while she was pregnant. This is a serious level of physical and mental preparedness that I wanted to dig into. So that's one big piece of it. After it's done, then it really depends on the style of show. If you have this NPR style editing where it's very narrative driven, it could take you a long time to go through the editing. For me with interview style, I think it takes me about an hour to go back and listen to it at a little, speed up pace. And then go in and be like, "Ah, this thing wasn't worth keeping in. Or I mean, we had to repeat something and let's cut that out, or this person stumbled on their words."

(00:28:27):
Fortunately there's some amazing software. Now I use a piece of software called Descript, which basically imports all the audio, transcribes it to, let's call it like 95% accuracy. And then you can edit the podcast like you would edit a Google Doc. It's crazy. You're just like, "Oh, let's delete all the ums, control F, um. Ignore all ums." And then you listen through it and you're like, "Oh, that um, was really necessary, let's put it back in." And little edits like that. But that tool makes the editing process really easy. From the get-go, I had an audio engineer who would actually mix and master and add in the music and that kind of stuff.

(00:29:02):
So I would say each guest is probably at least 10 hours plus probably two or three hours of coordination and outreach to three or four people that you reach out to in order to get the one. Now I've since, hired someone who helps do a little bit of research. So they might go listen to two or three episodes, read a couple chapters of book and put up some notes with links to those various places. So I can then take that and take my time from 10 hours to three hours.

Lenny (00:29:31):
I'll share my experience briefly. It's a little different, which is really interesting to hear your experience. So I launched the complete opposite of your advice, which is I just launched big with like, "I will do this forever. This is my new thing. I have 40 guests lined up, here's who they're going to be." And I think it's partly because I already went through that initial period of uncertainty, whether I can keep this up with a newsletter, which you said eight to nine months. Which is exactly how long it took me to do the newsletter every week to get to a point where I'm like, "Yes, I can keep this up for years. Let's start adding a paid plan." So I think I was just more confident that I can keep at it.

(00:30:06):
And then I actually planned to monetize from the beginning. I think partly again, because I had the newsletter already. And I will say, so I don't edit that myself. I have a production group that is a game changer. So you can save a lot of time and I don't know if you've gone to a producer or anything, but I feel like most people eventually do.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:25):
I've now switched to someone who went back, listened to the first 20 or 30 episodes and said, "Oh, I get what you like to cut out of a conversation." And I'll end and say, "Hey, take that 90-minute conversation. And I think there's probably 20 minutes to cut out." And they do a very good job of getting pretty close.

Lenny (00:30:42):
Awesome.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:42):
To the point that some episodes I'm just like, I don't even look at it.

Lenny (00:30:45):
Yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:45):
It's just recorded and done.

Lenny (00:30:46):
Yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:30:47):
When it comes to launch, I would say one of my suggestions is to get a few things in the bag. Line up... You don't want to launch and then be scrambling. So I tend to think launching with two or three episodes, either all at once or in a week is a really valuable strategy. You talked about in the intro, you're like, "Sometimes it's been a higher ranked, but top 30." I think I've been top 100 in the business category all the way to top five in the business category, maybe top 10 and just all the way in between.

(00:31:18):
And the reason for that is that the ranking charts are all driven by different variables than you would imagine. They're driven a lot by momentum of new subscribers, at least on the Apple charts than actual downloads. So I have a friend who launched a podcast and had a huge following on social media and so out the gate was able to garner a ridiculous number of new subscribers to the point that she was the number two podcast overall, all podcasts in the world.

Lenny (00:31:45):
Holy shit.

Chris Hutchins (00:31:45):
It is crazy for a week or two, a woman named Erika Colberg, she has a podcast called Erika Talk.

Lenny (00:31:51):
Oh, yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:31:53):
But it's not number two anymore because it's so driven on the momentum of how often you can get new subscribers. She's still in the top 100 of business podcasts, but to get to the number two spot overall, it's all about number of new followers per hour. And if you can get a ton of traffic early on, you can drive that. And I will say the value of you doing that is now you've got this screenshot of like, "Look, I was top 10." And by the way, she did the same thing I did. The moment I was top 10, the second I was in top 10, I immediately took all those guests that were on my dream list and I was like, "Hey, I've got a top 10 podcast. Go look at it right now and see that it's in the top 10." So you can always say that forever after it happens once, you can always use those things. So capitalize on that.

(00:32:39):
So you had the newsletter before. I had a newsletter I'd written on casually for various things throughout my life and for my last startup. And so I kind of put it all together to try to carry a big launch so that we really spike the rankings, maybe qualify for Apple does this new and noteworthy thing. And so there's a lot of stuff you can do to build momentum at launch, but at the end of the day, all the momentum in the world doesn't matter if your content's not good. So I try to say content for me is product market fit for building software. It's like you need to have a good podcast. And so if you launch big, one of the downsides is you're like, you don't really get that moment of tweaking and testing and seeing how it is. And I will say, I did five episodes in the fifth one. I was like, "This is number one." The first one I recorded came out, I don't know, fifth. But the fifth one I recorded came out first because I just knew it was episode one.

(00:33:32):
And the guest that I had on, and we talked about travel hacks, a guy named Leigh Rowan, he's come on twice. It was just like this awesome energy episode about everything you want to know about travel hacks, allthehacks.com/one. So save yourself the need to scroll through the whole list. But if your content isn't a unique perspective, you don't have a unique way of saying it. It's going to be really hard to stand out in the sea of podcasts. So I always say, be you, be authentic. Try to be someone's favorite. Don't try to be everyone's okay podcast. I remember Tim Ferris was saying... I got a chance to go on Tim Ferris's show and interview him about podcasting. And he's like, "Look, I did an episode about how to..." I think it was like how to make violins or something. And he's like, "I was so fascinated about this. 80% of people were like, what is this episode? But 20% of people thought it was one of the best episodes I'd done that year."

(00:34:24):
And I think half of his top 10 episodes of all time are people you wouldn't recognize. So I would focus on what gets you excited, not focus on what you think will move the metrics. Because every time I have a guest where I'm like, "I really think this person's going to move the metrics." It doesn't. And then I interview someone who no one has ever heard of, and I get these emails like, "Wow, that was such a good episode. Can't be. Oh man, I'm so glad you did that one." I was like, "You don't even know this person is."

Lenny (00:34:50):
Very similar experience in many ways across a lot of the things that you said. Something that you did mention that you shared previously with me is, and this is advice that I've thought about a lot, is you should be somebody's favorite podcast. That's like a sign that you're doing something right. Can you expand on that?

Chris Hutchins (00:35:08):
There's this whole idea of your build your 1000 true fans. And I think anytime you're creating something in the world, you want people to be your advocates for it because those are the people that are going to share it. Those are the people that are going to write the reviews, those are the people that are going to send you the ideas. Those are the people that are ultimately, when you make a call-out on a podcast like, "Hey, I'm looking for someone to help build this company or this enterprise." That are going to reach out and want to work for you. I find it so valuable to build that relationship with people. And it's even more valuable with podcasting because podcasting is such an intimate medium. You're in someone's ear and they're actively listening to you while they're going about their life. They're going on a walk, they're [inaudible 00:35:52], but you're right there.

(00:35:53):
And I get so many emails, they're like, "Ah, I feel like I'm just sitting on the couch with you while you're talking to me." And you create this really close relationship and the more you can create for those people and be their favorite time of the day, their favorite thing. Someone once told me, "Make sure you're consistent with the time you release because you'll get people that are like, "It's Wednesday morning, where's my episode? This is how I... It's become a ritual in my life."" And so, I don't know. I just think it's so valuable to build that early kind of excited user base and those 1000 true fans that I always try to put something out that's someone's favorite.

(00:36:30):
And I actually surveyed the audience about 50 episodes in and ask, "Which was your favorite episode?" And every episode except one was someone's favorite. There's one episode that, no one's favorite. So I'm still waiting. Maybe next time I survey someone will be like, "No. No, that one was my favorite." But every other episode of 50 episodes was someone's favorite. And it was like the coolest feeling knowing that every episode was someone's favorite.

Lenny (00:36:57):
That's exactly what happens with my newsletter. I get a reply with every newsletter and someone's like, "This is my favorite one yet." Okay, somebody really likes this one. It's so interesting.

Chris Hutchins (00:37:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:37:09):

Chris Hutchins (00:38:07):
This is an interesting one. So my podcast actually started as a parenting podcast from the perspective of dads. And I was doing all this research. I built this probably 75-page Notion doc all about parenting. It was like I had a kanban board for all the things I needed to do in each trimester of the pregnancy. And then the fourth trimester after the baby was born, I had all these checklists. I had a stroller spreadsheet that had, at least, let's call it 15, 20 different features that you could filter on. Dimensions, cubic volume of when you sum up the dimension, everything. It was crazy. And I was like, "I'm so obsessed with this." And I was like, "Nobody's really taking this kind of crazy optimized approach to processing parental information except a few people." Emily Oster, by the way, if anyone out there wrote a few books, I really loved her pragmatic science approach. But I just didn't see a lot of this and I especially didn't see as much content coming from dads.

(00:39:07):
And I was like, "I'm so excited." And then we had our daughter and for some reason I was like, "I love her. But the topic of parenting and optimizing every aspect of it just wasn't what it was before we had the child as after." I was like, "Wow. But I bought this microphone and I figured out how to use all the editing software and I had never even recorded an episode." And it just ended up that I was like, "That topic just wasn't right for me." And I went on another friend of mine's podcast guy named Kevin Rose, who was a co-founder of a company we started, he started Digg back in the day. And in the middle of it we'd been talking about this, I've been brainstorming ideas, and in the middle of his podcast he's like, "Hey, tell us about your new podcast."

(00:39:50):
And then I was like, "Kevin, I haven't nailed down what it is." And he's like, "Yeah, it's fine. Why don't you just record a response to that question and email it to me before this episode goes live and then you could just tell everyone what your podcast is about." And then I was like, "Okay, I'll think about it." And the next day he was like, "Dude, I need this by Friday." I was like, "Oh, man. So I have two days to figure out what my podcast is." And I talked to a lot of people and they're like, "What do you love, what do you love talking about?" I was like, "Gosh." What question someone said is, when you're at a dinner table, what's the thing that you talk about where you notice that everyone at the table is leaning in and trying to listen and pick your brain on and maybe sends you a text after?

(00:40:27):
And I was like, "It's probably all the hacks I have for traveling for free, for getting upgrades, for saving money, for shopping online, for optimizing my health or anything, house hacking, saving money on my rent." And every time I bring those up, people are like, "I like saving money. I want to travel for free." And they're leaning in, they're like, "Which credit card do I get? Is this one bad? What about this one?" And I couldn't come up with a name. I had hundreds of names. It was like life upgraded, optimized your life. But every time I described what it was, I just said, "It's life upgraded. I'll teach you all the hacks to do this." And then someone, I can't even remember who was like, "What about just All the Hacks?" And then I looked and I was like, "Is allthehacks.com available?"

(00:41:08):
I was like, "What? It's available." It's like... Get the domain. And then I very quickly recorded a response to Kevin's question, which was like, "Yes, I'm launching a podcast called All the Hacks, here's what it is." And I had to go create a trailer and upload it all in three days. And I think I was fortunate that I just had the time pressure that I had a thing to get out. So I'd say one, what do you love talking about at the dinner table? What gets you excited? What do people reach out to you for expertise on? What do you spend your time going down deep rabbit holes on the internet on? Because all of those things are going to be part of your life as a creator. And then two, if there's any way you can force yourself to just have to make a decision because I get stuck in this analysis paralysis, that's great.

(00:41:51):
So find some friend of yours that's like, "I'm tweeting about your podcast on Friday, or I'm going to include you in my newsletter next month." And give yourself an artificial deadline or even a real deadline to just put a stake in the ground. And you could change the name, you could pivot the topic, you could pivot the style of content. All those things can happen after, but just get started because you'll get to learn whether you like doing it, how it feels. And you could always... This is another fun hack. You could create a podcast and make a private feed and people can add a private feed to their podcast app. So if you want to get some feedback, you can just send people a URL and say, "Hey, paste this URL and the Apple Podcast player and listen to a couple episodes and let me know what you think." Before you make that plunge to send it to the whole world.

Lenny (00:42:34):
Awesome. I actually heard that interview with Kevin Rose back in the day, and I checked out the podcast, I think I actually subscribed and it felt very natural. So nice job.

Chris Hutchins (00:42:43):
Yeah. Little did you know that it was inserted in post production, recorded on a separate system. Yeah.

Lenny (00:42:49):
So people listening to this made feel like, "Hey, I don't have Kevin Rose announcing my podcast. How do I get started? How do I get my initial traction in my podcast?" Do you have any advice there for people that are just launching things they could do to get their initial set of subscribers and get the word out and get some kind of traction without a friend with a huge platform?

Chris Hutchins (00:43:08):
Yes. I interviewed a guy named Nick Gray, and it was a fun conversation because he wrote a book called The 2-Hour Cocktail Party, and it was all about how to build relationships by throwing the best cocktail parties. And it was very tactical guide, but one of the things he does is he has a friend's newsletter. And he basically created a newsletter and every time he meets someone that is a friend of his, he sends him a note, says, "Can I add you to my friend's newsletter?" People say, yes. And he just shares, "Here's some cool articles I'm reading. Here's a cool thing I'm doing in my life. Here's a picture." It's instead of waiting till the holidays to send your holiday card to everyone that's like, "Here's what happened this year. Or maybe now we've..." That's what my grandparents did. Now it's just like, "Here's a photo of the family."

(00:43:45):
He just sends it out. I don't even know what the cadence is. It's just like every now and then I get an email and it's like, "Oh, this what Nick's up to, this is pretty cool." Anyone can subscribe to it. And he shares all these great things. He's like, "Ah, I was thinking about a virtual assistant. Here's 75 things that I dreamed up that I could send to a virtual assistant." I was like, "That's really cool." "Here's how I tweak my Calendly. And I sent the Calendly to you. It's like I added a few little things in it that..." He had suggestions to just make it a little more friendly, make it a little more comfortable. The one I loved was like, "If I'm not arrived within two minutes of the start time, here is my cell phone number. I just want to make sure I'm prompt. And people know that."

(00:44:19):
And so, one thing is, before you even get started, find a way to just build an audience of your closest friends, family, colleagues, and throw stuff out in the world. You don't have to do it weekly or monthly. You could just send it out every quarter, every six months, it doesn't matter. But start to build something. So I started with a new, I think it was on MailChimp, called Life Updates. And I think I sent five of these out 10 years ago, and I hadn't really sent one out in seven years, but I still had this email newsletter with 1100 people on it that I just collected from life. And so that was one thing. Look, you can always go out and try to find other creative ways to partner with people. So you have a newsletter, but you don't have a podcast.

(00:45:03):
Could you use your newsletter to promote something? Could you find someone who has a platform that you could trade your services for promotional things? Yeah, I can think of any couple examples where there's been something where I've been really excited use and I'm like, "Hey, could I talk to my audience about this thing? And then you could let me use this?" So if there's anything, whether it's consulting services or anything, you could maybe trade those services for other people with an audience to share and promote you. I think that happens more often than not. But again, it all matters if you have good content. So I'd say the first thing, the most important thing to grow a piece of content is just have it be good. And it's hard to know what's good. Put it out in the world, see if people like it. Maybe get your reps in before you even try some of these growth things.

(00:45:46):
I think I was fortunate to have done some public speaking before, so I felt a little more comfortable. But if you... You mentioned MrBeast earlier, he's very public about the fact, if you go back 10 years and look at his YouTube videos, they were not exciting like they are now. And it took him a long time. And I think that's the reality with content is, for almost every person that you see out there and you're like, "Wow, they have this huge audience. It's so awesome." You go back 10 years and you're like, "Oh, well their first episode wasn't that awesome. It was actually kind of crazy. Or it wasn't that interesting. And they got better over time. They learned what their audience liked, they built a following." So those things are all there. Find communities. If you're talking about a very specific thing, I never forgot Gary Vaynerchuk's lesson, gosh, he probably told me this 13 years ago.

(00:46:32):
He was like, "When he was starting Wine Library." Which most people don't maybe even know that that's what he was originally known for. He wanted to build this business and so he went on Twitter and he looked for every single person that asked a question about wine and he at replied them back. And so a tactic that I think could work really well is, for me, I'm like, "I love travel. I love points and miles." I can just search Twitter and find every person on Twitter, every person on Reddit, every person on a forum, whatever that's asking a question about the thing my podcast answers, and go in and try to be a value add to them. I guarantee that if you have a podcast and your favorite thing is quilting and in your bio on Twitter, maybe Twitter's not the right platform, but let's just go with the analogy, right?

(00:47:14):
Your bio says , "Top quilting podcast." And you go find everyone that's asking questions about quilting and answer their questions with strong, good answers. They're going to look at your bio and be like, "Oh my gosh, this person knows their stuff about this topic. Let's go see what they do." And you have these advocates they share in their communities and it grows over time. I'll come back to one more tactic, which I didn't do, but there's no built-in distribution engine in podcasting. TikTok, you make a TikTok video, TikTok sends it to like a hundred people and if no one likes it dies. But if like a few people like it, they send it to more people and more people. And YouTube does the same thing. Instagram Reels does the same thing. Podcasting doesn't have that, and so it's just a slow growth effort and you just have to be okay with that.

(00:47:59):
But what I didn't do early on, which you can do is you can make clips of your podcast and you could put those clips on these channels that do have that built in distribution. And if those clips do take off, they could build a massive audience. And so there's a guy, Danny Miranda, he has a podcast and he launched, didn't have a huge following, but he created clips of every single episode, lots of clips. He didn't know what was the most interesting piece of content, so he made a clip for everything. He built millions and millions of views on TikTok and Instagram, just by creating content from his podcast that drove downloads over to his podcast. Helped him build his audience, and he built an audience on social faster than I have a and bigger than I currently have out of just being all in on distributing his content on platforms that had growth engines built into it.

Lenny (00:48:48):
The last point is interesting because what I've been hearing, and I've actually experienced it, so I have TikTok clips, I have YouTube videos and YouTube shorts, and I find they drive followers within the platform and downloads and views, but I haven't seen any actual impact on the podcast. And maybe people can measure it or maybe they can tell something's happening, but from what I hear and what I've seen, I don't know if it actually drives a lot of downloads, but it's still really useful, still useful to have an awesome TikTok account and an awesome YouTube account.

Chris Hutchins (00:49:16):
He said, "Look..." I don't know if it drives downloads, but it drives brand awareness for me.

Lenny (00:49:20):
Yeah.

Chris Hutchins (00:49:20):
And he's had multiple guests be like, "Oh yeah, I'd love to go on your show." One of the clips he made, he made a clip talking about Ray Dalio. And Ray Dalio was like reposting his clip. And so he was getting a lot of engagement with people that would be very difficult to reach out to saying, "I have this many downloads." But because he was getting thousands or even millions of views across a platform, it gave him the credibility to do a lot of things that he might not have been able to do now. Then he's gone and translated that into, "Well, let's go bring some of these people with really, really wide distribution of their podcast onto my show and let's do an interview with them." Then for the most part, people are like, "Oh, let's distribute that content to my audience that you had me on."

(00:50:03):
One thing he did that was so good is he did all of his videos in person, so he would fly to someone record in person, and the quality of the video for an in-person video was just so much better than you get doing a remote thing. It's a lot harder. It's a lot more work and it doesn't even impact the audio, but he would make the best quality clips, and Erika Colberg does the same thing. And she would deliver them and he would deliver them to the guests, and now the guest starts using those clips because he spent so much time trying to come up with the best clips, the highest quality, best produced that made his guests look amazing. And then those guests were much more likely to share those in their audiences and all of a sudden you've got a lot of momentum.

(00:50:44):
Does that translate to downloads? I'll give you a little shout-out, Danny has a paid newsletter on Substack where he actually breaks down all his downloads and all his tactics on how this is all working for him. And it's fascinating, it's called In The DM, because he did a lot of his early on recruiting with guests in DMS on social media. But it's to be seen, how much of an impact it can have on your podcast, but it certainly builds other things that are, I'd say like indirect... There's no direct attribution, but that doesn't mean that things aren't overall going up. And then the last one is finding other podcasts that you can go on as an expert in some area. So hopefully, you're starting a podcast because you believe something is exciting in the world, you love it, you have a passion about it, you're an expert in it.

(00:51:32):
Take that thing and go present yourself to other podcasts. And they all have listeners that are listening to podcasts, so it's the best medium. Because yes, someone who likes short form, 60-second videos is maybe not the best target demo to listen to a one-hour audio only thing, those two are very different behaviors. But if you can find something you're really good at and present a value add to people to come on their show, then that could help you build your audience while adding value to their audience. And I think as someone who gets a lot of pitches from people to come on their podcast, I will only caveat it with, do the work to make sure you're really presenting a compelling pitch. You're going to get a lot of nos, that's just how it works. I've pitched myself to go on lots of shows and sometimes I get nos also.

(00:52:19):
Many times I get nos, but I never send an email that's like someone would read it and be like, "This person obviously, doesn't know what they're talking about." But I get so many, they're like, "Oh, I'd love to have my client come on your podcast. They love talking about building a business." And I was like, "Well, I don't really interview people about that." If someone came to me and was like, "Here is a tactic to improve your life that I think your audience would benefit from and here's why my expertise makes me the best person to talk about it." I'd be much more open to it because they actually understood what my show is about.

Lenny (00:52:51):
Yeah, I get it. At least, one email a day with one of these pitches and I know exactly what you mean. I generally, don't reply because it's just not even worth trying to convince them they're not a fit.

Chris Hutchins (00:53:00):
Yes.

Lenny (00:53:01):
Shifting gears a little bit, I want to talk about your stack, your podcasting stack. What do you use on the software? What do you use the hardware? Mic, headphones. What do you recommend?

Chris Hutchins (00:53:11):
On a mic? I started out with the ATR2100X, I think it is a great entry level mic. It's under a $100. You can use old analog XLR cables if you want, but it's also USB. That mic got me through 50 episodes. I have since upgraded to a Shure SM7B, which is the XLR compatriot to, I think you have a Shure MB7.

Lenny (00:53:36):
Yeah, I have the USB version if that's what-

Chris Hutchins (00:53:38):
Yeah, exactly. And those are two great kind of upgrade mics that I think... I like the sound quality a little better, but every time I'm traveling and I'm not sure if something's going to come up, if I can make a recording and if I have to record the intro, do a remote interview, I still carry the ATR2100X, because I just think it's an easy thing to have and it works really well. I record everything on Riverside. I put everything into Descript. I plug my XLR mic into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, which is like a audio interface. I would say I've gone a little bit overboard with video, so we were talking right before this started. I have a Sony a7C, which is like a mirrorless, full frame camera behind a $60 Amazon teleprompter so that I can make direct eye contact with the camera while an iPad that's... I don't know, it's like 10-year-old iPad sits under it and projects as a second screen for my computer, using this-

Lenny (00:54:36):
[inaudible 00:54:36] If you're not watching this YouTube, you got to check out the YouTube video at least for five seconds to see Chris just staring at you. I've never seen this on a podcast video before.

Chris Hutchins (00:54:43):
Yeah,

Lenny (00:54:44):
It's the future.

Chris Hutchins (00:54:45):
So I have that set up using a iPad, running an app called Duet Display. I don't do the editing. I've worked with one editor that uses Audition and one that uses Pro Tools. I don't have a strong opinion there. Oh, my favorite of all, my friend of mine, Brendan Mulligan, started this company called Podpage. And so for people who don't know a lot about how podcasting works, there's a hosting platform, I use Simple Cast. I liked that they were one of the only hosting platforms that has a really affordable self-serve option, but also has a really great pro, all the features that you would want in the future for monetization, everything so that you wouldn't have to switch. Not to say that you know couldn't switch easily, it's pretty easy to switch. How it works is you upload an MP3 file, you write out all your show notes, the title of the episode, everything, and they create an RSS feed for you.

(00:55:36):
You could literally just create an RSS feed, right? That's all it really is, and you could host everything on your own on AWS or something, but they make it really easy for not that much money. And then you go distribute that RSS feed to all of these different players, so the Apple Podcast app, Spotify, et cetera. And one of the things that's amazing is this site Podpage, you submit the RSS feed to this website and they go in and say, "Oh, here's the description of the podcast. Here's each episode. Here's the cover art you submitted for that episode. Here's the title, here's the show notes." And they just auto-generate a website for you. And then they give you the tools like a WordPress style set of tools to go and change the header, change the descriptions. They're like, "You could go in and tweak things." But every night on Wednesday, or I guess Wednesday morning at 2:00 AM my podcast goes live. And at 2:05 Podpage has already noticed, the RSS feed is up-to-date and that site is posted. I don't have to do anything.

(00:56:30):
They even monitor for the slug, like the URL slug I put in as a checkout. This podcast at this URL and podcast page says, "Oh, that's the URL you want them to check out. We're going to inherit that and put it in so you don't even have to give us any information. And we'll just know the URL that you want to set this episode up on." I think that is a super simple way to build a podcasting website. The only other thing, we didn't talk at all about analytics at all, but I use Chartable for analytics. And podcast analytics are a little crazy because you don't have a lot to go on. But Chartable is a really cool analytics platform that becomes really interesting when you start to cross promo with other shows or run ads for other shows or do anything like that because they basically can track IP address of downloads.

(00:57:22):
And I say track, I don't know who's listening to what from where in any kind of very specific way. But what I do know is if I'm doing a cross promo with another show where I'm saying, "Hey, check out a podcast I love." And they're saying, "Check out a podcast I love." It actually says, "Oh, how many of the people that downloaded this episode actually went and listened to this other episode?" So you can get direct attribution of podcast listeners going from one podcast to another. So that is a really important tool in my kind of running a podcast toolkit, but it doesn't matter as much until you start focusing on growth and doing promotions and stuff like that.

Lenny (00:57:58):
Awesome. I host on Substack as maybe one difference. I use Podpage for my site, my producer/editor people actually use Descript/Descript also. That's kind of what they use for editing professionally, so it's good for amateur hour and good for professionals as well. I use Chartable, something's up with my Chartable, I think I've told you, or it doesn't count my Spotify downloads. It's kind of a pain in the butt, but it's still-

Chris Hutchins (00:58:21):
Which is funny by the way, because for anyone listening doesn't know, Spotify actually owns Chartable. So the one platform your Chartable doesn't get good download data from, is the one that it is owned by.

Lenny (00:58:33):
Yep. I do not understand what is going on. I've talked to them and they don't know what the fix is. It doesn't matter anyway. I get enough analytics other places. There's one other site I'd recommend called Podstatus that just gives you quick access to where you're on the charts every day, gives you these cool line charts. Which Chartable sort of does, but it's a lot simpler on Podstatus. But otherwise-

Chris Hutchins (00:58:53):
Awesome.

Lenny (00:58:53):
All the same stuff. One other question real quick. Say someone launches their podcast, what would be a good download goal to aim for, when you're getting started that's like, "Maybe this is working." Do you have a sense of a threshold try to hit?

Chris Hutchins (00:59:08):
I wouldn't think of a threshold to hit because you could launch with a huge audience and have a terrible podcast and you might hit 10,000 downloads and it would be crazy, right? You would feel really good. So I would care more about the direction than about the number because even the Apple charts, they're more momentum driven. You could have one download, but the next week you have a lot more and a lot more and a lot more. You would actually rise in the charts faster than someone whose podcast is kind of stagnant doing X number of downloads. If you have 3000 downloads an episode or something like that, you're in the top 1% or something. So you know, don't have to get to crazy numbers to be in the top of the charts.

Lenny (00:59:08):
Yeah, I heard-

Chris Hutchins (00:59:08):
I would say-

Lenny (00:59:54):
I heard a similar number, 3000.

Chris Hutchins (00:59:55):
The top podcasts are doing millions in episode, but that's like top 10, top 20, top 30. The next tranche of the top 50 are doing probably hundreds of thousands of downloads. But outside of the top two, 300, it's in the 10,000s of downloads per episode. And this is a little bit variable if you have a daily show or a weekly show or something. But I would say if you cross 10,000 downloads an episode, you are now taken seriously by a lot of people. So I had conversations early on with networks like iHeartMedia and different podcast networks that wanted to bring in the show and would do all that, and that all started at 10 to 15, maybe 20,000 downloads an episode. But by no means would I expect anyone to get there right away. Even I didn't get there right away. It took time even with a few friends to make announcements and stuff, it took time.

(01:00:50):
So forget how many downloads you get on your first three episodes because you're probably going to tell everyone in the world and you're going to use all your social capital to boost those. And then look at how many downloads you get on your fourth and fifth and sixth and does it go up? Does it stay stagnant? Apple and Spotify actually give you really cool data about how long people are listening. Do they drop off halfway through? You could start to be like, "Oh, do people stay for the whole episode?" I will say I haven't found a good site for benchmarks, but it's like the average podcast I think probably has less than 50% of listeners by the end. So don't be turned off when you say, "Wow, only 40% of people made it to the end." That's not horrible. I think my best episode, it might be like 65 or 70% of people made it all the way to the end. It's not 99.

Lenny (01:01:37):
What I like about those charts is you can see what percentage of people skip the ads and then just keep continuing. It's like a bump-

Chris Hutchins (01:01:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:42):
The mid-rolls and the-

Chris Hutchins (01:01:44):
[inaudible 01:01:44] And it's not as high as I thought.

Lenny (01:01:46):
10, 20% depending on-

Chris Hutchins (01:01:47):
Maybe 15%. It depends.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Yeah. Not bad at all.

Chris Hutchins (01:01:51):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:51):
Any last words of wisdom on the world of podcasting? Starting a podcast? Continuing a podcast?

Chris Hutchins (01:01:57):
Yeah, I've got three things for you. One, this is a little bit of a financial outlay, but I think it's really interesting. There's this podcast app called Overcast, and it's not the biggest in the world, but you can run ads in it. And the thing I like is that the ads are much more reasonably priced than a lot of other places and they're very dynamic. So I would encourage anyone listening to watch it for a few weeks if you have a podcast and you want to experiment, because the same ad could be $200 one week and $700 the next week depending on how much demand there is for that category. So you can wait and hold out. But what I like is they take your art from your podcast and then you can rewrite your description and they tell you how many people saw the ad, how many people tapped on it, and how many people subscribed to the podcast after seeing the ad.

(01:02:43):
And technically they could also listen to the trailer, they could listen to an episode. And they even give you benchmarks of what to expect. So for a few hundred dollars, you could go in and run an ad for your podcast. Now, I would say in all of the experiments I've done with them, I've probably garnered... I'm looking at some numbers, like hundreds of subscribers, not thousands. And I've probably spent maybe a $1,000. The average cost to acquire a podcast listener, if you're doing paid marketing is about anywhere from three to $10 depending on the appeal of your show, what kind of audience? I'm sure it could go way over that for a business show. And by business I mean, B2B focused kind of show. So, let's call it $5. So it's not going to be the best way to grow your audience. At some point, if you're at enough scale that you have ads in your show and how much a customer's worth, maybe it makes sense to pay $5 because your LTV of a podcast listener is $7. But getting it started, that's not you.

(01:03:39):
What you can do is say, "Okay, what was my click-through rate on the ad?" Which will tell you if someone doesn't click, it's either not a good description or it's not a good set of content, or your cover art's not good. So you can think about, "Okay, I actually need to figure out the podcast before I even have content." And you could run this ad with a trailer before you even record anything. And then it's like, "Okay, well people tapped on it, how many of them subscribed?" And I like to use this as a way to say, "Okay, well the benchmark said I was going to get about 50 subscriptions for this ad that was going to get a thousand taps and I got seven." So these aren't people who weren't interested. These are people who read the description, were like, this is interesting, and they didn't subscribe.

(01:04:20):
That means my content probably sucks. That means someone listened to a trailer or an episode or something more than the description in the image and decided, "This is not for me." Maybe they looked at your episodes, I don't know. But if they don't tap on it, if you're supposed to get a 2% click-through rate and you get 0.5, then it's actually the topic or the way I describe it or the cover sucks. And so I like that as a way to, for a few hundred dollars, get a good test. I've even thought of running an AB test of the same podcast with two different descriptions. I wish you could do it with two different cover arts. So I don't know, that's like a cheap way to do a little bit of testing. One other thing that I'll share is I just try to share the podcast everywhere.

(01:05:05):
So you've probably noticed that in all of my emails at the bottom, it's like, "Oh, great, talk to you Chris." And then it says, "Hey, want to upgrade your life, money or travel? Check out my podcast and newsletter." I'm taking every opportunity I can to let anyone know about it because you never know it'll happen. And my favorite example, especially, when it's written that it doesn't come across a big bulky signature was we bought some floor mats and one of them didn't fit. And I was going back and forth with the customer service person and they actually replied and they were like, "Oh, thanks for sending me that podcast. I really appreciate it." They thought I was just randomly telling them, "Hey, if you want to upgrade your life, check this out." They didn't know it was my signature. So I got a new listener from customer service from a floor mat company. Which by the way, here's one hack that I also learned from the floor mat company.

(01:05:52):
Come to my show for hacks, but if you're ever trying to get a deal on something, that floor mat company, I just pulled up the live chat and just asked. And I said, "Hey, I'm looking at these floor mats, think you could give me a discount. It's a little expensive." And it was like, "Yeah, refresh your cart. It'll be 15% off." So, this episode's not about all the hacks, but there's one cool one.

Lenny (01:06:11):
We need more hacks. Wait, I think we'll get to that at the end. Keep going.

Chris Hutchins (01:06:14):
And then the last is, I think it's fun, that podcast you can experiment. I started out doing guests and then I did some Q&A episodes from questions listeners asked me, and then I recently did some solo episodes. I was really interested in the idea of all the ways you can rent and swap and exchange your home to stay in vacation homes around the world. So I just researched it for, I don't know, two or three days and just did a 45-minute episode of me talking. There was no guest, there were no questions, it was just me talking. And that works. I'm going to start another series of episodes where instead of interviewing people about an expertise topic, I'm going to interview people who are really dialed into a country. So I've got a guy who's written a handful of the Lonely Planet guidebook for Japan and is in Japan right now for three weeks getting dialed in, what are the latest, coolest stuff.

(01:07:03):
He's going to come back and we're just going to record an episode about everything you need to know about going to Japan. And I'm going to add on about 15 minutes I think at the end without him, where I just talk about all the tricks for using your points, your miles, deals and discounts. Like there's this new airline in LA that's super cheap to fly to Japan, but it comes with some caveats. So it'll be like two thirds guide to going to Japan, one third guide to getting there for cheap. And there aren't a lot of businesses or ideas where you could just have all of these things that you can experiment with.

Lenny (01:07:35):
And then you could do them so fast. Yeah,

Chris Hutchins (01:07:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:35):
I love that.

Chris Hutchins (01:07:37):
If I interview you, which I'm doing right after this, so anyone listening to this that wants to hear a little of Lenny's story, come check out All the Hacks. And for 20 minutes we talk about some topic that's a little off topic. I've sometimes just taken that it's submitted it as a bonus episode on Friday. 15, 20 minutes, it's not my regular show, but there's so many ways you can experiment and find out what you like. And then you might say, "Wow, you know what? I really like doing the solo things." Or maybe you have a co-host on for a week and you're like, "Ah, that's so much better."

(01:08:07):
So I just love that it gives you a good opportunity to experiment with stuff, find the thing you love, because I think my big takeaway is once you find the thing you really love to talk about, all of that, it just makes everything so much easier because it's natural and you would do it for free. And the harsh reality of this whole game is like there's probably going to be a number of months or years you have to do it for free before it takes off. So if you don't love it, that's going to be a painful few years.

Lenny (01:08:31):
To build on that, I find the same thing with a newsletter, same with a podcast. The last thing you want to do is create a job for yourself that you hate. And so picking a topic that is just not interesting to you, picking a medium that is painful to you, there's no reason to do that. You may become a TikTok star and you hit a viral video, but then you have to make viral videos for the rest of your life. That's no fun. You have to think about, "Do I want to do this for years and years and years." And you can stop, but then becomes hard if it becomes a really good source of income. So that's something to think about, just don't create a job for yourself that you just don't want.

Chris Hutchins (01:08:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:07):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I don't know if you knew this was coming. So it'll be extra special, real quick, easy, whatever comes to mind, let me know, and then we'll see how it all goes. Does that sound good?

Chris Hutchins (01:09:18):
That sounds good.

Lenny (01:09:19):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people recently or in life in general?

Chris Hutchins (01:09:26):
Two, I love. Actually, this could be three, Happy Money is a fantastic book. All about ways that you can spend your money to optimize for happiness. It's like a collection of a ton of research about the science of happier spending, so that's one. Vagabonding by Rolf Potts, who I had the pleasure... The last two I've had the pleasure of interviewing recently. It's like a guide to long-term travel, but it's just kind of a different perspective on travel. I would say if you're at the point in your life where you now have kids, it's probably going to be hard to live up to that. But I have gifted that book to so many people who are like, "Oh, I think I should take a trip for six months." I'm like, "Go read this book." My wife and I travel around the World for seven months, and that book was instrumental to us taking it and how we lived on that.

(01:10:09):
And then the last is called Die with Zero by Bill Perkins. And that book probably had the biggest impact. I haven't gifted it to anyone. I've recommended it heavily the last week because it had a huge impact on me. And the fundamental premise of the book is that, this isn't very lightning round response, but instead of optimizing for money, which is so tied up in American culture of how do I make more, how do I get promoted? How do I earn more money, how do I save more money? We should really be optimizing for the net fulfillment in life, and we shouldn't be trying to save all of this money. We should actually be trying to allocate it over our lives in the most optimal way to increase experiences, increase fulfillment, increase happiness. And sometimes that means saving less when you're younger and you're more able to do things like backpack around the world for seven months or go bungee jumping. And when you build those experiences early on, the memories of those experience pay dividends, the rest of your life.

Lenny (01:11:04):
Good choices. What's a favorite other podcast, other than your podcast and my podcast?

Chris Hutchins (01:11:10):
I love Animal Spirits. If you're into markets, life and investing. And they always have good recommendations at the end also on podcasts, TV shows, books, movies, that kind of stuff. So that's one I really like.

Lenny (01:11:23):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Chris Hutchins (01:11:28):
A show that I love, which I think is kind of like a version of a show called Silicon Valley, but not, it's called Mythic Quests on Apple TV. And I haven't heard enough people talking about this that I felt like maybe it's a hidden gem. Maybe I'm amongst company of watching this show, but I think it's a funny show. It's lighthearted, it makes me happy, and hopefully at least a few people haven't checked it out. But it's like a startup life show, but just dragged out to the extreme like Silicon Valley was.

Lenny (01:11:55):
What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask on your podcast?

Chris Hutchins (01:12:00):
I like to try to ask people about their favorite misconceptions in a space. Yeah, I like to kick things off usually with, "What's a thing that you kind of have a contrarian take on or you think most people get wrong about the thing that best?"

Lenny (01:12:13):
Awesome. Final question. What are your three favorite money hacks that listeners can take action on soon?

Chris Hutchins (01:12:23):
Okay. One that has paid dividends and literally, I've had people on a podcast telling them, write back to me, guests that are like, "I just saved money." So go to your state's unclaimed money website. Every state has one, and you can go put in your name, state or city, you don't even have to give your address. And you can find whether there are people that owe you money. And oftentimes they're businesses like you moved and Comcast couldn't figure out how to get you the final part of your prepaid month. And I had someone message me the other day and they're like, "I just listened to you talk about unclaimed money on a podcast, and I just found $136. I've never gotten paid to listen to a podcast." People have saved hundreds, some people, thousands. I always say, if you're going to dinner party, you now know someone's address.

(01:13:07):
You probably know their name instead of bringing a bottle of wine or in addition, just check if they have unclaimed money. I brought over to a bottle of wine to someone's house and said, "Also, by the way, did you know that this pharmaceutical company owes you $200?" And I showed him how to go claim it and boom, free money. What a great conversation for the dinner table. So that's one great one I love. Another great one, you can't use it right now unless you have a trip planned. But anytime you're booking a hotel book directly with the hotel and email the hotel in advance that, "Hey, we booked. We're really excited to stay with you." If you're celebrating something, let them know. And if you can't get the email address, just call the front desk, ask for an email address, follow up a couple days before you get there, let them know you're coming.

(01:13:51):
And I would say, you've got a 50% chance of getting an upgrade, getting a bottle of wine, getting some comped something, getting a better view. One person wrote into me letting me know that the hotel had their initials embroidered on their pillow, which I thought was kind of a crazy thing to have happen. It's never happened to me. Personally, I'd rather have the bottle of wine, but I'll take that for what it is. And for people who like the points game, I'll share something. Just give you a little tease of how I love finding all the points and miles optimizations. If you have a credit card that pays multiple points, three, four, or five x points on things like a grocery store or an office supply store, anything like that, drug stores, that's great. You probably don't have a card that pays any multiple of points on home improvements or Home Depot, Lowes.

(01:14:41):
So what I like to do to make sure I get the most points I can, instead of going to Home Depot and paying with a card that's going to give me one point per dollar at Home Depot. I have a four x grocery card. I like to go to Safeway and I just buy Home Depot gift cards. I get my four x points on the gift cards, then I go buy stuff at Home Depot knowing that I got four x points. But you also have some cards that give you three or four x points, if you go to CVS or other pharmacies or drug stores, you can do it there. You can do it at Office Supply stores if you want to take it to the next extreme. If you have an Amazon card, you could buy Amazon gift cards and get your five x or 5% back on the Amazon Prime card.

(01:15:20):
So I'm a little crazy like that. My favorite is if you're trying to buy something at a store, always shop online for coupons. If you Google like Lowes, Home Depot, Crate & Barrel coupons, there's all these websites. My favorite one is Save n, the letter, deals.com. You could buy Home Depot and Crate & Barrel coupons online for a couple bucks, save 15%. So stack up and then the cashback portals. I'm going to buy something, I'm like, "How do I get the cashback portal? How do I get the most points per dollar on my card? And how do I get a discount maybe from asking in the live chat or going in and buying a coupon." So I go a little crazy on that stuff, but I love saving money and just feeling like I got a good deal.

# The essence of product management | Christian Idiodi (SVPG)

## Transcript

Christian Idiodi (00:00:00):
I try to explain to people that the real essence of this job is that you wake up on behalf of someone else to solve a problem for them, and you have to do it well enough that they give you something back in return. That's kind of the real essence of it, and that's, I always call it a certificate of appreciation. And it could be in the form of revenue, engagement, loyalty, reference, all of those things. And that's the real essence of this job. If it's not fun, you're probably not doing it right. If it's not had, you're probably also not doing it right.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Today, my guest is Christian Idiodi. Christian is a partner at Silicon Valley Product Group, alongside Marty Cagan, who when he introduced us, called Christian the most interesting man in the world. After meeting him, I tend to agree. After a long career in product, Christian now spends his time working closely with companies, big and small, implementing and improving their discipline of product management. In our conversation, we discuss why the product management field is so often disliked and what you can do to avoid becoming a product manager people don't want on their team. We spend a lot of time on coaching, how to get better at coaching your reports, how to get better coaching from your manager, and some really clever tactics for building trust with leaders within your company. Also, Christian shares his one favorite go-to method, out of all of the discovery methods out there, for figuring out what to build.

(00:01:23):
Also, we spend some time on the great work that he's doing at Silicon Valley, Product Group. He's been doing a lot of great work on the product management field in Africa to help product builders and founders build great companies. That and so much more Christian is awesome. With that, I bring you Christian Idiodi, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:38):
You fell in love with building products for a reason. But sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

Christian Idiodi (00:04:03):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. It's a joy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:06):
It's a joy to have you here. So Marty Cagan introduced us, a colleague of yours at Silicon Valley Product Group. And the way he described you is he considers you the most interesting man in the world. Did you know that that's how he thinks about you?

Christian Idiodi (00:04:18):
I didn't. I consider him one of the most interesting people in the world too.

Lenny (00:04:22):
You guys are so kind to each other. I wanted to start with this trend I've been noticing in product management and the perception of product management. It feels like, I don't know if this is new or if it's always been around, but it feels like there's this trend of people just not liking product managers. There's trend of founders feeling like they should wait a long time to hire their first product manager. There's a lot of teams that wish they didn't have a product manager in their team. We don't have this person telling us what to do. I'm curious just why you think there's often this dislike of product managers. And then for PMs listening, do you have any advice for just how to not become a product manager people don't like and don't want on their team?

Christian Idiodi (00:04:59):
I think most people don't like product managers often because they haven't experienced good product managers. The core of product management is competency-based, meaning there is someone in an organization that represents the customer the best, that has a deep knowledge of the customers and your users, that has a deep knowledge of your data, your industry, your business and the product itself. And because of this competence, you kind of trust them to make decisions because if you have a problem that says, say we want more customers, it makes a lot of sense to go to the person that is an expert in customers to say, "Help me solve this problem." What you see happening in many organizations is that there is kind of this misperception displaced influence and mistrust because of the poor competency, meaning I feel I know more about the business or I know more about the customer or the data. And so why should I not tell you what to do?

(00:06:03):
And I think people fail to understand that this role is, it's a team spot. They are part of a team of people working together to discover a solution we're building and in a way that works for our company. And so I think when I think through the companies I've worked with, where I see this discipline really eroded is where there is just not a competent level of product management. The way I describe it to a CEO, I'll ask him, "Tell me who you trust in your company to make a decision on what markets we go to, what things we do." And they always have some senior leader, some VP, some person. And I say, "Why? Oh, Bob has been here a long time. He knows everybody. Everybody loves him and trusts him. He understands our business." And I often say to him, I say, "Well, Bob said put up manager." And it's often interesting to executives when I try to explain that way. I say that's the competent level that we're talking about here.

(00:07:01):
Imagine if you had Bob's on every team. Imagine how much you can accomplish. So one, I don't really think it's... I often say it's not the hate for product management, it's a hate for the understanding of what they have experienced in product management, which are people that are not able to deliver results that help them meet the outcomes they want.

(00:07:23):
So if I were advising product managers, I often say, look, when we see sales or executive driven product management where we see these alternatives to product management, it's not a cultural knock or a leadership knock, it's really on the individual and the discipline has to elevate itself to a place that it earns the right to make a decision on what we do.

Lenny (00:07:45):
I have exactly the same perspective. When people say they don't like product managers, exactly what I tell them is, you just haven't worked with a great product manager. A great PM makes everything easier for you. If you want to be a PM, people would hate to lose on their team. I would never want to lose Christian on my team as a PM. Is there something they could do maybe or change to become that person?

Christian Idiodi (00:08:06):
Well, I was just joking with someone earlier. I said, "I've only seen great product managers come out of two places. One, either a series of massive failure in their career or experiences that have been bad or from learning from great product leaders." The reality of this kind of role, it's kind of like if you have all kinds of... maybe you're like on a sport, like a quarterback on a team, you need to practice product management to be good at product management. You're not going to get mastery by avoiding some of these elements.

(00:08:39):
And we've kind of clearly defined what you need to represent to a company for them to trust you. So there is this period of humility that I challenge all product managers to have, this period of learning, recognizing what you do not know. And what you do not have is the trust of an organization or even in yourself that you know the customer, the business or the data better than anybody else. What you need to do is quickly try to accelerate that. You're going to find the loudest, most influential person in your organization, the person that everybody knows, knows everything, is in every meeting and stuff, and you're going to ask them to teach you. You're going to challenge them. And if they don't have the time to teach you, you're going to volunteer to help them. I'm going to intern for you. You're going to get permission from your manager and say, "Look, I want to spend time with Lenny. He's the head of sales, he's the head of operations and stuff. I just want to learn from him."

(00:09:35):
Now, what you're doing is you're extending that person's trust to yourself. You're also building a relationship with that person. But more importantly, you're learning what is driving that person's influence, which is their competence in the business or the customer.

(00:09:51):
After you've done that, you have to keep doing discovery because what's going to be different now is that person knows they've taught you everything that they know, but everybody now sees you learning every single day. So at some point, people will recognize that you might have more insights and more data than anybody else, and they will only know this because they've seen you learn from the best and they've seen you continuing to learn. So I always practically advise product managers in this kind of scenario, build relationships with people. You earn their trust by asking them to do two things. One, you're either going to teach me or I'm going to help you. And you're going to build relationships there, gain experience with them. You've got to immerse yourself in the deeper understanding of the business and the data.

Lenny (00:10:38):
Wow, there's a lot there. Because this is awesome. This is exactly, I think what people want to hear is how do you become better and how do you become more trusted and respected? So things you're recommending to PMs that want to become better, less disliked, more successful. I just took some notes as you were talking. One is there's a sense of becoming more full stack in the company, like understand the business, not just there's your one product and here's your one goal. And then this idea of just be always learning, which is both you are learning things and also people see that you're learning and see that you really care about a lot of the parts of the business that maybe you wouldn't naturally be inclined to understand. And that also helps you build relationships. And also just this really important point of if you know more than anyone else, people will innately trust you and respect you and want you on the team because you happen to have a lot of answers.

Christian Idiodi (00:11:25):
Yes.

Lenny (00:11:26):
Awesome. Kind of on a similar thread, something that Silicon Valley product group has is a really good definition of what a product manager's job is. And I thought it'd be cool just to spend a little time here. There's these four attributes you guys like to share. Can you just talk about that, as a little foundational?

Christian Idiodi (00:11:40):
I kind of mentioned before, a product manager is in a team spor., so they work as part of a team to uncover a solution, what to build. And every time you solve a problem, there's inherent risk involved. There's the risk of will people buy this or will they choose it or will they choose to use it, which is all a value type of risk. There's the risk of can they use it, which is a usability type of risk. The risk that we can build it to have the skills to build it or the time to build this, that's a feasibility risk.

(00:12:14):
And the risk of it working for our business, which is a viability risk. I cannot call out the product manager's competency. It's really to try to drive the first and the last one, which is value and viability. A solution worth building, something people will buy, choose or use, and one that works for our business, which is at the core of what product teams do, solve a problem in a way customers will love and a way that works for our business. It's why the product manager gets all the rap of, if everything goes great, a great team effort, if everything goes wrong, they blame the product manager.

(00:12:49):
It's because people hold them accountable to results. Nobody wants to work on something nobody wanted in the first place and your job is to ensure that we are working on something people want in the first place. And it is such an amazing role. I try to explain to people that the real essence of this job is that you wake up on behalf of someone else to solve a problem for them. And what an amazing job. There's just no greater... I cannot think of a better discipline with such inherent permission to solve problems on behalf of someone. And you have to do it well enough that they give you something back in return. That's the real essence of it, and that's the, I always call it a certificate of appreciation. And it could be in the form of revenue, engagement, loyalty, reference, all of those things. And that's the real essence of this job. If it's not fun, you're probably not doing it right. If it's not hard, you're probably also not doing it right.

Lenny (00:13:51):
Wow, I love that frame of reference of you're giving something to customers and your success is measured by do they give something back in return, which is basically do they pay for your product? Such a beautiful way to think about that. Oh, man.

(00:14:05):
Okay. So just to summarize these four elements, there's value, usability, viability, feasibility to understand if the product they're building hits all these attributes.

Christian Idiodi (00:14:15):
That's right. You're trying to uncover a solution and you know you've solved the problem when you get those two things, something customers love, they give you something back, and our business can support it in some ways. And I'm calling out, these are the different risks in our kind of taxonomy, how we call the things you have to tackle. And it's a team sport, and so there are these four risks of should we build it, will people use it, will people buy it, will our customers support it or our business support it? And you're trying to answer those questions with a designer and a product engineer.

Lenny (00:14:52):
Of these four, so value, usability, viability, feasibility, where do you think most new PMs fail most or should spend more time?

Christian Idiodi (00:15:00):
Oh my goodness, value. Value is probably, it is the most important and the most overlooked. And the big driver for that is often because of the operating model of teams. Teams are often given roadmaps of projects and features to go build and deliver. If that's the case, you actually really don't need a product manager because they're going to assume value. If the boss told me to build this, I cannot say, "Should we build this? Is this the right thing to build? Is there a better option? Is this what people will buy?" You just assume it's valuable.

(00:15:38):
And so often, when people ask me why does the product manager seem to play like a core leadership role on a team, almost like the quarterback. And it's not that they're more special in solving the problem that the designer or the engineer, but they're answering a question that determines if we should be working on this in the first place.

(00:15:57):
So value is often the hardest thing to solve and must be overlooked. We often see bad patterns where companies will say, "Yes, we ran a test, with 300 users and they all scored it 84% or 90%. They love it." In that way. I said, "Well, just because somebody can use your product doesn't mean that they will buy it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean they will choose it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean that they will actually use it." And what people say is often different from what they do. And our job is to actually solve the problem, which is what core value is, in a meaningful way. And often overlooked because we check the box on our own item. So the most important, because that's to the point of the certificate of appreciation, what you get in return, that's the ultimate outcome. Really, value.

Lenny (00:16:55):
You once gave a talk along these lines around discovery, and it was this talk of here's all of the things you can do to help understand what to build to make something valuable. There's a billion frameworks for every step of the discovery process, press releases, story mapping, opportunity solution, trees, fake door tests, all these things. And you're like, if we had to pick one thing, if there's one process or approach that you recommend most, your answer was essentially finding some number of reference customers to work with and helping them and working with them to design the product. Do you still see that as the one, if you had to pick one approach to figure out what to build? And if so, you just talk about how you recommend going about that.

Christian Idiodi (00:17:35):
The holy grail of product walk is really a reference customer. This is somebody that has used your solution or your product, loves it enough to tell people about it. I kind of described the work of the product team is to solve problems in a way that customers love and a way that works for our business. The ultimate definition for me today of the love that somebody has for our product is they're willing to put their reputation on the line by telling people about it. And for me, if we think about you do a lot of interviews with founders and entrepreneurs and you're going to have people that they find a market with an idea and they jump in. But if you think at the core of some of these founder-inspired businesses where the founder will say, "Well, I had a problem and it was their problem and they focused on solving the problem and then they got their friends on it."

(00:18:39):
And so it's almost like this idea that if they were their own first reference customer. They were so close to the problem, immersed in the environment of the problem, solved it in a compelling way enough where it was like, there are more people like me. And it is like if I said to you, "Lenny, let's go to a steakhouse. Find me a new steakhouse around you." You might go online and Google and you see a steakhouse with one review. How do you feel about that? I don't know. Maybe other people don't want to try this. You see two reviews, you're like, maybe it's the chef and their spouse or something. The question is how many positive reviews would you have to see to jump and say, "Let's go try this one." There are some things inherent in, if you look at Geoffrey Moore's adoption curve and those kinds of models in here, most people don't want to be the first to try things. But you are likely to try things if other people that look like you have accepted it or defined it as good.

(00:19:39):
And so the whole essence for me of this technique is to create those first people, those reference customers. If you think about how companies make the shift to becoming sales-led or operations-led, almost all companies start product-led. The product is first. You kind of build something and it's like, yeah, it's going, let's hire salespeople and marketing people and operational people to do it. What's really happening is that the product team created the first customers. And now a group of people have to capture the value that was created. So what's happening here is that it is constantly the job of product teams. The reason they lose influence is because salespeople are having to sell a product. You see? So they're like forcing back, "I need this and I need this." But if you came to me and said, "I want to buy steak," and I say, "Let me show you 20 people that look like you that recommend this steakhouse," my job as a salesperson is very easy. I'm just like, "Hey, you should eat here. Everybody that loves steak, they all eat here."

(00:20:44):
So product teams feel, at this contract to an organization when they don't create powerful reference customers. So it's by far my favorite technique. And the way this technique works is you want to discover and deliver and develop who has the problem, the customer. I want to discover who has the problem. At the same time, discover and deliver a solution to this problem. The idea here is that if you really want to solve a problem, you need to get out of your building. Go spend time with someone that has the problem and don't leave until you solve the problem. People talk about why we had such a record time to the Covid vaccine. Sure, technology has improved, our research has improved. But if you think about it, we had the highest number of volunteers for vaccination in the history of any vaccine in the history of time.

(00:21:36):
Why? Did we have to look for someone with Covid? No, they were literally all around us. The research was immersed in the environment of the problem. They could study... and so this is often what I call, it's almost like a pressure-cooked discovery in some ways. If you truly, truly want to solve a problem, get out of your building, get out of the assumptions, get out of your opinions. Immerse yourself, find someone who has the problem, stick with them until you discover a solution for this problem. And you're going to do that. The part of why I love this technique, the two biggest reasons I think, the first is if I cannot find a certain number of people that have this problem, my goodness, it might not be a problem, but solve it. I have never had a product failure using this technique. If I were to credit... goodness, I think last count, I'm up to like 205 products I have worked on or participated in creating in my career. And I tried to build a new product every year from scratch. It's kind of a crazy thing about me. My friends know what I want for my bad day is a problem worth solving. And I like to go from idea to revenue, and the setup, and I test all of these techniques in this way. And everybody knows my favorite technique is if we find a problem worth solving, we need to uncover a solution for B2B, I want six to eight references, for B2C, I want maybe 15 to 25 references as an indication that we've achieved product market fit.

Lenny (00:23:15):
Just to be clear, you said you still work, you build products yourself and you practice this and you've built... okay, what's like every recent product that you've built? I didn't know this.

Christian Idiodi (00:23:25):
So I do a lot of work in Africa now. WorkNigeria is like a job board that helps people. We do kind of a job board HR replacement and advisory too as well. I'm actually working on another app around the NDA and protecting high-asset individuals in some ways. So kind of every year, I find a problem like that worth solving and I practice doing the work of discovery with a team of people.

Lenny (00:23:54):
That's amazing. I see this unraveling of the most interesting man in the world is happening a little, bit by bit. We learn more and more about you. Okay, amazing. So just to kind of summarize some of these-

Lenny (00:24:03):
Okay, amazing. So just to summarize some of these points, which are really great and I've never heard it described this way before. So basically, a really effective way to understand how to build something people actually want and solve real problems is this idea of pick reference customers. And I really like this word reference, which is not just they're going to help you build a thing, but they're also become a reference to future customers because they end up loving it because you built it for them and they love it.

(00:24:27):
Your advice is find six to eight in B2B space, 15 to 25 in B2C. And the reason there's a number here is if you find just one or two, you never know, they might be just the one or two that have this really weird problem that no one else has. And I think that's usually the flaw in this approach is you end up building it for a small number of people and nobody else really wants it. And it sounds like in your experience, this is a good kind of number where probably a lot of more people will have this problem.

Christian Idiodi (00:24:53):
Yeah. There've been studies to validate some of these numbers. I think early, IBM, kind of struggled selling those supercomputers. And if you're buying a million dollar computer, someone says, "Hey, do you want to buy?" And you're like, "I don't know. Is there anybody else that has bought it? Shall I be the first?" And there was this common question of what would it take for you to buy it? And someone says, "Hey, if I see five or six people that look like me already have this, then I feel confident making the argument to my company, we should jump on it." And it's like, so how do I create the first five to six? And you can see a lot of the validation on B2C in some of the things you might see in the App Store on Yelp or those places. My idea here is if you found a steakhouse with 25 5-star reviews, you are likely to adopt this.

(00:25:41):
So in every app I have ever put on the App Store, on the day I launch the app in the app store, they are 25 5-star reviews. I will never launch an app and be like, "Let's hope Lenny loves it. Let's see who the first person." On the very first day of launching the app, there are 25... so I will know I am not ready until I have achieved 25 people that have told me, worked with me and said, "I am now ready to put my reputation the line." Sometimes I might need to work with 30 people or 50 people because the output is 25 reference customers. Because if Lenny is like, "I don't love it enough" or "I don't feel comfortable," I'm not going to customize for Lenny. I'm going to find my single target market, talk to more people. If I get 25, I have achieved product market fit.

Lenny (00:26:29):
So interesting. It basically kicks in this word of mouth flywheel that everyone's always looking for is how do I get people to talk about it. Build it for them, solve their problems, tell them that it exists. You mentioned a bit about how you understand if it's actually, let's call a product market fit, if you have product market fit with these people that you ask them if they're going to leave you a 5-star review for example. I guess what do you consider this is good, I got one more person that's really happy with this? What tells you it's got product market fit with a person?

Christian Idiodi (00:26:55):
If I were thinking about how I will do this, pick a problem to solve, first of all, I have to know who I'm solving the problem for. And in some indication and I want to validate that this is actually a problem you do have. And I'm looking for a certain type of person. These early adopters in our world are broken up to technologists and evangelists. Technologists could be, "I love the new iPhone 16 is coming out and it's going to have five cameras and I write an article in some tech review board. Super fast, super sleek, all good design." You just love new technology. You always jump on new technology. And evangelist could be someone that says, "Oh my, I look great with the iPhone 15, it has three cameras. I will look phenomenal with the iPhone 16, so I'm going to go stand in line at the Apple Store for three hours or overnight because I just can't wait to get my hands on the Apple 16."

(00:27:53):
They may feel a little irrational, but those are the kind of people you're looking for, people that believe they have a problem. So it's like you will try any steakhouse, in my example. You're just like, "I love steak. I don't care if there are reviews or not. I'll try it." And what I'm trying to do here is I'm saying, okay, Lenny loves steak, he wants to try a steakhouse. And I'm good to say, "Lenny, I'm trying to build the best steakhouse here. If I create a menu that you absolutely love, are you willing to tell people about it?" That could be a video testimonial, write a review, stuff like that. And it's okay Lenny, if you don't love the first iteration of it and stuff like that, I want to hear your feedback. I want you to work with me in ensuring that I build the best steakhouse here. And that's kind of the idea.

(00:28:37):
So I'm going to work with 25 people that look like you and I'm going to keep tweaking, in this sense iterating on the product and the menu until Lenny's like, "My goodness, this is the best steakhouse in the world." It is like I'm just going to write about it and when I get 25 people that have all, it's not the steakhouse, they love it enough. Because this is where you really get the shift in value. Because if I say, "Lenny, go write me a review, a five-star review." You're like, "I don't know if I feel comfortable about." You say, "Why not?" You see, I'm really going to get deeper feedback because people will say or do anything just to avoid hurting our feelings or for us to get out of their face. So they'll be like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll give you a five-star review." But when I say do it, you're like, "Well, I have this hesitation." Why? That's really where great discovery comes. But it's hard to in a silo. You have to be immersed with the person that has the problem. So product market fit is when you iterate it in this discovery, you've discovered and delivered something so meaningful that these customers that are your target customers, are willing to put their reputation on the line and be a reference. That's my indication.

Lenny (00:29:49):
I imagine though, Christian, so charismatic, comes to me and says, "Hey Lenny, would you leave me a five star review for this product. I'm working on this, I'm trying to figure out if people want it." I would be like, "Yeah, of course. I'll leave you a five-star review." What do you do to kind of avoid that, just like I just want to be nice, like I don't care, I'll leave a five-star review.

Christian Idiodi (00:30:06):
You. It's part of why I need 25 in B2C. And don't get me wrong, if I can convince 25 people in there, I may have a marketing product and a charismatic marketing products. If that's all I needed to do was a good message and charisma to get people on it. The good benefits of this is that you can tackle risk very early because you can involve many other parts of your organization, marketing, sales, legal, finance. People often ask me how do I come up with the marketing spiel or the description? I'm like, "I don't make that up." If I ask Lenny, "What do you feel about this product?" And he says, "Well, it's cool and it's very sleek and very nice." The marketing department will say, "We don't like those terms. We want to call it comprehensive." And when you go out to sell your product, people are going to be disappointed because the expectations are created by what's on the box.

(00:31:04):
I only market exactly what customers tell me. I have never been surprised about what customers will say when I release a product because in this technique I already get their feedback. And so I'm going to put exactly what Lenny said on the box. "Hey, this product's cool and sleek and easy to use." I've only launched a product that says super fast but difficult to read because the technology team said there was no way to change the font on something and it was just going to be difficult to read. And you know what everybody did when they got the product? "Oh my goodness, it is super [inaudible 00:31:39]. All right, it is also difficult to read." It matched their expectations in some ways. So what I do here is I learn how to sell the product with this technique, I learn how to market the product because I have real people, that we're not making assumptions.

(00:31:54):
What's the best way to market this? How much Lenny? How would you find this? Does this language resonate with you? Does this properly describe the menu? See? So that's kind of what you're doing when you use a technique like this. It feels heavy to people, but that's kind of part of the practice of it. If you do this a whole lot, you get really comfortable at involving, you're working with your customers to solve it. But for me, the fact that you will not have a product failure because you have a natural pivot out, meaning if I can't find 25 people that love steak, why in the world am I building a steakhouse? So if you don't find enough people that love this problem and are willing to help you, just be like, this is not a problem worth solving. But more importantly, you really start to get... is the fastest part to product market fit, the clearest definition for me because I know when my product is ready, when I've dotted those I's and crossed those T's, in that way.

Lenny (00:32:49):
I think your point there, recruiting is itself a huge signal, is really important. Can you find people that have this problem and care enough about this problem that they're going to talk to you and spend time exploring this thing that doesn't exist yet. I think that's super interesting. And then I think another key part of this is it's one solution that solves many people's problems. And it can't be a bunch of different things for a bunch of different people.

Christian Idiodi (00:33:10):
That's right, that's right. If one person says, "I don't want this," wants this, another person wants this, you don't do it. That's how you know you do the minimum. All 25 have to want the same thing. If one person's out, you just don't do it at all. And the reason that's powerful is because if I come to you and I say, "Hey, it's missing this feature." I say, "Well yeah, 25 people that look like you that are very happy without it." You see? That's how if you think about what you do in a review, you see the five stars and you instantly like, "Oh, that's good enough." But if you have a question, what do you do, you cannot double click on the review to read. And that's how people get convinced. There's this social influence of like, "Well, Lenny's cool, he likes the steakhouse. I should like it. He's fine with this not being there so I should be fine with it." So your references are super powerful in more than any company, in influencing consumers on what they should choose or not choose.

Lenny (00:34:06):
Basically, Strive builds new products exactly this way. They find new customers that have a problem and they work with very small number of customers to build a product for them, and that's how a lot of their new product... I think Rippling works like this too. So I think this is a really good lesson for everyone listening, if they're trying to build something new. Is there an example that comes to mind that would be, I don't know, interesting to talk through, of something you built that you worked through this process?

Christian Idiodi (00:34:30):
Oh, boy. I tell the example of solving a problem when I was at a staffing company, a snag job. They do hourly jobs and help people find their best job or an hourly job and I actually get a call here from the head of Global staffing at Starbucks. Now, he called me, you can see the benefit of this technique, because I'm the person he calls when he has problems. I've used this technique with him at a previous company. He didn't even know I was at a new company. And he calls me up and he says, "Christian, I have a problem." I said, "Well, don't we all have problems?" He said, well, "We just bought a bakery in the San Francisco Bay Area. And as we're doing the paperwork to kind of take over this company or this acquisition, we realized that close to 800 of the employees may be undocumented workers."

(00:35:22):
And I said, "Wow, that does sound like a problem." He's like, "Yeah, imagine if this breaks out in the news and all of that. But more importantly, we still need to get all their paperwork. So all these people are going to quit and we'll have a new bakery without employees." And my first question to him as a product guy is like, "Wow, would you give me a million dollars to solve this problem?" And it's like, "No, seriously?" I was like, "300,000." I'm throwing out numbers. He's like, "Maybe." I said, "Wow, you have my attention." I go to my CEO, I tell him to call. I grab a designer and an engineer. I just say, "Hey look, I would love to work on a little project with you all if you have some time." I kind of debrief them on the call. Now the first thing I have to do is to try to define the problem, identify problems. What really is the problem going on?

(00:36:08):
Yeah, we're breaking it down, we're talking through this. We say, well, at the end of the day, Starbucks needs to hire like 800 people quickly because we can't fix getting everybody's paperwork. But they're going to lose these people and they need to hire those quickly. And I say, well, who else has this problem? We're trying to throw out guesses. I'm like, "What are we talking about? Let's go out." Everybody jumps in my car and we start driving around and this is where we're doing our product work from. We're talking in the car, just out of the building. We see a new construction site for a new McDonald's coming soon and we're curious. We're like, well, "Let's go find out." We start talking to people on sites. Fortunately, the operations director is on site and we ask him, we say, tell us about opening up a new McDonald's.

(00:36:54):
He says, "Well, do you know we need like 120 people on opening day?" We're like, "Whoa, for McDonald's? Really, 120 people?" He's like, "Yeah, do you know that most of the people in this industry don't show up to work on the very first day, and every day we're in construction, we're losing money. So the second the bathrooms, the restrooms, are done, we want to open up." We're like, "Wow, we didn't think about this, new construction, a new store opening." They need to hire lots of people quickly. So I said, "Thank you very much." I gave him my business card, he gave me his. We jumped back in the car. We just kept driving. We went to the mall. We started talking to people there. We talked to a manager at Macy's and she said, "Oh look, we hire 20,000 people in the holiday season."

(00:37:36):
We're like, "Macy's." Yeah, it's like nights, weekend, shipping, stuff like this. We started hiring in the summer because of how painful it is. Now, all we're doing here is just validating that this is a real problem, like other people will have the problem. So we go back to the office, we're brainstorming, like, "How will someone even go about solving this problem?" We're thinking this was like, we're not really sure, but McDonald's guy was very desperate. I said, " I have his business card." We start throwing some ideas. So I called the McDonald's person and I said, "Look, you just met with us." He's like, "Yeah. We would love to help you solve the problem." He said, "Well, what do you have in mind?" I said, "We've been talking. What if we just sent you some people to interview. And if you like them, you'll hire them."

(00:38:18):
He said, "That seems fairly easy." He's like, "How do I pay for this?" And we took a swag like, "Maybe you pay us for everybody that you hire." He was like, "Oh, I don't see much risk to that. This is great." I'm like, "Oh, okay." We have no sense of what to do. We are literally Googling, how do people find a job at McDonald's? We go to colleges, we are sticking up flyers. We are putting ads in the newspaper back then, we are looking at different techniques to try to get people into a funnel and interest by posting on Craigslist or things like that. At the end of the week, we get about 40 people that are interested to come to the interview. We're like, that feels good for our first try. We call the manager up and we say, "Look, on Monday we will send you 40 people to interview. This is great."

(00:39:05):
Monday I take my designer, my engineer, we are on site with the manager. At nine o'clock, we expect three people to show up for interviews. Nobody shows up. 10 o'clock, another three, one person shows up. We got to the end of the day, less than 20 people show up. This man only has four or five people. We are like, "We suck this. This is terrible." We go to the manager, " Let's go and apologize for wasting your day and stuff." He starts to laugh. We're like, "What's going on?" He said, "Look, I forgot to tell you. Folks in this industry don't even show up to interviews. We are McDonald's, we pay minimum wage. People will leave us for 25 more cents an hour. They will leave us for a job that is one block closer to their house or less than a mile closer to their home."

(00:39:54):
Now, the engineer is with us and he's thinking about it. It's like, this is really interesting. About half of the people showed up. He hired one in five. If you really want to solve this problem, playing the laws of averages, we probably need to send this man close to 200 people. We need to go bigger. So we are storming the office, we called the McDonald's guy again. I was like, "Can we try again next Monday?" And he's like, "Do I only pay for the people I hire?" We're like, "Sure." It's like, "Oh, go ahead and kill yourself on this." It's a pain. We've been trying all kinds of things for years.

(00:40:26):
Now, we start doubling down our efforts. We start calling back all the people that didn't show up for interviews like, "What's going on? Did you get lost? Don't you want a job? What's wrong with you?" We start figuring out what portals worked well for us the last time, what wasted our money, what was the cost to acquire a person. And we spend a week doubling our efforts on those channels. We probably have about 120, 130 people on the list. The Sunday beforehand, we start calling them up like, "Please show up. Don't embarrass us. Don't you want the job? Do you need that address? Should I call you a reminder, set your alarm." We're trying all the techniques to try to get more people. There we go the next day and at the end of the day he has about forty-five to 50 people. He comes to us, he shakes our hand. He's like, "Whoa, the quality was excellent. All my recruiters were engaged. The day was smooth," [inaudible 00:41:17] how successful we are.

(00:41:18):
He's like, "I want to use you for every new McDonald's I open in the area." Now, I don't know I have a product. I just know I was able to help one person at McDonald's. But I feel like I have enough learning. So I called up my friend at Starbucks and I said, "Hey, man, remember the problem we talked the about?" He's like, "Yeah. I would love to help you solve it." He said, "Oh, okay. What do you have in mind?" I said, "Well, I think we need to send you about 3000 people to interview." He said, "3000 people? I told you I only need 800." I said, in this industry, most people don't show up for interviews, right? He said, "Oh my goodness. You know our industry well. I like this. I'm going to take this up, I think we'll give you this contract." I take my designer, my engineer, we go to San Francisco. We're out there recruiting because this is where it was based. We have to get a whole hotel, hire people. We are working all the channels we knew, working in the area. Remember, we don't have any software, no technology. The designer, we're doing this manually, Excel spreadsheets, phones, emails, in that way. In one week, Starbucks hired 784 people. I get an email the next Monday morning from the contact at Starbucks. He copied Howard Schultz, then CEO of Starbucks. The email read, "These guys just saved our butts." I sent it to my CEO, but then I said, "You know what?" I only know now I can help on McDonald's and a Starbucks, but that doesn't mean I have a product. But I now have enough of problem definition. I reached out to the head of marketing, the head of sales. I said, "Tell us who has this problem you've come across," because we need to work with more people to try to uncover a solution that is scalable, maintainable, reliable, and works for our business. Weirdly enough, the next opportunity we had was the Los Angeles International Airport. They were opening up a new terminal and they said, "We need 200 people to manage all the stores in the new terminal." And we were like, "200 people? We just hired close to 800. We got this." We go to LA for the briefing with the staffing group and they tell us the people that work at an international airport have to match the demographics of the travelers. We say, "Say what? Yeah, we have 13% Chinese-speaking travelers, we need 13% Chinese-speaking employees." We say, "Sorry? We've got 5% Korean speaking." I mean my team is in LA, we're in Chinatown. We are speaking, trying to recruit people to come and work in an airport. If we expect 10 people to show up, only one person shows up.

(00:43:49):
We start calling job seekers up like, "What's going on?" They say, "Do you know what it means to work at an airport?" First, I wake up at five o'clock, I drive to the employee parking lot. I get into a bus. Then I go through security. There was not like TSA pre-check back then. Then if I want to break, I go to security again and then you pay me minimum wage. It took us close to three months to staff this. We had to negotiate with the union to raise the price to like $15 an hour to attract people. When we come back from that, you know what we're saying, that is not our customer. Never again. We are never doing airports. That's a pain.

(00:44:24):
Around this time, it was the holiday season, so we reached out to the person at Macy's. We told them about our work with McDonald's. They say, "Oh, we'll try this." We started working with them. You can imagine through this, the engineer is thinking, how can I use technology to improve this? I always tell this to people, I never wrote a requirements document, I never wrote a story. So the designer is thinking, how can we improve the end-to-end experience? Okay, we need a recruiter experience, a job seeker experience. We had a funnel. We need to build a scheduling tool so that they can scale the interview. Oh, what about notification? Maybe text message. We can send them a map so that they can know how to get to the... I mean, all of these things, because they were involved from the very beginning in defining the problem, they were immersed in the solution to the problem. It takes us about eight and a half, almost nine months to build this. When we launched this product in its first 90 days, it booked $32 million in sales.

(00:45:22):
Why? Because you got McDonald's probably until today using this product to open up every new store. Well, Starbucks went to the global contract. We say, " Well, we've only done discovery in the US so I only know where it works in this market." And we started finding, if you look at NASCAR, some of these big sporting events, they have to bring a lot of people together very quickly for a short amount of time. And this is the same kind of product they use to do that high volume hiring in a short amount of time. If you think about it, I was discovering who had the problem and developing the customers that have the problem. At the same time, I was discovering and delivering a solution to that problem.

Lenny (00:46:01):
That's insane. You said you made thirty-something million dollars the first year of launching this thing.

Christian Idiodi (00:46:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:46:06):
That's unreal. I love how this is the epitome of doing things that don't scale. You going hiring McDonald's employees and then Starbucks employees.

Christian Idiodi (00:46:15):
That's right.

Lenny (00:46:16):
Then airport employees. Wow.

Christian Idiodi (00:46:18):
You do things that don't scale and then you do things that do scale. And it's so powerful when you discover how to do things that don't scale, when you actually know. Because it's the power of technology is just the beauty of what it can do at scale.

Lenny (00:46:34):
And to that point, it's easier said... a lot of people talk about doing things that don't scale. Many people don't actually do anything like that. They're like, "Nah, let someone else figure that out, or let's just actually think about the future of this versus just doing it and solving and finding problems." I love that also, you didn't do any of these other, the things we talked about. There's no fake door test, there's no opportunity solution trees. There's no user interview. You're talking to people. It wasn't like a user research interview, come sit down, ask questions.

Christian Idiodi (00:47:00):
I said, there's nothing better in learning how to solve a problem than trying to solve the problem. You will get all the answers, the research, the failure, the mistakes, all the evidence. You know the difference between what people say, this is what they do. You'll validate and test. Because at the end of the day, what is statistically relevant? Solving the problem is the clearest indication that we've solved the problem and that we know how to solve the problem then. And so yeah, very powerful technique.

Lenny (00:47:30):
And I love that you didn't really know exactly where this was going to lead. It was just kind of this exploratory, let's see if there's something here. And you just kept following this like, huh, there's a problem. It looks like we found a way to solve it. Let's just see where else this can take us. Amazing.

(00:48:34):
I want to shift to a different topic. You spend a lot of time helping product leaders get better at coaching, get better at building relationships, get better at building trust with their teammates. Marty Cagan actually shared this quote with me when he joined, he said that you can build trust with executives and product leaders faster than anyone else he knows, and the people you coach adore him like some kind of rock star.

(00:48:57):
He's literally on speed dial for several of the CEOs of the largest companies in the world. Okay, so let me just ask you, what's your secret to being a great coach, and how can people listening become better coaches to their reports, maybe colleagues?

Christian Idiodi (00:49:12):
This topic is probably near and dear to my heart because, I mean, there are many ways that I think our corporate structures have failed in creating high performance and stability in people, and I think one of them is actually encro of leadership. And by leadership, the key component I often point to is coaching. This idea of what truly is the job of a leader. And I tell people, yeah, it's context and culture at the highest level like, why are we here? Where are we going? How do we organize ourselves to get there? What's important?

(00:49:51):
Just kinds of things and the environment in which we do it, but there's a people element because you recognize that you want an outcome and you need people working together to that outcome. So I now have to staff those people and I have to hire and train them and equip them and then appoint them to what those things are. But many of those things are one-off, meaning I create a vision, I create a strategy. I hire a person. There's something that is every day and that's coaching, that's like the day job of managers. And if I think about high performing teams in the world, and you can pick sports is one of those, artists, they have coaches and managers like it's an everyday thing. And the idea is that when I explain this to people, I say doing product management is a product manager's job, but getting better at product management is the manager's job, is the coach's job. And people tend to misunderstand how that dynamic works.

(00:50:57):
You see, if you are playing a game, you're in the game. The coaches are on the sideline watching you play the game and getting you better at playing the game. Your job may be to kick or pass the ball and you need a competence level, but somebody's job is every day looking for ways for you to be better at your job.

(00:51:16):
The number one reason most people don't give good coaching is because they've never experienced good coaching themselves. And most people can only give to other people what has been given to them, what experiences they've seen. I was in an executive meeting with a CEO and he gets up in a meeting and he just starts screaming and cursing at everybody, just throwing up And I said, "Whoa, whoa." I said, "Can we talk outside?" They pick him outside. I was like, "First of all, I don't even think I can work with you anymore given this environment you're creating, but I need to understand why you are talking to your team like that." And he says to me, he says, "Christian, well my boss used to scream at me like this. And look at me, I'm now a CEO, I got it, I understand it. They are grownups, they can understand it too."

(00:52:05):
And I said, "Well, tell me what you're trying to communicate." And he explains it to me and stuff and I said, "Is it okay if I show you an alternative way of communicating that?" He says, "What do you mean?" I said, "Well is it first of all safe for me to do this with the team?" So I go back to the team and I say, "Look, I'm going to try to say what the CEO was trying to say again. He's giving me permission for you to speak freely and candidly, I want your honest opinion as to what was more effective and why." And I took a stab at kind of representing what he was trying to say and I asked the team and it's like, yeah, it's the same thing kind of message, but when he tells us this stuff we just go do it. We get it, we go do it. But the way you described it right now to us, I can think of four other things I need to do. I even understand some other things that may be missing that we need to now go tackle.

(00:52:57):
And the CEO is kind of really taken aback and it's kind of in some ways he has never seen an alternative. And he's never seen if an alternative be effective. Most people need to see something then they need to do it before they can even teach it, in some ways. Now I'm saying this all because I need to make a very strong argument for people understanding coaching. And in some ways I probably did not know that I was probably good at coaching. I coached my kids in soccer for eight years and we always won the championship, my boys team and I had long waiting list of people and I thought I had a fundamental flaw in understanding it because when my kids were all four years old, when you have the kids run around the soccer field just kicking the ball any way, my team always had plays, they all have strategy.

(00:53:49):
So winning games like 10 to zero, other kids, I thought I'm like, maybe I was born in another country. I didn't know you were just meant to let them play. And I was really coaching kids and I was treating four-year-olds like adults. We're watching video, watching tape, having real... [inaudible 00:54:05] But it was so funny when you see them execute on the field. But I've kind of always had this mentality about the truest forms like companies cannot care for people, people care for people. And the representation of what is acceptable in an environment or what we do is by the leaders. Now there's some different dynamic to why that's not happening with how we promote people and the whole poor structure around that. But fundamentally, trust is a key part of doing this. And I think when I tell these people, I say, "Look, most people don't know that you know something until they test you."

(00:54:50):
We do it a whole lot in our environment. I ask you a question, I see how you answer and it's like I might ask you what's one plus one? It's two and now I know that one plus one is two. I don't care when you learned it. I need you to know that it's two to do my work. So it happens in everyday environment and what people fail to do is to do the learning so they get the question wrong and they lose trust. And trust is based on competence and character, there are other values like communication and concern and care, but most corporate environments, it's a competency thing. That's why you see so many companies accept people with bad communication, bad care, because they're very good at their job. So if you can demonstrate competence, you will earn some trust, at least the trust of competence from people.

(00:55:44):
So I kind of explained to people a whole lot that the real core of their job at first is to learn, to seek to understand before they are understood, to know what you don't know. That humility and ego only last a small minute. The most powerful way I have found to get trust with many people is to have them accountable for an outcome of mine, which is to know. So if I wanted to accelerate trust with Lenny, I will ask Lenny to teach me. And I see this like an emotional intelligence, black belt technique here, but many environments, if you get into environment, it's very quickly for you to identify the power in that environment. Who is influential? Who has loudest voice and all? And there's something behind why they're powerful. Yes it is title, but if you think about why someone is called a CEO, it's because there's some competence that made someone give them the title, they are great at growing businesses, they have a good stride, whatever it is.

(00:56:51):
So what you do to build trust is you want that person to trust you. Okay. But the only way that person will know that they trust you is if they test you. And unfortunately many environments they do that publicly. I'm in a meeting, I ask Lenny a question. He bumps a presentation like, oh, product managers are useless. That person doesn't know anything. So here's what I do when I want to build trust, if Lenny's a new hire in my company, I take Lenny to the loudest, most influential person in the company. And I say, "Look, I just hired Lenny. Super rockstar, did all of this. But he knows nothing about that business, nothing about how we work and stuff. I will love for you to teach him some things." Now he may be like, "I'm super busy, I'm involved."

(00:57:36):
I say, "Look, Lenny should just hang with you. I've played his calendar for the whole week. He's just got to sit in meetings you are, quiet, observe, just by observing you, he will be a rockstar. No stress, nothing to give." Now it's impossible for this leader to sit with you for a whole week without saying things like, "So Lenny, where are you from? What do you do? Tell me about yourself." What have I now done? I forced a relationship between a very powerful, trustworthy, influential person and somebody else that doesn't have it. If you are walking around the company with this person, what is everybody going to say? Oh my goodness, you're friends with that person. I want to know Lenny because we can never get him to agree on it. So if I know Lenny, I'll be close with it. Lenny is more accessible, he's new, but how did Lenny break in? I'm extending somebody else's trust to you. Now by also making that person share in the accountability of training you or teaching you, in some ways, I am now making them accountable for your growth. It's impossible two months from now for that person to say, "Oh, Lenny doesn't do anything." Why? Because it makes them a bad teacher. So they're always going to be friendly, be like, "Oh yeah, Lenny, let's have a conversation. Don't do it like this in this way." They will prep you because it makes them look bad if you're not competent. Now, this technique accelerates relationships and trust. It's the help me teach me type of technique. It also allows them to observe the dynamics within the company, but it accelerates relationships because it's impossible for you to be in a meeting with a leader all the time without the person saying something like, "Oh yeah, hey folks, let me introduce you to Lenny."

(00:59:20):
Now that person is now the one introducing you to more connections within the company. Fastest way to build is, now feels like it's a expense but this is the job of a coach. You are designing a very specific playbook to help people achieve the outcomes reward and that's by getting them competent at their job and then their potential where they need to go next.

Lenny (00:59:45):
That are some Jedi ninja tricks right there. I love that. I've never heard this advice before. Makes so much sense and it's so easy to implement.

Christian Idiodi (00:59:54):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:59:54):
Amazing. For someone that maybe doesn't have a Christian around as a coach or a manager that isn't at this level, what advice do you give people that are looking for a coach or someone that could help them along these lines to learn to build trust and learn to just generally improve?

Christian Idiodi (01:00:09):
Boy, like I say with everything, you don't get mastery by avoidance. And one of the things that good coaches do that when I say corporations fail companies is they don't create space for practice. I see people complain to me about people all the time, oh this person is not good. They presented this, it was terrible. And I ask them, "What did they do at practice?" They say, "What do you mean?" I say, "When they were practicing this, what did they do?" Say, "Well, they didn't practice. I told them to prepare this." I say, "Think about what happens at practice. Any practice of any sport, any game. You can stop. You can make corrections, you can give feedback. What you do at practice, you do in the game. Product management is a one time, game time kind of role. So when do people practice?"

(01:00:57):
And so what I tell people in the absence of getting good coaching, you need to find practice arenas. It's kind of like if you are learning a new sport or basketball, you kind go to the gym. It's a practice arena. You can play and shoot around and let maybe some people have pickup games that you join and stuff like this in some ways. And so I always advise product managers like, you need to join a lot of pickup games, which they are low barriers to entry, low evaluation reward, loan risk type of thing. Go volunteer at a non-profit working with the team, go volunteer in your community event or church or whatever you go to, go party. But now what am I trying to do with these things? Find places where people do collaborative problem solving. That is what you're doing as a product team.

(01:01:50):
It's more likely in a high performance environment you'll find a good coach. You'll find somebody out there but what you're also doing is you're observing other people play. Most people learn a lot of skills by, you watch TV like, oh I like that move. And then you go to the gym and you practice that move, you see what you do? So it's like you're seeing then you're doing it in some ways. So you need to see good product work so that you can do good product work so that you can teach good product work. So if you don't have the benefit of having a good coach directly, you've got to find environments where you see good coaching happening and a good indication of good coaching is actually good outcomes over and over again. Winning teams, winning performances, great products, great products come from great product teams. They probably have good leaders or a good leader within a bad culture.

Lenny (01:02:45):
So essentially it's get a bunch of reps in is a big part of this advice. Just get reps in and I think what you just said is such an important part of it is collaborative problem solving is the key thing to look for. I was going to ask you how you recommend people get into product management. I imagine this is a very similar answer, it's just find opportunities to collaboratively problem solve.

Christian Idiodi (01:03:04):
That's right. And I differentiate that because there are all those guys that are the, I know I like to change a light bulb or they can walk individually or thinker and stuff and I kind of differentiate that problem solving from the people that are very good at working with other people to solve a problem. And there are so many of those pockets, you're getting reps. You've heard those who that just tell you stories of them working problem and I can see how they will help me. They know how to use data, they know how to use insights. They're not afraid of talking to people. How are you going to get those reps? Because you come into my company I ask you a question like, oh, I really don't know where do I find? But if you've done the problem solve with a team, sometimes you may not even know how to get the answer, but you know who to go to get the answer. That's a gift too.

Lenny (01:03:52):
I love that so much of your advice comes back to being the person that knows the most or has learned the most or even looking like they're spending the time to learn the most, which makes so much sense. The people you want to entrust are the people that happen to have the answers.

Christian Idiodi (01:04:05):
I try.

Lenny (01:04:06):
And each person will know. Yeah, it just makes sense. Something else you talk about is people getting promoted too early. Leaders getting promoted too early, not doing well, they end up blaming others when really they were not actually ready for this new position. Can you talk about why you think that happens and then just how maybe as that person that might be in that position right now feeling like, oh, shit, maybe it's not my fault.

Christian Idiodi (01:04:31):
I don't know how to make an appeal to corporations on this one. It's a similar appeal in the light of coaching too as well. Most people are promoted to a point of incompetency or so, but I kind describe the dynamic this way. It's kind of like Lenny is a fantastic engineer. If you think about it, he wins engineer of the year awards. If you go to the office, his picture is on the wall, everybody knows him. He's feeling good. But it's like one year, two years, maybe eight years in Lenny's feeling like, am I really growing in my career? Am I really challenged in my career? He looks at the engineering career ladder. The next role from his senior engineer role is engineering manager. The leadership team, HR, they look at the same thing. That's true. We love Lenny. We don't want to lose Lenny, we need to promote him.

(01:05:20):
And the next step is engineering manager or product manager, manager, however, I want to use the rule here. And so, we do what? We promote Lenny. It feels good at the moment. Yeah! Congratulations on your promotion. He posts a nice post. We are like, "Yeah, we're going to keep Lenny there for long time now because he's promoted." Now, Lenny has never been a manager in his whole life. He's never interviewed people, fired people, didn't even coach people or had done any of those things directly. After a couple of months, Lenny starts to recognize an interesting pattern. Nobody's clapping for him at company meetings anymore. And sure they've taken down his picture from the world because he's no longer an engineer, he's a manager. So somebody else is now the engineer of the year, they are clapping for him in meetings. He's like, he doesn't feel recognized or seen anymore. He's just a guy now behind the scenes and that kind of thing.

(01:06:10):
Then in a couple of weeks go by, then they have a big engineering problem. And you know what Lenny does? He jumps in and he solves the problem. Lenny did not recognize that his job has changed. His job is no longer to solve the problem directly, but to get a team of other people good at solving problems. This is because you're a great engineer but not a good manager. This story or this dynamic I've told is probably the most common origin story of what people see or deem as micromanagement. In many cases here, this individual knows how to do engineering. They don't know how to do engineering management. They don't see the shift in their dynamic being changed. We see back patterns where it's like the second you become a manager or a leader, you cannot say things like, I don't know. I'm not sure, I need help. Who told us those things? But it's like such an expectation that our leaders must have the answers, must know the right things, must do the right things.

(01:07:17):
And so what do we see people do? Rather than Lenny asks for help, he goes to Google and searches how to do an interview, how to write a review. Are you seeing? He reads different articles like this one looks cool and then he does it and nobody dies. Nothing breaks so he thinks there's a good framework and a good pattern. And we have this dysfunctional culture of everybody doing different things, whatever works for anybody and that is the cycle that repeats itself. Now, a person that works for Lenny sees that he used this framework and thinks it must be a good framework, my boss did it, and you see how that cycle repeats itself? Because Lenny didn't actually get coached to be a manager. If you ask anybody that works with me, if come to me and say, "Oh, I need to get promoted to be a director." You know what I say? I say, "Go be a director. You don't need a title. Let me tell you what a director does. And you're going to work with me over the next couple of months to do those things because I am promoting you to do the job, not to learn the job." You see where it falls apart in promotions? We promote people and it's like you're now a VP, do VP things. And you're like, I have never done VP things before, but I cannot tell people I've never done VP things because it makes me look incompetent, but I see the job description. I should do some VP things. What did my last VP do? Those things and those. How you say? But the best place to learn how to be a VP is when you're not a VP because that's where you practice being a VP.

(01:08:52):
That's where you get feedback on because then when you become a VP, you have done those things before. It's like why is the first time you've done an interview when you're now a VP? Come in and do an interview with me, observe me do an interview, ask questions, see what works, get feedback. That's why I love those group product manager roles because those are actually meant to be designed as ways for people to make a decision if they want to be a manager or they want to just stay in the discipline, but people use them as why would you give somebody four direct reports if no evidence, they can manage one? So what I do is I give you one, you might tell me, I hate people. That's okay, we can talk about that. But it's like, let me give you four and you're just going to practice the bad behavior on four.

(01:09:37):
So this is what often happens in company. We promote them into incompetence. It's not their fault because we are not coaching them. What we need to do is create a safe environment for people to practice leadership before they become leaders, before we promote them. We have to have good coaching programs for leaders to say, if there's a succession plan, I want Lenny to be a new manager. I don't wait till it's time to promote him then I teach him management because then apparently he cannot say things like, I don't know. I have to teach him leadership and management before he becomes a leader or a manager.

Lenny (01:10:10):
I love this idea of just doing VP things. I just picture someone walking around and, I'm doing VP things.

Christian Idiodi (01:10:14):
I'm doing VP things. All the time, I see them live, but what's a VP thing?

Lenny (01:10:19):
I'm doing VP things. I think another added benefit of doing these things before you say you're VP is that is the best way to get promoted to a VP is you are already doing the job.

Christian Idiodi (01:10:28):
That's right. And nobody bites you on it. You see that? And you're not even surprised by it and it's very safe because when you're not in the job, you can make mistakes and nobody blames you. He's not a VP, look at him trying to do VP things. You see? But the second you're a VP, there's so much leverage in the role that your mistake is serious because it impacts everybody. But when you're not, it's like you get coverage, you get protection, nobody's as mad at you. It's like, yeah, he was just trying to take a stab at it. Let's coach him on that. But what is the best time to know those things? It's before you're in it. Before you're in it

Lenny (01:11:06):
To give companies and leaders something to do with this advice, you talk about helping them train and practice before they do this. How did you do that? I don't know, is it work with Silicon Valley Product Group to help train and coach?

Christian Idiodi (01:11:18):
There are many great product coaches out there. There are many leadership coaches out there. I think there's some recognition. People have to have the humility and the self-awareness to recognize that there are opportunities for them to get better as a leader and product management, you need to see or experience, good leadership, you need the reps of good leadership and we do it in everyway. You probably talk to people about strategy and what did they do? They outsource it all the time. Tell somebody else to do it, and that cycle feeds itself because you never do it. You only know how to outsource it. You never learn how to do it. You see? And so many people outsource, oh, go get a mentor, go take a training class, and they'll think that they're outsourcing coaching in that way. It's like go take a communication.

Christian Idiodi (01:12:02):
Sourcing coaching in that way. It's like, " [inaudible 01:12:03]. Go take a communication class." I'm like, "Okay." They come back from the class, and they punch you in the face. I'm like, "Why did you punch me?" "The class taught me to punch you in the face. You paid money for me to learn how to punch you in the face." I say, go to the communication class with the employee because they're going to need to practice the communication.

(01:12:20):
You learn what they're learning. Both of you now will practice it together, so that they can get better at communication. A communication class doesn't get you better at communication. Communicating better is an indication that you're better at communication. You need to practice it. And I need to create a safe place for you to practice, I need to give you feedback that you're communicating better. These are all patterns in coaching that many leaders just don't have these tools and techniques to do it.

(01:12:48):
I do teach a lot of leaders how to coach. I do a lot of people work with leaders. There's not a singular product problem. People here me say, "All problems are people problems." There's not a singular problem that I have not seen coaching address.

Lenny (01:13:04):
What I hear is essentially the biggest burden is on the manager to be a great coach to their reports, and for a manager to get good at this, essentially a coach is a really good method. Bring someone in that could work with you one-on-one on a lot of these things. Awesome. That's very actionable, very solvable.

(01:13:21):
Everyone's always going to ask, "How do I find an awesome coach?" Difficult, I guess. I don't know. What do you tell people to go find a coach? Is there anything you could recommend, just how to go find a coach?

Christian Idiodi (01:13:30):
You've got to find people that have generated good outcomes. People are always like, "How do you find a good consultant?" I get people teaching people a lot that haven't done the job. Don't get me wrong. If you look at American football teams, there are some coaches that have played the game before, and you feel good that they can coach you. And there are also some coaches that have not played the game, but if you look at the pedigree, they've learned from good coaches, they've worked under good coaches.

(01:13:57):
Same thing with product. I say there are only two parts. A good coach is someone that has played the game before and has generated good outcomes, and the second is that they've learned from good product coaches. You want to find people with a strong pedigree. You see [inaudible 01:14:12], and you, "Oh, you worked at Amazon this year," or "You worked at this company," or "You worked at Stripe. [inaudible 01:14:18] good results. How did you do that?"

(01:14:19):
"Oh, my environment was great. The culture was great." "Who taught you? Who coached you?" Do pick-up games with the people that they coached. They will tell you what patterns their coach told them. How do you do that? My coach told me to do this, and you're going to learn from them. I say, "Oh." Important things.

Lenny (01:14:37):
Amazing. Okay. Final area I want to spend a little time on is the work you do in Africa. Marty said that you're the foremost expert in introducing product and technology into world's developing countries. I know you spend a lot of time in Africa specifically. Can you just talk about the work you do there and also just maybe the opportunities and challenges you run into when you're working with folks there?

Christian Idiodi (01:14:56):
Yeah. I have an African background, and my family is there, and I used to have this false notion that the things we've done in North America or Europe or Asia, the problems we've solved, have been solved in these markets. I remember talking to someone in Africa years ago, and he said to me, "Oh." I said, "You just got a new job. Where did you find a job?" He's like, "Oh, I found it in a newspaper." I said, "A newspaper? What do you mean found a job?" I remember participating in solving that exact problem in 1998. I was working with the team to solve that, and I had this false assumption that because I solved it here, of course it's solved everywhere.

(01:15:40):
I started to see patterns like this in Africa where just two things were trending. One, so many, the poor use of technology and enabling technologies to solve problems. And two, the difficulty in actually solving problems in these markets, in these emerging markets. And one of the things we take for granted, I always tell people the government is probably the biggest public private product platform in the world. In all countries, they all have this public... Because they provide the infrastructure and the architecture that is enabling for people.

(01:16:18):
Imagine if you were trying to code and you didn't have power. Now you're thinking there are markets where you have to solve the problem of getting power before you then getting access to a computer and then getting access to the right type of software to be able to code something. Look at all the different things. You have to solve many problems just before you can start to solve the problem in a meaningful way. This is a very big reflection of the dynamic in Africa.

(01:16:44):
The second pattern of what we see is because of this challenge, I see two things. One, people make a lot of money on a problem than from solving the problem. There's this whole society that people are very good at walking around problems. "We've got an electricity problem, we'll just buy generators." "We've got a road problem, we're going to buy bigger cars." I was talk at a conference, and I was driving up to it, and I saw a Tesla with a portable generator at the back of it. They'll stop and charge the Tesla, and they keep going on the road. In some ways, that's a whole society, but it's never been a society that didn't have creative people.

(01:17:26):
Just an amazing, tremendous amount of talent. It's a very young population. I talk to people all the time. I say, "Look." Someone told me, "Well, Africa, seven of the eight most underdeveloped places in the world are in Africa."

(01:17:41):
And I said, "Well." They were talking about the discovery of the internet. Less than 30% of Africa has discovered the internet. And I tell them, "Wow. And we created seven Unicoms from that. Imagine if 50%, 75% discovered the internet. We need to understand the opportunities, the youngest population, the fastest growing, some of the fastest growing economies in these markets. Some of the problems are so basic, and the opportunities are so huge. So I had to kill all these assumptions. One, that I needed permission to come to solve problems there, and two, that we didn't have the means to equip and educate people.

(01:18:24):
We don't have a talent problem or a resource problem. The biggest opportunity I've found is to really empower a continent with enabling technology and the mindset and the skills to be able to leverage technology in solving problems.

(01:18:40):
This led to me starting a nonprofit in Africa, the Innovate Africa Foundation, and we are committed to this education of people on the continent, this enablement with technology. We did our first conference last year, the Inspire Africa Conference. It just blew my mind. I'm so humbled when I could see a thousand people from 31 different countries in Africa come with a hunger and an eagerness to learn how to do product work. And it's not cheap by any means for them to do that.

(01:19:14):
What moved me the most is looking at the future generation. We had a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old in the workshop. The 11-year-old was a robotics engineer. The 13-year-old was a CEO of a small startup that keeps healthcare records, a leader. And I'm like, "If I can help these people learn how to do product well, this is the whole generation for Africa. This is the future of people that want to leverage technology in a meaningful way." So I spend a lot of my time in Africa, coaching, advising and teaching teams how to use technology, how to do product, how to organize themselves as product teams, how to solve problems, and really to create a boldness within the continent for them to go after problems and solve them, than walk around the problems or make money on them.

Lenny (01:20:03):
If people want to learn more about this, maybe support the work you're doing, what's the best way to find out more?

Christian Idiodi (01:20:09):
You can visit the nonprofit website. It's innovateafricafoundation.org. You can follow our work on SVPG or the inspireafricaconference.com. I know I will be doing a lot more next year. In January, I am going to be launching a fund, the Paid Africa Fund, and I want it to be a fund funded by the product community for Africa. It's an angel investment fund. One of the problems I recognize is that so many of the startups, they are not ready for institutional investment, and they are forced into it in some ways. They say people are giving up a lot of equity when they just need cashflow. And so I really want to focus on a fund for the community to enable people to get product market fit in those markets.

(01:20:55):
That'll be launching in January. I'll probably do an announcement about it. I'm excited about that work and to really try to promote more of product-centric thinking on the continent.

Lenny (01:21:06):
Amazing. You should call this fun reference customers or something along those lines, if the goal is to help them find product market [inaudible 01:21:12]-

Christian Idiodi (01:21:12):
That's right. They'll be learning a lot of that.

Lenny (01:21:15):
Christian, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Christian Idiodi (01:21:21):
I've always made an appeal to the product community to really have a sense of what they do beyond the job of a products team or product manager. And I always try to encourage people to see that: at the very core of what you do is really solving a problem. And that's creating... When you do that, create value in the world, you're making a dent in the world. People that participate in trying to make things better or trying to solve problems, and we should not shy from that definition of our job.

(01:21:58):
It might feel like a fluffy one. It might feel too lightweight and not meaningful, but I think when people take to heart that that's really what the essence of products is or product work is, they bring to work a different passion, they bring to work a different sense of empathy, they bring to work a different sense of customer centricity. And all of those things lead to good outcomes.

(01:22:21):
I always make that appeal to product people as like, "Yeah, all the frameworks, techniques, all the stuff, just think truly about what you're trying to do. You're trying to care enough about a problem to solve it on someone's behalf and do it so well that it give us something every time."

Lenny (01:22:37):
I really love that last point of just that's how you know if you've built something people care about. They give you something in return, and one of those things could be actually telling other people about it.

Christian Idiodi (01:22:44):
That's right.

Lenny (01:22:46):
To your point about reference customers.

Christian Idiodi (01:22:46):
Yes.

Lenny (01:22:47):
Amazing. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Christian Idiodi (01:22:52):
I don't have a choice.

Lenny (01:22:54):
Nope. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Christian Idiodi (01:22:59):
Oh boy. In this discipline, probably all of our books: Inspired, Empowered, and we are coming up with one in March, Transformed.

Lenny (01:23:08):
I see that tee shirt there. I see the promo happening.

Christian Idiodi (01:23:10):
Yes, it's happening. It's happening. But it's really a reflection of so many decades of love and passion for product work. And I have not found, I always told Maddie that you write the books after have gone through the failure. It's like, "I've failed at leadership, now there's a book on it. I've failed at product, now there's a book on it." And it reflects really the heart of good product work. I love Ben said the hard thing about hard things I love. There's some books that really describe the mindset and culture that good product work is done in. I always recommend those to people.

Lenny (01:23:43):
Just on this topic of Transformed while we're on it, when is it coming out, and can you give just an elevator pitch for the book just so people know what it'll be about?

Christian Idiodi (01:23:49):
Transformed is coming out March next year. Oh God, just three months. Some people should have gotten shipping dates on their books if you pre-ordered it now. But it really talks about how to move to the product model or the product operating model, which is really this set of beliefs and principles that the best companies work in. We share stories of companies that have transformed into this that are not your traditional bond digital or bond tech companies that have made this transition. We tell stories of what companies can do. If it's anything, it's an appeal that there is a better way of working and solving problems and that companies can work in this way regardless of where you are in the journey.

Lenny (01:24:32):
All right. We'll have to have you back once the book comes out to get more people aware of what is happening. Amazing. Okay, I'll keep going. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Christian Idiodi (01:24:41):
I jumped on the Succession bandwagon, and I enjoyed, and I used to love Billions too as well. I love good writing, really just intellectual media writing business. And so probably Succession and Billions would be two.

Lenny (01:24:57):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing candidates?

Christian Idiodi (01:25:02):
Well, I always give them a problem to solve. That is probably my favorite question, and it's not a traditional problem. I probably will see something like, "Hey Lenny, I have a friend. He's been legally deaf or hearing impaired his whole life, and he just got a new job that requires him to wake up significantly earlier than he normally does. And as you can imagine, traditional alarm clocks will not do it, will not solve the problem. And I would love to give that problem to you. Walk me through how you go about tackling this or solving this." For me, I like that question because it gives me a sense of how you think. It gives me a sense of how you solve problems. It gives me a sense of how you know what you do not know and how you go about knowing the things you need to know, what you need to solve a problem.

(01:25:52):
There's no magical right or wrong answer. I do a lot of people that say, "I have no clue what to do. I'm more curious and because I want to now know what you do, but you don't have a clue." Or people that jump straight to solutions, are more engineering-centric. People that jump straight to... I can get a sense of who you are when I give you a problem that requires you to do some thinking.

Lenny (01:26:15):
And you're doing this live in an interview? It's not like, "Go home and think about this, and then-

Christian Idiodi (01:26:20):
Oh, I'm doing this live in an interview.

Lenny (01:26:20):
Live, okay. And then what's a sign that they're on the right track? What do you look for that's like, "Yes, this is what I want to see"?

Christian Idiodi (01:26:26):
Remember, when I think about what makes a good product manager, I look about collaborative problem solving. There are people that feel like, I'm just going to solve the whole thing myself. This is what we should do. We should do it like no evidence, no data, no kind of stuff in there. It's very interesting. But people that are saying, "You know what? I would need probably work an engineer and designer. We might need to put [inaudible 01:26:46]." I look for intellectual curiosity in some ways, people that have proven questions in your head. People that are very quick to see things [inaudible 01:26:54] people. I will talk to 20 of them. I say, "How you going to do that? Do you know sign language?" And they're like, "Oh, how am I going to talk to them?" There are people that are like, "I'm going to need a lot of help to try to figure this out. I don't know a lot about your friend, but I know..." Some people have frameworks they run to. It exposes that, if they're married to one way of working.

(01:27:14):
It's more about knowing what you can't know. I'm looking for empathy, humility in some sense. It is a competence thing because most of I can teach, I can coach a lot of things, but that arrogance, that ego, those kinds of things, those "I walk alone," those things are very, very challenging and disruptive to a team culture.

Lenny (01:27:35):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like? Either an app or something physical? Anything that's like, "Oh, this is really cool"?

Christian Idiodi (01:27:43):
My eldest son is into sports. He loves all kinds of sports stuff, sports apps, all of those kinds of things, and he got me on this app called Real, like real sports. It's really cool. It shows scores of different games, but it's really driven by social influence. So all of your Twitter posts will get there like, "Oh my God, [inaudible 01:28:07]." It's almost like real time more than real time. You're getting real time with reactions of people around you and your communities.

(01:28:15):
It's a very different way of checking on a score than I've ever seen, and I thought it was just really, really thoughtful in how... I want to share reaction to touchdown with 50 people around the world that will care about my favorite team just got a touchdown, and you'll all share reactions at the same time. And the first person that saw it, you can see it. It's very simple. This is like scores for games, but these days I don't check my scores anywhere else but on it.

Lenny (01:28:45):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends, either in work or in life, that you find useful?

Christian Idiodi (01:28:52):
Wow, boy. I've said a lot in this talk about companies don't care about about you, people care about you. It's never too late to be what you want to be. But early on, my father would always tell me, "Show up. Show up, and you're ahead of 80% of the people in the free world. Show up on time, and you're ahead of 85% of the people in the free world. Show up on time with a plan, and you're ahead of 90% of the people in the free world. And if somehow you have the guts to put that plan to action with a smile, then you probably will have a great chance of success. And if you do that over and over again, every aspect of your life, it can at least lead to successful outcomes." And I think that's a lot of some mental definition for me every day.

Lenny (01:29:37):
Amazing. I love that. Final question: as maybe the most interesting man in the world, is there anything people may not know about you or would be surprised to hear about?

Christian Idiodi (01:29:48):
Wow. I hope there are no surprises about me in that kind of case in that way, but I went to a gifted and talented school. I was out of my house at 12, and I went to kind of boarding school, and I've never been back home since then, so I've kind of been on my own. But we are kind of in the middle of nowhere, probably eight miles from any form of civilization and stuff in the middle of the jungle. No potable water, no electricity. So you kind of had to get water yourself, generate your own power. Probably the most interesting time in my life to shape my worldview, surviving at 12 to 16 on my own in the middle of the jungle. Very intriguing part of my life.

Lenny (01:30:40):
Very different from your life these days. Actually, one more question. I think you're the fourth... You're from Nigeria, right? Your family's from Nigeria?

Christian Idiodi (01:30:47):
Yes.

Lenny (01:30:47):
You're the fourth Nigerian guest on this podcast, I realized. And I always like to ask, what's your favorite Nigerian food slash which food should people seek out if they were to try to find some good Nigerian food?

Christian Idiodi (01:30:59):
My favorite Nigerian is super-duper cultural and native. It's like starch and [inaudible 01:31:06] soup. You can't really find that anywhere, it got to come from mom's cooking. Marty Cagan has tried it. He came to my hometown, my parents' house and had it. But if you are discovering Nigerian food, [inaudible 01:31:18] is a variation of rice, which everybody has, jollof rice, and yes people, I'm going to say this: jollof rice, Nigerian jollof is better than Ghanaian jollof. It's a war, but it's okay. We already claim victory, and we'll move on. But start with jollof rice is elementary, but then you have to try [inaudible 01:31:34] like a pounded yam with a soup. There are many different variations of that. And you get a pounded yam, like pounded cassava, and you eat that with a soup, and you will love it.

Lenny (01:31:45):
Some controversy over here, competition-

Christian Idiodi (01:31:47):
That's right.

Lenny (01:31:47):
... for who's got the best rice. Amazing. Christian, I am now a huge fan of yours. I'm so happy we did this. Thank you so much for making time for this. Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Christian Idiodi (01:32:00):
You can find me on LinkedIn as well. You can reach out to us on our websites svpg.com. I tell people the best fit to be useful to us is to do good work using these principles and all the things we teach people over and over again. We care about outcomes, we care about good product work in the world. I would love your support with the work I'm doing in Africa. I've always reached out to the product community around the world to help developing countries and communities. So please follow our work, please support our work in Africa in building a product community.

Lenny (01:32:35):
And what is the website for that again? Specifically the nonprofit you started?

Christian Idiodi (01:32:38):
Innovateafricafoundation.org.

Lenny (01:32:41):
Amazing. Christian, thank you so much for being here.

Christian Idiodi (01:32:44):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. Such a pleasure.

# The ultimate guide to OKRs | Christina Wodtke (Stanford)

## Transcript

Christina Wodtke (00:00:00):
... people do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, "Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations and oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better." The simple act of getting together and saying, "What was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week? What's the most awesome thing that happened in marketing? What's the most awesome thing that design did this week?" It makes people feel like they're part of something really special, and it's super exciting.

Lenny (00:00:30):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Christina Wodtke. Christina is a multi-time author, speaker, and lecturer at Stanford where she teaches product management, game design, and a few other topics. She also consults with companies on their product development processes, and in particular, their OKR process. Before getting into teaching and consulting, she was a product leader at LinkedIn, MySpace, Zynga, and Yahoo, as well as a founder of three different companies, plus an online magazine called Boxes and Arrows. In our conversation, we go deep into OKRs. What is the atomic unit of an OKR? What might be broken about your OKR process? Why you may want to roll out OKRs or change how you approach them. 

(00:01:20):
Also, how the best companies leverage OKRs, the most common root causes of OKRs going wrong, the elements of a healthy OKR cadence, how OKRs fit with mission, vision, strategy, and roadmaps. We also touch on the skill of storytelling. And she also shares her most contrarian perspective on what new product managers should be focusing on. Christina is a wealth of knowledge and super interesting and fun, and I know you'll learn a lot from her. 

(00:01:45):
With that, I bring you Christina Wodtke, after a short word from our select sponsors. Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on.

(00:02:22):
For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, library actions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's prints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wireframes, draw ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board, and with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O .com/lenny. 

(00:02:58):
This episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights platform for teams that gets you from data to insights fast, no matter the method. There's so much customer data to get through, from user interviews to NPS, sales calls, usability tests, support tickets, app reviews. It's a lot, and you know that if you're building something, hidden in that data are the insights that will lead you to building better products, and that's where Dovetail can help. Dovetail allows you to quickly analyze customer data from any source and transform it into evidence-based insights that your whole team can access. If you're a product manager who needs insights to motivate your team, a designer validating your next pick feature or a researcher who needs to analyze fast, Dovetail is the collaborative insight platform your whole team can use.

Christina Wodtke (00:03:55):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm really excited to be here. I've been hearing about you forever. It's so cool to be here in person.

Lenny (00:04:00):
I'm more excited for you to be on the podcast. I kind of see you as the queen of OKRs. I don't know if you like that title or not, but in my mind that's where you sit currently, and partly because from what I can tell, you've done more to help people with OKRs and understand OKRs and fix their OKR process than most anyone else I know. As I'm sure you know, a lot of people just don't like OKRs, are kind of anti-OKR and have had bad experiences with OKRs. And what I want to try to do with our chat today is to try to change people's mind, who are maybe anti-OKR and to help people optimize their OKR process if they're having an okay time with OKRs. How does that sound?

Christina Wodtke (00:04:39):
That sounds just fine, although I have to say in the tech industry, it's a little too easy to be clean. Maybe when I'm a emperor for life, that might be my title.

Lenny (00:04:48):
That might be by the end of this podcast, we will crown you emperor for life. 

Christina Wodtke (00:04:52):
Excellent. 

Lenny (00:04:54):
Okay. That'll be our goal. So, as maybe a first question, I want to give people kind of this confidence that OKRs can lead to great product, great success. What can you share, just to give people a sense of, "Here's how many companies who are having a great time with OKRs, here's the impact OKRs can have on your company if you roll it out or make it more optimal."

Christina Wodtke (00:05:15):
I've seen so many companies do extremely well with it, and I would say that not all companies will be successful, period. Companies are really successful with it are companies that... I think I can swear a little, they have their shit together.

Lenny (00:05:27):
Absolutely. 100%. 

Christina Wodtke (00:05:29):
And the first step is, get your shit together. They have strategy, they have empowered teams, they have psychological safety, and then the OKRs are that extra layer that supercharges them. So, I say OKRs are more of a vitamin, they're not a medicine. So, if you take OKRs and you're like, "Oh, this will fix everything that's wrong with you." No, that's not going to happen. It's just going to reveal everything that's wrong with your company. But if you've done the hard work of getting your company to be strong, it's amazing how well it works. It works really well with startups. It works really well with multidisciplinary product teams. I've seen it over and over. I don't really have permission to talk about all my clients, but I have one client that I'm just working with right now, and it's a purpose built company. So, in other words, they exist in order to make the lives of their customers better, healthier, wellness.

(00:06:20):
And so, they used OKRs to really create this amazing focus on, what does it mean to make everybody's life healthier? And one thing that came out of applying OKRs was this wonderful idea, they're bringing robots into their warehouses, not to replace their humans, they're keeping all the humans, but to reduce the amount of back problems their humans have. So, the humans are doing much more complex tasks, thinking about inventory and how to be more efficient. And the robots are doing the heavy lifting. 

(00:06:51):
They've been growing and growing like crazy. And the OKRs are this very simple way of allowing you to focus on what actually matters and making sure you don't forget in the chaos of everyday life. So, if you know what you're trying to do, then the OKRs just help that happen. It aligns the company. And I think they're a lot like dieting advice, in that they say, "Eat less and exercise more." Well, that's really simple. It's worked for me. I've lost 25 pounds doing eat less and exercise more. But wow, it's hard. It's really hard to do. And I think about OKRs that way. You have to just stay with it and be strong and committed, and that will help.

Lenny (00:07:36):
There's a number of things I want to follow up on in what you said. 

Christina Wodtke (00:07:39):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:07:39):
So, I'll start with, you talked about the benefits of OKR. If you had to just boil down, here's what OKRs can do for you as a company, as an organization, what would that be? What's just the main benefit of OKRs at your company?

Christina Wodtke (00:07:51):
The main benefit is that there's a lot of concrete action through a OKR that you don't always get from strategy. Strategy tends to be a little longer, a little more Muji Muji. And then when you get the OKR, you say, "This quarter is what we're actually going to be doing, and these are the numbers we're actually going to be pushing further." So, that's really good. It creates a cadence of progress, which is incredibly valuable. It creates alignment. There's no question what the single most important thing to do in the company is, assuming you're doing radical focus and you don't have 20 OKRs every quarter. Ugh, don't like to think about that. And last of all, the thing that I don't see a lot of people talking about that I think is really amazing, is because an OKR focuses you for one quarter and at the end of the quarter you grade your OKRs.

(00:08:40):
How well did we do? What got in our way? It creates this learning cycle. So, then you can take that information and say, "Next quarter, what should we try next?" And I think the time is the thing that a lot of leaders really struggle to think about. But if you've been really focusing on say, retention for one quarter, two quarters, and then you go over and say, "Okay, let's work on acquisition." You don't forget all the things you learned about retention. No, you're just building knowledge and building knowledge and building knowledge, which means your company will constantly get smarter and more effective.

Lenny (00:09:13):
I love this. So, just to summarize, the main benefits are focuses you, lines, creates a cadence and creates a learning cycle. And maybe a simple way to think about it is, it's like a plug-and-play product development process. You don't have to invent everything from scratch. There's this thing that exists. I know it's not the whole piece of it, but yeah, maybe... You're nodding and I'm curious, when I say that, what comes to mind?

Christina Wodtke (00:09:36):
Yeah, I guess you have to have a product development process, because obviously otherwise you're just running around chickens with your heads cut off, but it keeps you from making the same stupid mistake over and over and over again, which has been a goal in my life. My motto is, "Make new mistakes." So, by having this focus on really important things, not to spread yourself too thin, like the famous peanut butter memo from Yahoo, which I guess was long ago enough, not everybody remembers it. But companies have a tendency to try to do everything all at this exact moment. And so, everybody's working with 1% on this, 1% on that and 1% on the other. And instead you use the OKRs and say, "Okay, this is the big rock we're going to move. This is the big thing that's going to happen this quarter, and you can fiddle around with all the other stuff if you want, but this one has to move."

(00:10:27):
And then the next quarter, the next thing gets moved and so on. And it just accelerates the speed of your accomplishments so much. It's kind of mind-blowing. I've actually been running my life for the last eight, 10 years on OKRs as well because I'm ADHD and I'm all over the place. And so, looking at my OKRs every single Monday and saying, "Well, am I going to work on a book? Am I going to work on my teaching? Am I going to work... Where do I want to put that attention?" It changes me personally, just like it changes my clients.

Lenny (00:11:00):
What's an example of your personal care? You said writing a book maybe could be one?

Christina Wodtke (00:11:03):
Well, I wish, but no, it's actually been health. One of the great things about managing my OKRs for so long is I discovered this pattern, which is that anytime things get busy, I just stop taking care of myself completely. And that's really bad because if I'm healthy, I can be there for my kid, I can be there for my students, I can be there for my colleagues. So, this quarter's been about setting up habits of well-being and like I said, I've been really pleased at how it's been going.

Lenny (00:11:30):
Amazing. I haven't heard that before. What would you say is kind of the atomic unit of an OKR? So, people talk about, "We're doing OKRs, we're not doing OKRs". What's the line between we have goals and a plan, and we're actually doing OKRs as a concept?

Christina Wodtke (00:11:44):
Gosh, what is the atomic unit? That's a really lovely question. I would say, "What am I doing this week to get closer to our goals?" If you could answer that question, you could give up all the OKR stuff, but if you just asked the question, "What are we doing this week to get closer to our strategic goals, our longer term goals?" That is the very heart of it, because there's the tomorrow problem, like my kid will do his homework tomorrow, and tomorrow never comes. It's always tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. So, what are we doing right now? And I find that it's really useful to tie it into temporal landmarks. 

(00:12:21):
By that I mean that there are things like birthdays or New Year's or Mondays or quarters that are already built into the world. And so, we piggyback onto them and we say, "Okay, it's Q1, boom, we're going to stop. We're going to take a breath, we're going to look at everything and we're going to say, 'What do we actually have to do?'" Raising your head above the noise is really vital. "And then this quarter, remember we have a mission over here and we have a vision and we have a strategy. Okay, this quarter's all about, what?" And you move towards that. 

(00:12:52):
I know there's a lot of talk about outcomes and I think that's absolutely right. It's really critical to think about outcomes because that gives you flexibility on how to attack the problem. But the biggest question is, why? Why do we get up in the morning? What are we trying to actually do? Are we making a difference at all? And if you can say, "This week I'm going to do this," and then at the end of the week you say, "Oh, that worked or that didn't work," and you can try something new or keep going. That's just invaluable.

Lenny (00:13:18):
That is really interesting that your answer wasn't like its outcome or some key results and 70% of success is goal, that there's something more fundamental, which is just being very clear on what you should be doing next week and we should be focusing on now. And that translates into what kind of the OKR process ends up being.

Christina Wodtke (00:13:34):
Oh, yeah. Can I tell you a little story?

Lenny (00:13:37):
Absolutely.

Christina Wodtke (00:13:37):
So, this is personal OKRs, but it works for everything else. It's always easier to talk about personal OKRs because I don't have to do an NDA with myself, so I apologize. But I've had this accountability group with these three women for at least five years, and every Monday we send our OKRs to each other, and I do it the way I do it in the book. Another woman, she had the getting things done approach where it was like, "How percentage did I make and what am I trying to do?" And exactly, super detailed. 

(00:14:06):
And then another woman was like, "Ah, I don't know. I guess I'm trying to think about... What am I trying to think about? Oh, maybe I should think about if I have to get out of product management or not." Well, now the woman who was very precise has kind of disappeared. I think it was just something that she couldn't keep up that level of diligence. While the woman who was hand-waving, she actually has gone from a product manager to a consultant to a life coach, and she's making so much money, and she is so damn happy, and she has a new house. And so, I really do think that the heart of everything is answering that question.

Lenny (00:14:44):
And what is that question?

Christina Wodtke (00:14:46):
What am I doing this week to get to the outcome I really want? Her outcome was to not worry about money and be joyful with what she was doing. And she got that just by every Monday saying, "What the fuck am I doing here? What am I trying to do again?" And it worked.

Lenny (00:15:03):
That is a really cool framework. So, the question you ask yourself every week is, "What am I doing today that's helping me get closer to my outcomes?" Is that the word to use outcome?

Christina Wodtke (00:15:12):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it is an outcome. In her case, it was not worrying about money, having a house, having joy in her work. I think a lot of us get caught up in, do I want to be a writer? Do I want to be this thing? When the reality is, we just want to be satisfied and happy. And with a business, it's the same thing. We get caught up in this or that little details, but you need to go back and say, "What was our mission?" I mean, think about it. How often do companies ever talk about their mission? It's like they set it, they forget it, it's super vague, it's useless. 

(00:15:42):
Instead, it's good to think, "Okay, when we started this company or when we changed this company or grew this company," or whatever you want to go to, there's always these various points in time. "Why? What did we think would work? And let's go back to that moment of meaning and reconnect with it and then make it real in the activities we take every week." And I like every week rather than every day. Because the reality is we still have to do progress reviews and we still have to do accounting and whatnot, but if we just push a little bit each week, over time amazing things happen.

Lenny (00:16:15):
So, I want to drill into some of these things, of just how mission, vision, roadmap and OKRs kind of fit together, just to be pretty tactical. So, as a PM say, or founder, what is the process you recommend for working through mission, vision, and then OKRs, and then roadmap?

Christina Wodtke (00:16:33):
I think it's really important to have a mission, and people get freaked out because they think the mission's forever. And so, they make them super vague so they can do anything. But instead, if you think about it, if the mission lasts for five years, what would you like to see happen in five years? And it might be, "We're going to bring amazing games that delight our users and we're proud to ship into the world." That could be a mission. And it's like, "Okay, I could do that over the next five years." And then, there'll be a point where you probably want to change again. So, you're bringing, what does it mean? What does it mean to be proud? What does it mean to delight people? Really talk about that and get into the nitty-gritty. And then out of that would come your strategy, which is this is going to be our year of exploration, if you have enough money for such a thing.

(00:17:18):
Or this is going to be our year of making our current games a little bit better. I'm in a very game mindset today because I was talking to a client. So, you get into that. Okay, now we have this sort of idea of what we're doing with our year. Now, let's talk about the quarter. And you can use OKRs for the year, but the quarter is where they have the most impact, I believe. Spotify talked about doing quarterly performance reviews because it's long enough to get something done and short enough to not forget what you did. And I think that sums it up perfectly for OKRs as well. So, once you know where you're trying to be, and once you know what you want to do with your year, you can say, "What are the things we want to see happen across these four quarters?"

(00:18:01):
I call it sort of a half-built strategy because too much strategy ties you down and too little strategy, you're too responsive to everything. So, you say, "Okay." Let's say you're building a new game. So, Q1 is about figuring out what it is and what's going to be interesting to users. And then Q2 is going to be about getting some early prototypes out and validating those concepts. And Q3 is about building extensive, and Q4 is about marketing and throwing it out, something like that. And you could venture them into your outcomes. A lot of people who are very venture driven don't understand outcomes, objectives, excuse me, objectives, outcomes, potato, potato.

Lenny (00:18:39):
And they sound horrid.

Christina Wodtke (00:18:39):
It's really something inspiring. Q1, we have a vision for this game that will drive us forward. I don't know, I'm making stuff up, which just means it's going to be imperfect. Although I do warn people not to get too caught up in wordsmithing. We can spend hours doing that. And then, you get to ask my favorite question, how do we know? I love, how do we know? That's how you get to outcomes. So, what does it mean to have a vision for a product we believe will be successful and meet our mission, whatnot? Well, what would it be? How are we going to figure this out? So, something about user testing, probably. Maybe we do a landing page, see how many people are excited by the concept. Maybe we do some technical builds to see if it's actually buildable. What are the sort of things that would tell us, yes, please go forward? We might be excited about VR. Well, how do we know that VR would be profitable for us? 

(00:19:35):
So, once we answer those three, how would we know, then we can know that by March we have the results we need. And we're always going to try to think about the best possible future, the whole moonshot thing, which I'm a fan of, but the reality is, the reason we do that estimating is so we get good at estimating. Everybody sucks at estimating when you first start, and a lot of people think it's like black magic or something you're born with. But no, it's a learned skill. You practice estimating, you get good at estimating, you get better and better and better. And being good at estimating is incredibly valuable as a business skill. So, there's your OKRs, right? And then for Q2, we don't know how Q1 is going to go, so we're just going to leave the objective there, but we're not going to get into the nitty-gritty OKRs. Key results cause a lot of arguing among the team, takes forever to track them down, just wait and see how Q1 goes. And that way you have enough play within your strategy to react to new information.

Lenny (00:20:32):
The question you talked about of, how do we know? That's to decide the objective or the key results?

Christina Wodtke (00:20:39):
Key results, yeah.

Lenny (00:20:40):
Okay, got it. You're saying objective. Okay, cool.

Christina Wodtke (00:20:42):
Objective. My bad. I didn't signal when I turned. No.

Lenny (00:20:49):
Oh, okay, cool. That makes sense.

Christina Wodtke (00:20:49):
Objective is that vision for the quarter. This is what we're we're driving towards in this quarter. And then the key results, you answered the question, how do we know we succeeded?

Lenny (00:20:58):
And so, what was the tip you gave of turning strategy into the objective? How do you translate from strategy to deciding your objective for the core?

Christina Wodtke (00:21:06):
Oh, that sits between mission and OKRs. So, strategy, I've been really shocked lately. I've discovered that lots of companies don't seem to have any strategy whatsoever, which just blows my mind. So, if you think about strategy as a strongly held hypothesis about a way to win in the market and fulfill our vision, then you can say, "Well, our mission is this, or vision..." I kind of use them interchangeably because I think they are kind of interchangeable, and I'm not going to get in semantics in the bitty bits, but the strategy is really important because it says, "We think we're fulfilling our mission of connecting people, by what?"

(00:21:55):
I think that there are a lot of good product strategy pieces out there, but businesses have a lot of questions to answer. Are we going to ship physical products? Are we going to ship digital products? Are we going to be a service? Are we going to do a subscription? Strategy answers those questions. They say, "We're going to have a game. It's going to be an Apple Arcade. We have a hypothesis that's actually going to help us. We're going to build in there and build our customer base there in order to get name recognition, which we can then use on other platforms." That's the sort of strategic stuff. And then we're like, "Oh great, you have a vision. What are we doing? What does that actually mean for us this year, this quarter, and then eventually this week?"

Lenny (00:22:39):
For the actual OKRs you end up with, is it as simple as just with the template of an OKR, is it just objective three-ish key results? Is there anything more to it that you recommend folks use? 

Christina Wodtke (00:22:51):
No. Simple things give you a lot more room to fiddle. And I feel like every time I see people make really complicated methodologies, they get way too caught up in the rules and they don't think about, what are we actually trying to do? So, simple is better.

Lenny (00:23:04):
And what's your rule of thumb for number of key results?

Christina Wodtke (00:23:06):
I like three. I think about it as triangulating. I always like something that's really hardcore numbers. I like something that's a little squishier, like a quality, make sure you don't forget about it. And I usually like something that involves a dollar sign, but it's really going to be specific to what objective you're trying to do. Launch a new product. Well, you probably want to make a certain amount of money, well you want a certain amount of reach, and then you want that delight thing. And then when you get into the delight thing, you can say, "Well, is it going to be Metacritic? Is it going to be a survey? Is it going to be NPS?" You know, could figure out what one makes the most sense for you.

Lenny (00:23:45):
That's an interesting topic. Is there anything you find there to measure customer happiness, satisfaction, delight? What have you seen work best for that sort of squishy stuff?

Christina Wodtke (00:23:53):
I know there's a big backlash against NPS. I think it's okay. It's really funny because you can be insanely successful with a game that people feel yucky to play, and you can be incredibly successful with a product people hate using. Zoom, for example. How many times have you heard Zoom get cussed out? So, the question is, why would I care about that if I'm making money? And I would say the answer is, would you like to keep making money? It's always about retention. 

Lenny (00:24:23):
Right.

Christina Wodtke (00:24:24):
So, anytime you can get strong retention signals, I think those are good signals to get. So, that comes out of qualitative research. There's nothing better. So, if you don't have a qualitative researcher on your team, I think you should get one. You need somebody who knows how to separate what people say and what they do, and what the truth is in that. And then use that to apply to your strategic decisions, so that happy users sell your product for you, right? Happy users stay with your product. Happy users are willing to type an email telling you when you're messing up. I mean, you want committed users. They're just so important.

Lenny (00:24:58):
One final question around the actual OKR document. What do you find are the most one or two common mistakes people make when writing out the objective or the key result in deciding on what to go with?

Christina Wodtke (00:25:09):
Objectives, people make them so fluffy that they don't have any meaning. They really should be a proper goal. We're doing this because we want to see this happen, it matters. We want to delight our customers. Sometimes people make them too fluffy and sometimes they make them too boring. It's like, "Oh, we're going to ship this thing." That doesn't inspire anybody. Your objectives should make you, when your alarm goes off and you wake up, you go, "Oh yeah, I'm changing the world today, or I'm doing something really cool." It shouldn't be like, snooze. So, I think an objective should be motivating but not ridiculous. 

(00:25:42):
And then the key results, it's always going to be tasks. I mean, people put tasks in there all the time, and it can be tricky. Sometimes it feels like a task, like you have to get past a product review, so it's going to have a binary. They either said yes or no. But when you think about it, it is an outcome because it's really hard to get a product review group to say okay to anything. So, making sure that you have real outcomes that let you move forward, I think that's the biggest mistake people make in OKRs.

Lenny (00:26:13):
Yeah. I know you shared a few examples of just that came top-of-mind, but just is there any examples you can think of just, here's a really good example of an outcome? And I think your results are a lot easier, just move this metric 10% or hit-

Christina Wodtke (00:26:25):
Let's try to keep it fairly concrete. You're a online magazine selling interior design ideas. So, what are you trying to do? You're trying to get strong leads out to your advertisers, and that's really important, and you're doing it because you believe that people deserve to have homes that are warm and wonderful. You have this mission, and you want to make money while you do it. So, your strategy is going to be about connecting human beings with the brands that will suit their lifestyle. Okay, that's great. And then we get to the nitty-gritty, well, what does that actually mean? Are we going to really work on recommendations passionately? Are we going to really create various markets and throw down advertising where we think these people are? That's when your strategy comes into play because you're making all these interesting choices. So, let's say we're going to double down on recommendations, which has a lot of presuppositions.

(00:27:23):
We have to get people to like, we have to understand their patterns of behavior, and that's when we can start to go to OKRs. We can say, "Okay, so we have this online magazine, let's really work to get as many people being members rather than browsers as possible, so that we can start understanding what they like." And that's what Q1 could be really about, is starting to collect profiles of people's passions, and that sounds kind of exciting. "Okay, great. We're going to do that. We're going to create a profile of people's passions. Awesome." So, how would we know we were successful? "Oh, gosh. Well, we probably need a bunch of people to do it, but do we really need everybody? Maybe 30% of our audience flips over, and maybe that's right, maybe that's wrong." If you don't know, you just set it and you'll know by the end of Q3, whether you were stupid or not, it's fine, move on.

(00:28:12):
Okay, that's great. Okay, how many things should people do what with? So, they bookmark, favorite, like... How about like? Okay, so maybe they're going to like a certain number of products each week. Let's go for weekly active users. So, they're going to like three things and present it. Okay, so now we've got a couple of numbers that are pretty good. How do we know they're actually kind of liking it? Maybe you decide to do some panels, and we're going to measure using a customer panel, bring them in, have them talk to us, and we're going to do that at the end of every two weeks to hear how it's working and understand more about it. 

(00:28:54):
Okay, now we have some OKRs. With key results, I always recommend spending 10 minutes brainstorming every single way you could possibly measure that outcome. Because with brainstorms, you always think of all the obvious stuff first and then you have no ideas and you're just sitting there with your post notes going, "How long is 10 minutes anyway?" And then you start getting the weird ideas. And often out of those weird ideas are really good insights. So, I recommend some pretty long brainstormings on the key results, but the objective is sort of a manifestation of the strategy at a one quarter level.

Lenny (00:29:26):
Amazing. That was an awesome example. You talked a bit earlier about how OKRs end up being... or sorry, key results end up being tasks for a lot of people. And this reminds me, we had the CPO of Figma on this podcast, and he told the story of how they moved away from OKRs at one point because they found themselves sitting in these meetings reviewing these large spreadsheets of hundreds of tasks- 

Christina Wodtke (00:29:49):
Oh, god. Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:50):
... that were basically just tasks for ICs that they're working on, and they kind of lost sight of why does any of this matter? What are you even trying to do as a company? So, they moved away from OKRs and then they came back to them actually later and fixing some of these issues. So, maybe just as a question, what do you think is a sign that your OKR process is busted and that you need to spend some time improving and rethinking the way it works?

Christina Wodtke (00:30:13):
I think if those meetings are boring, that's a great example. One of the other benefits, which I didn't bring up about OKRs is that they scale really well. One of the biggest problems founders struggle with is they don't scale very well, but if you can set a good OKR and get people to work on it, then you don't have to decide all those little IC tasks. You don't want to be drug down with that. You got a job. CEOs got to figure out what's coming up down the line, not fiddling over everybody's tasks. So, you set the OKRs and then you ask in the meeting, "What are the top three initiatives that you're doing towards them?" Or two or five, whatever. It's going to vary a little bit, but you want to keep it small. You only want to look at the most important stuff and just trust your people to take care of everything else.

(00:30:58):
And then you can say, "Well, why do you think that's important? What do you think that's going to do?" Or, "I've been seeing that for weeks. Are you going to try something else anytime soon?" It's all about those conversations about, is our current strategy, not just at the company level, but at each departmental level, are these strategies working? Are they moving us forward, towards our goals? And so, looking through OKRs, I tell people, "When you first start, it might take a half hour, but after that it should just take 10 minutes." It's like, "I think that's stupid. We should talk about that." Or, "No, it looks fine, looks essentially correct, let's move on. Anybody got anything?" And then you can get into whatever else you do, if it's a metrics review situation or if it's talking about a new deal, the rest of the agenda.

(00:31:43):
But that constant checking in is like touching a lucky stone in your pocket. It reminds you, "Oh yeah, there's this thing, there's this thing." And that rhythm... I'm a teacher, I'm really into learning theory. So, there's a really big concept which is about repetition and retrieval practice. So, retrieval practice means that I put a fact in your brain and I keep asking you to go back and get it again. Qualitative research is really useful for understanding the psychology of your users.

(00:32:15):
I'll say, "Well, how do we understand the psychology of users?" And you'd be like, "Oh, I heard this." Okay, I bring it up. Well, it's the same thing in these weekly meetings, you're practicing retrieving what your OKRs are, and after a while they're just in that long-term memory and you don't have to struggle to think about them and you've got them. And anytime you make a decision and you're in a big rush, you don't want to go through a bunch of paper to try to find what were our OKRs? You just go, "Boo, this is what we should do. I know what we're trying to do and I know how to make a decision about that."

Lenny (00:32:44):
So, what I'm hearing is, a lot of this comes back to, if the meeting is not interesting and boring, change the way you run the meeting. Don't go through everything. Maybe just pick the things that are most interesting and focus on that. You don't have to review every single key result.

Christina Wodtke (00:32:57):
Keep the meeting level at the right place. I'm sorry, I wandered off in a different direction. I get really nerdy around learning theory.

Lenny (00:33:03):
No, I love it. I love learning how to learn. Feel free to share more as things come up. Okay. So, I don't know. I'm trying to think. Figma, I imagine they probably thought they could change this meeting, but I think maybe there's a more deep-rooted issue. And this is kind of where my next question is going to go, is what do you think are just the root issues of OKRs going wrong? 

Christina Wodtke (00:33:24):
Oh, my god.

Lenny (00:33:25):
Maybe that's a symptom of the meeting, they're really boring, but yeah.

Christina Wodtke (00:33:27):
Well, the symptom, it's really wrong. Yeah, it means that you're in the weeds, man. You're fiddling with the little tiny bits. You got to let go of those. You have to trust your people. So, if we do the five why's, okay, why don't you trust your people? Is it you or are you hiring horribly? Okay, if you're hiring horribly, why are you hiring horribly? Is it because you can't find the right people? Is it because you're rushing through it? You have to keep chasing it down. OKRs are a great diagnostic tool because they tell you something's broken. So, if your OKRs are going sideways, something's broken deeper. There's also the problem with psychological safety. You need your teams to be able to say, "This isn't working. We're doing something else." Instead of just saying, "This isn't working, tell us how to fix it."

(00:34:13):
People are coming to you and saying, "How do we fix this problem?" Something's broken in the company. You're doing something wrong as a leader. You have to think about, if somebody doesn't know what to do and you're like, "Well, I have a strategy. I told you what my strategy is." And they don't know how to make decisions, it means something's wrong with the strategy or you aren't being clear, because the conversation always has two people. There's an old joke that I think about a lot, which is, if during the day you meet one asshole, he's probably an asshole. But if all day long you meet nobody but assholes, you might be the asshole. And I think that's very true. If your entire company's confused, you might be the asshole. You have to think about, how can I get more clear? If people are constantly bringing you little things, it's not because they're scared, it's because you're scary.

(00:35:01):
So, a lot of times your OKRs breaking are speaking to something else happening, and if your OKR process isn't working, then you have to step back and go, "Okay, how far deep do I have to go before I figure out what's wrong with my management team?" And it could be the CEO, but it could actually be some weird group dynamics, and you've got to focus on that. I really love Patrick Lencioni. Five Dysfunctions of a Team is his most famous book, and I would recommend that if you like the fable style book. But it's the same thing. You got to fix things at the top, you got to do your own work, and then everything else runs a little better.

(00:36:40):
If you think back to what most often is the issue, in your experience, is it something at the top? Is it a middle manager doing something wrong? Is it just misunderstanding how to use OKRs? What do you think is usually the issue with OKRs not working well?

Christina Wodtke (00:36:57):
I can repeat everything I said, but instead I'll just say speed. People read, measure what matters. They get their panties in a bunch, they get really excited. They're just going to do OKRs for everybody, but they didn't really read the whole thing. You kind of skimmed it and you don't really understand how it works, and so you just implement it. Or you ask your head of HR to implement it, and it gets implemented and everybody's really happy and then they're really sad and then they spit it out. And then you say, "Okay, OKRs don't work." I mean, that's what I see over and over again. Nobody calls me for advice when they are thinking about OKRs. They call me for advice when they've done it in sales, every damn time. 

(00:37:32):
I think it's... What is it, the illusion of knowledge? If I asked you right now, how does a bicycle work, or how does a pen work? You'd be like, "I know how that works." And if you tried to write it out, you couldn't. Well, I couldn't. How does a ballpoint pen work? Okay, there's a spring and there's some ink. I'm not sure. So, really thinking about, how would OKRs work throughout the company, is valuable. So, because you don't have time as a leader, what you should do is just give my book to your best team and say, "We're thinking about OKRs. Can you guys see if it works?" And then three months later, check in with them. "What did you figure out, guys?" Okay. 

(00:38:13):
Because the best team always wants to be better. I love piloting with the best team, but they're still very imbued in your culture, so they'll figure out where OKRs in your culture don't fit. They'll figure out where it's helpful and then they can give it back to you and you have a template, and then you can take it to two more teams, and then you can take it to two more teams. And maybe you adopt it with your management team, little bit by little bit. That's how I tell people to start with OKRs. Just figure out your best multidisciplinary team team and say, "You guys start and let us know."

Lenny (00:38:44):
This might be a good time to talk a little bit more about your book for folks that are actually planning to roll out OKRs or trying to fix their OKRs. Can you just talk about what it is, how to find it, what it's called, anything else.

Christina Wodtke (00:38:54):
Yeah, it's called Radical Focus. I could have called it Guide to OKRs, but I think what's really important is to learn how to focus on the most important things and make them happen. It is a business fable, as they call it, where I tell a story about two startup founders and their struggle to find focus and how OKRs help them. And then the second half, it's the second edition that's out now, it's gotten twice as big because I started working with big companies as well as startups and had to work through, what does it mean when you have a larger company and what struggles they follow? 

(00:39:27):
And so, I think the first part's nice because it's fun to read stories, but I think what's really good about is what you notice, which is when I talk you through this company trying to figure out what their OKRs were, everything became a lot more clear. And I think that's one of the powers of stories, is seeing an example. And then the rest of it is really like you could almost open it to any page and look at your problem, go, "Oh my problem's with strategy or my problem's with tasks versus outcomes." And you could flip around and figure out, what's the piece I need to solve?

Lenny (00:39:57):
And folks can find it on Amazon if they search for Radical Focus?

Christina Wodtke (00:39:59):
It's everywhere, baby. 

Lenny (00:40:01):
Okay, great. 

Christina Wodtke (00:40:01):
And it's been translated into eight languages, which is pretty cool.

Lenny (00:40:05):
Wow. Which one's your most favorite language it's been translated into?

Christina Wodtke (00:40:08):
Well, Chinese, because it sells like crazy because apparently some Chinese actress said she loved it and then it's been selling bigger there than anywhere else.

Lenny (00:40:17):
So, Chinese actresses using OKRs, what is going on?

Christina Wodtke (00:40:21):
Mind blown. Once again, life is always more surprising than anything you can imagine.

Lenny (00:40:25):
I have more questions I want to ask you about OKRs, but you were talking about storytelling and fables and things like that. So, you also wrote a book about, not that we're going to go through all your books, but you wrote a book about drawing and the power of drawing, and also you just believe in storytelling as a really powerful tool. So, I'd love to hear just your take on why storytelling is so powerful and why skilled drawing is so important for product leaders at the [inaudible 00:40:48].

Christina Wodtke (00:40:48):
I think there are some things that are fundamentally human that are built into our genes. Storytelling's one. If all of human history was a clock, we started writing things down at 11:00 PM, so most of human history has been an oral tradition where we told each other stories to help pass on knowledge. And so, don't get anywhere near the big kitty with the great big teeth because you will die, or don't eat those red berries because my grandfather threw up for three days and then croaked. But we tell them better than that. Longer stories tend to have more conflicts and they tend to be seen as having more information. So, if you use storytelling, you're talking to the most ancient part of the human brain and you will get attention, you'll get comprehension and you'll get retention. The teacher's Holy Trinity, right?. So, I love stories. They work well, they catch people's attention.

(00:41:38):
And one thing I read that kind of blew my mind was, they said that if you tell people a bunch of facts, they'll forget most of them, especially those that don't fit into their current mental model of how the world works. But if you tell them a story that's full of facts, they will remember it. And if you look at TED, everybody loves a TED Talk. They're mostly all just stories, and facts sprinkled inside those stories. So, I think stories are very powerful. I think images are very powerful. Words are very abstract. If I say the word chair, what pops into your brain? Was it a big easy chair? Was it a hard wooden chair? We use these words as if everybody knows what we're talking about, but people don't. 

(00:42:22):
So, in my time in industry, because I was at, what, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Zynga, MySpace, stuff like that, I just found if I got on the whiteboard and drew really badly, and I think it's almost important to draw badly, make some marks, make some squares. Somebody else will go, "No, no, no, it doesn't work that way. Give me this pen," and start doing it. And it gets you so fast to a shared vision of what's going on. I know designers spend all this time making wireframes and I'm like, that's the lamest use of time ever. Just get some whiteboards, go into the room with your engineers and start making some marks together and that just works better. 

(00:42:56):
And I found that for some reason in America, people seem to think that you have to be one of the chosen few and born a drawer. But it's like anything, it's like playing piano, you just got to practice a little bit. So, the book mostly just has some really simple things you can draw, and then it tells you how to use them in business. So, I wanted to make something that was even simpler than Back of the Napkin, which is an awesome book, but gets pretty intense, pretty quickly.

Lenny (00:43:22):
With the storytelling piece, I feel like most people are like, "Yes, I know storytelling is powerful." But they don't know how to do it. Is there one tip you could share? Just how to get a little bit better at storytelling or integrate storytelling into your work as a product leader or founder?

Christina Wodtke (00:43:37):
If you say one tip, you're really holding me down. I would say-

Lenny (00:43:41):
You could do two tips if that makes it easier.

Christina Wodtke (00:43:43):
... when you finish telling a story, if you're telling it to someone you can trust, say, "What's something I could have done to make the story better?" You're going to find out, do I just blather on forever, or do I not give enough details? I mean, if you're only going to do one thing, get feedback, is always the answer. The second tip would be structurally there's a beginning, middle, and end. Intrigue people with a hook, a mystery. That's the beginning, right? A mystery, a secret, a surprise. The middle is, you can tell them a little bit about it. That's where you get your message in. If you're trying to pitch something, sneak your product in, whatever. And the end is always going to be success and celebration because you're trying to get people excited about your story or remember this information. So, just a basic structure in your head really, can kind of make a big difference.

Lenny (00:44:29):
Yeah, I love that. That's such a actionable, straightforward tactic for getting better, just ask people, "How could this have been a better story?" Great idea. Your second piece made me think about the Minto Pyramid. Do you know much about, do you work with that at all? The Minto Pyramid principle?

Christina Wodtke (00:44:45):
I had a Minto binge for a little while, but I moved onto other stuff. I do.

Lenny (00:44:45):
I think it was a triangle. 

Christina Wodtke (00:44:45):
Yes, but I can't recount it to you. I do remember it.

Lenny (00:44:54):
I was just going to ask because it's kind of the reverse concept, which is, you start with the conclusion and then you kind of share how you got there.

Christina Wodtke (00:45:01):
I think that's a good one. I mean, if you think about what's the job of a hook, a hook just gets you excited. So, how do you get people excited? You can start with a conclusion. There's going to be success. Oh, tell me more. I want to be successful. It could be a mystery. Ooh, what's happening there? I want to be part of that. It could be a secret. Something happened and I'm not going to tell anybody else, but I'm going to tell you. There's so many ways to hook people in, but they're all doing the same job because you want people to actually listen to you and not pretend and nod. So, I think you can do it backwards as well. But I bet even when Barbara Minto did it, she probably opened with a success and ended with a success, I would bet good money, to remind people that there's a happy ending and the story's worth following.

Lenny (00:45:42):
That's a really interesting perspective because to me, there were opposites of build tension and you reveal the answer. The Minto approach is start with the answer. Here's what we're going to do and here's why, and here's all the work I did to get there. Your point is, that's also really interesting. You're like, "Oh wow. I don't know how you got to that."

Christina Wodtke (00:45:56):
There's so many ways to tell a story. Just don't bore your users.

Lenny (00:46:00):
Great advice. Okay, I want to come back to a couple more OKR questions. It could be less fun than the story maybe, but hopefully more useful. I want to just get your take on what is the cadence of a healthy OKR process? What are the ceremonies and meetings and emails that are involved? I know you have this kind of weekly status email practice. Do you recommend... How do you describe the system of an OKR process?

Christina Wodtke (00:46:23):
Oh my gosh, I'm glad you asked because I think the cadence is probably the single most valuable piece of it. So, every Monday, because Monday is a great temporal landmark, look at your week, and you go, "Okay, what am I going to do to move the ball forward?" And it could be an email to your boss, it could be an email to your accountability group, could be an email out to your team, could be standing there like standup. I mean, it's very easy. OKR rituals were built on agile rituals. So, there's a lot of connections there, which is great. 

(00:46:52):
So, you just, Mondays you commit and Fridays you celebrate. People do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, "Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations. And oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better." The simple act of getting together and saying, "What was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week? What's the most awesome thing that happened in marketing? What's the most awesome thing that design did this week?" It makes people feel like they're part of something really special and it's super exciting. 

(00:47:25):
So, you have these [inaudible 00:47:26] bookends and I think if you only do that, you're probably in good shape. I think status emails, I hated them so profoundly for most of my life. I had this huge team at MySpace and my project manager would gather everybody's status emails and put them together into this giant status email that I had to send to my boss. And I was so busy, I just sent it forward figuring it was fine. And then I read it and there was this really bad thing in my status email that should not have happened.

(00:47:51):
I was like, "Fuck." And I waited to hear back from my boss, and nothing. Apparently he wasn't reading them either. So, I was like, "What's the point of the stupid thing?" And then when I was at Zynga, we were using OKRs and they were really short. They were like, "What's your confidence level on your key results? What did you do last week? And what are you doing next week?" And the last week, next week is great because it allows you to start noting down what stops you from getting shit done. And that, I got to say, there's so much learning in that. I tried to do this, but what? Did I get sick? Did somebody get mad at me? Did somebody not want to work with me? Do we not have this critical database? The whole, I tried to do this last week and I failed, learning goes through the roof.

(00:48:38):
And that rhythm of just having three P1s, you can't have more than three P1s. You can have as many P2s as you want and P3s if you really think you should, but you can scam it... scam it. You can skim it, right? Go through it really quickly. And we would all send them to emails. You could subscribe to email lists, which meant I could read the status emails of most of the company, and I would know what was going on and I could quickly see who should I go over and talk to, and who should I make a connection with? So, those emails were invaluable. I think a lot of my clients are doing it in Slack now instead. And that works really well, if you have this place where you're putting your status in and people will quickly go, skim, skim, skim, skim. "Oh, okay. I got to talk to that guy." So, it's hyper valuable.

Lenny (00:49:20):
If you assume others, the OKR doc, you're like, "Here's our outcomes for the quarter. Here's our three key results." You make that plan once a quarter. You have any recommendation how long to spend on planning your OKR?

Christina Wodtke (00:49:32):
My goal is always as little as possible. Time you're planning is not the time you're shipping, and the best is the enemy of the good. So, in an ideal world, you would grade your OKRs week at the end of the quarter, maybe second to the last week of the quarter, depending on it. If it takes you a whole week to set OKRs, which I hope it doesn't, but who knows. And then the very last week you set your OKRs for the next quarter and that's it. 

Lenny (00:49:58):
Cool. 

Christina Wodtke (00:49:59):
Boom. If you can do it at in a... usually you can do it in four days total, unless you have a very hierarchal, huge deep bench. And even then, I have something, I'm going to share this with you because I don't think many people talk about this. The approval process will kill you. I've seen it happen over and over again. I was working with one of my clients and we came up with this different kind of approval process that's working really well, is that basically instead of having your boss approve it, you write your OKRs, you get three... I'm a big fan of the rule of three, because I'm a storyteller, but you could do less or more, I guess, teams that work with you enough to know what you're up to, to look them over and they just look them over, 24 hour turnaround. 

(00:50:43):
They say, "This looks right, but I don't think this is possible." They give you that feedback and you're done. That's it. That's the entire approval process, and it's so fast and it works so well. And that means you might have to say no to somebody if they're asking you to do more than... if you had 10 teams asking you to look over their OKRs, you have to say no. You want to keep it down to a reasonable number, but if you do one a day, it could be done in a week.

Lenny (00:51:09):
I'm thinking about companies the size of Airbnb when I left, trying to do it that quickly. And it's hard to imagine, partly because there's top level strategy that has to align with individual team roadmaps and dependencies, and platform teams and things like that. So, I imagine it's hard to do as the company's scales. I like the drive to make it a week and be done.

Christina Wodtke (00:51:29):
Well, I mean, who really has to approve it and what does it cost you if you get it wrong? And so, if tech looked at it, if somebody from strategy looked at it, if somebody from sales looked at it, whatever, the right people looked at it, you're probably fine. And if you're not right, you'll figure it out over the quarter and do better next quarter. We have to let go or we will get mired down in all this crap.

Lenny (00:51:57):
I love that. I went off track, but just to kind of put a ribbon on the concept of OKRs, you have this document with your object, your outcomes, your key results, and then your recommendation is do a weekly email. And is the idea everyone on the team sends this weekly email or Slacks to the rest of the team?

Christina Wodtke (00:52:15):
To the rest of the company if you can.

Lenny (00:52:18):
Wow. Okay. [inaudible 00:52:19].

Christina Wodtke (00:52:19):
That's the thing, is Google, even as a huge company, everybody's OKRs and their weekly updates are on their intranet. You can look stuff up, so why not?

Lenny (00:52:28):
Got it. And we'll link to a template that you have on your blog post. And also I think in the book, I imagine you have this template of what it is, but essentially it's your confidence level of hitting your OKR, what you did last week, what you're going to do next week.

Christina Wodtke (00:52:40):
And then a few notes if you need to.

Lenny (00:52:42):
Does this replace stand-ups in your experience?

Christina Wodtke (00:52:45):
It could. I never try to tell engineering how to get their shit done, but if they felt like it was doing the same job, then they could combine them.

Lenny (00:52:56):
Cool. Okay, great. And is there anything else? Is this the whole OKR process, in your experience?

Christina Wodtke (00:53:01):
The only other thing I would bring up is thinking about the word grading. So, a lot of people think about trying to make something really numerical, like 0.08, I got 80% of the way there, but a lot of times they're qualitative. So, how do you think about that getting approved by the product committee? So, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Don't get fussy. Don't try to make it really precise. Just go ahead and say, "Ah, hand wave, hand wave, 80%." What matters is, why 80%? Really focus on the learning. So, we almost got there. Well, if we would've gotten there, if we got two more days, that's fine. We basically got there. We knew what we were doing. If we didn't, if we were really far away, what went wrong? 

(00:53:44):
It's all about the retrospectives. Make sure your grading is secondary to retrospective, is the biggest thing I would say, because that's what's going to be valuable. And you could spend so many hours trying to come up with some fake measurement system that never is quite accurate and just wastes everybody's time when you could just be faster. I'm just obsessed with speed. You may have noticed that.

Lenny (00:54:03):
I thought it was 70%, is that 80% is success? Is that the rule of thumb for OKRs?

Christina Wodtke (00:54:07):
It's about 70%. Some people do 80%, some people do 0.075, I don't know. My feeling is, a good goal is one that makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable but not doomed. You're like, "Woo, that's kind of good, that's going to be tricky. Okay, let's go for it." That's about where I like to land with a key result.

Lenny (00:54:29):
I had a newsletter post with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he made this point that OKRs were created by Google, which is the most incredible business model in history. They just print money, and for them it's okay not to hit their goals, like 70% of goal is fine, it'll be fine, we're making so much money. And so, his perspective for most companies, it doesn't make sense to set the goal to be like 70% of this goal you set is a success. Do you have a perspective on that?

Christina Wodtke (00:54:57):
I think you'll never know what you're capable of unless you try to do something that you're not sure you can do.

Lenny (00:55:01):
I agree. I find setting more ambitious goals than you think you can immediately achieve actually really pushes you to achieve them.

Christina Wodtke (00:55:08):
And the literature agrees. There's a lot of literature that shows ambitious goals are actually quite motivating unless you feel you're doomed, at which point then they're demotivating.

Lenny (00:55:16):
I've seen that too. Okay, two more OKR questions. One is, I noted this from before so I'm just going to come back to it. There's a balance with key results of, as you've talked about, being very precise and metrics-driven and focused. And then there's, you talked a bit about sometimes it's okay for them to be a little fuzzy, like quality and delight, and those latter ones are harder to measure, it's hard to keep people accountable. Do you have any advice for just how to find that right balance of, this is what will keep you accountable, and this is how we drive the business forward, and this is how we know you're doing a good job, versus here's a general thing that we think is success and it's fine. Do your best.

Christina Wodtke (00:55:57):
Yeah. One of the most common arguments I have with my friends is I think everything can be measured to a certain degree. Not precisely necessarily, but you can get enough of a swag to be useful. So, by trying to measure things, you'll start learning how to measure things. So, you maybe try NPS and you're like, "Wow, this is not actually accurate, or weird, or not." There's a lot of stuff we don't know until we try them. And of course, my background is in lean and agile and design and they're all iterative. They're all about, let's try something and then learn something and then do something. Which is why I'm so fanatically iterative. So, I think that when you got these fuzzy things, you just got to start trying out ways to measure it and trust the team to be able to figure out whether it's working or not.

(00:56:46):
Revenue, it's easy. This is what we're making now, this is what we could be making. Or you're not making anything now, so you can look up some numbers from public companies or whatnot. That's easy. DAU, it's easy. Acquisition numbers, it's easy. But when it comes to will people stay, do people actually like this? That's harder, but it's not impossible. There's a lot of user researchers who have worked hard to figure out how to measure it.

(00:57:15):
So, you can either buy the obvious off-the-rack package like an NPS, or you can dig a little harder and figure out what would be meaningful to your company. And I think there's a desire not to do things that are hard and take a little bit longer, but that's where you're going to get the super value. That's how you become the next Netflix or Amazon or whatnot. So, you really got to say, "How will we know about our product and what are the approaches are out there and which one makes sense for us?"

Lenny (00:57:47):
Final OKR-related question. Say someone's listening to this and they're like, "Wow, this is awesome. I want to do this at our company, we have a focus problem, we have alignment problems, we need to be more clear about what we're working on." Other than buying your book and reading it and sharing with everyone, what would you recommend would be the first few steps to work along that journey to rolling out an OKR process at the company?

Christina Wodtke (00:58:09):
I hate to say this, but there are a lot of consultants that have popped out of nowhere and it's kind of terrifying because so many of them really, really suck and they're just like, "Oh, OKR sounds like SMART goals or whatever, I'll just use that." Or it's hot, and so I'm going to figure it out by reading some articles. And so, I would ask for references. I think that's a good one.

Lenny (00:58:33):
So, your advice is find someone to come in and help you figure out how to do this well and find the right person.

Christina Wodtke (00:58:40):
Yeah, I guess I think that finding someone to coach you is really high value, but I also think it would be okay if you just read a book or read a bunch of blog posts and start experimenting. It's not rocket science. You just listened to this podcast, listen to it again. Take lots of notes, Google around, see if you can learn a little more about some of the concepts that you didn't fully understand or you want to know more about. And then just run a tiny pilot and say, "Okay, what does this mean for us?" You don't even have to call them OKRs. You can just try, "We're going to do a outcome focus this quarter and let's see where it takes us." But just try it because that's where you learn stuff. And try it at a small, safe level where you don't think it's going to hurt too many things.

Lenny (00:59:25):
And you said to start with a high performing team. 

Christina Wodtke (00:59:27):
Oh, yes.

Lenny (00:59:28):
[inaudible 00:59:28] point.

Christina Wodtke (00:59:28):
Because they're smart, they're capable, and if anybody's going to figure out how to make it work, they will. If you try to fix a bad team with OKRs, you'll make everybody hate OKRs and make the bad team worse. So, just don't do that. It's not a medicine, but that high preferring team, they're going to be the ones who go, "Oh, well, okay, our stand-up's like this, so we should add this to standup. And then instead of emails, let's just have a brag channel on our..." I've seen people do the coolest stuff with OKRs, totally changing what I recommend, doing wonderful things with it, just because they're smart and they messed with it till it worked.

Lenny (01:00:03):
Awesome. Final question in topic. You teach product management at Stanford. What's maybe a surprising or contrarian opinion about how to learn to do product management, how to get into product management, how to do product management, from your experience teaching young PMs?

Christina Wodtke (01:00:22):
I taught it and a bunch of students who thought they were going to be product managers realized that they wanted to be interaction designers and not product managers at all. I think one of the things that might be off with a lot of the product management education and conferences is, it's good that they take a lot from UX and it is important to be people-centered, but the reality is the product manager serves the business. That's their role. Teresa Torres talks about the product trio, right? Trio.

Lenny (01:00:52):
Trio.

Christina Wodtke (01:00:53):
Trio. She's talking about business and user experience and technology. So, if product's over here messing with the user experience or products over there, messing with engineering, who's taking care of the business? And I think it's absolutely critical product managers, they say they're the mini CEO, but that just means they want to be in charge and nobody's in charge. It's all about working together as a team. So, they need to understand business models, they need to understand how to do a target market, and what is a target market, why is that target market the right one to go after, and how is it going to grow, and what are the trends that are going on that's going to change the business? 

(01:01:29):
Product managers need to serve the business and it's not a bad thing. If you have a company, it needs to survive and all money is, is oxygen, it lets the company keep going, unless people are being greedy assholes, which definitely happens. But it's okay to care about the health and well-being of the company's ability to make money and feed itself. And don't do anything unethical, but really focus on these questions. And if you don't know business models, if you can't talk about why you might want to do a subscription or if you want to just do one-off sales, if you don't understand why you know have all these in-app purchases in your mobile devices, go learn it. I'm really shocked at how many product managers are just smart people who care about users and just showed up and said, "Yes, I will be a product manager." So, no, business is a real thing. It has a long history of knowledge and understanding, and go do that.

Lenny (01:02:30):
What I'm hearing is, maybe product sense is overrated in your experience.

Christina Wodtke (01:02:34):
Ain't none of them yet old enough to have product sense. I mean, seriously. Product sense is intuition, intuition is compressed experience, compressed experience comes from having lots of experience. And if you're young and you don't have a lot of experience, the smartest thing you could do is learn. You've got to learn what models work and why they work, and just intuition is overvalued and under-exists.

Lenny (01:03:01):
Imagine that's kind of freeing to a lot of people listening, where they're like, "Man, I just don't know if I have product sense. How do I learn product?" All this. Yeah, don't worry about it is what you're saying. Any other advice for just people thinking about getting into product or trying to get into product other... Many can't get to Stanford and learn product from someone like you. What else would you suggest they do to try to help them get into a product management role? What other activities or areas they should spend time, in your experience?

Christina Wodtke (01:03:30):
I think I agree with my friend Ken Norton on this, in that you shouldn't probably start in product. Go be an engineer or be a designer, work, get to know businesses. And I got into product from, well, I was a developer and then I was a designer, and both of those gave me a lot of knowledge. But when I moved into product, it came out of my startup where I had to learn business, and I absolutely had to learn business or else I wasn't surviving. So, I would say work for a company that's small enough that you can poke into the corners and learn from other people, and learn and then do stuff. 

(01:04:11):
I don't know, it's funny because I'm at Stanford, which is all fancy with a degree and stuff and I'm like, "No, no, no, just read up, go hang out with people, get a job, figure it out." Because that's very much how I did it. And I think that if people want to get into product, I'd ask, "Why? Why do you want to be in product? Do you want to be in charge?" I learned that nobody's in charge. No matter what you do, you have to use your influence, you have to use your people skills. 

(01:04:34):
Are you willing to work on your interpersonal dynamics? Because if you can't fire someone, if you can't tell somebody their behavior is interfering with the ability to get things done, don't be a product manager. If you can't solve the fight between two of your coworkers, don't be a product manager. If you can't go out and talk to somebody in a Starbucks line and say, "Hey, we're working on this new thing, what do you think?" Don't be a product manager. You got to have hustle. You got to talk to people. You got to always have your eye on the bottom line.

(01:05:00):
Maybe you don't want to be a product manager. Maybe it's much more fun to leave work every day at 6:00 and be a designer and think about how all the systems work and how and where the error message is going to come in, and is blue the right color, all the combinations of that, that's fun. Or you really want to be an engineer and solve puzzles all day. Product manager is probably the worst job unless you love talking to everybody and connecting them and stepping into the mess.

Lenny (01:05:24):
I definitely agree. There's not enough talk about how painful and hard the PM role is and how thankless it often is.

Christina Wodtke (01:05:29):
And I love it, but I love everything. I fell in love with the web and I haven't stopped, even though it's now mostly on phones and stuff. It's an exciting space. But yeah, you got to step up and do the hard stuff.

Lenny (01:05:42):
That is an awesome way to end it. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I just have six quick questions. I don't know if you know they are, so let's just go through them and see how it goes. Are you ready?

Christina Wodtke (01:05:53):
I love it.

Lenny (01:05:54):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Christina Wodtke (01:05:59):
The Fearless Organization. I think that book on psychological safety is the bomb. It's so, so, so good. For fiction, I loved The Overstory. It's about trees, and it's mind-blowing and so good. I'm going to leave it at that. Less is better.

Lenny (01:06:17):
I tried reading The Overstory and it's very long, but beautiful.

Christina Wodtke (01:06:20):
It's a lot like Cloud Atlas. If you liked Cloud Atlas, you'll like The Overstory.

Lenny (01:06:24):
I think I watched that movie.

Christina Wodtke (01:06:25):
No, a terrible movie. Only read the book.

Lenny (01:06:28):
I agree. Speaking of movies, what's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Christina Wodtke (01:06:33):
We just saw Wakanda Forever and it's a very different movie than Black Panther, and my kid and I spent quite a bit of time talking about it and what it meant and it was a lot deeper than I expected. And I'm very passionate about the Mayan people because I live in Belize part of the year, and I don't know, the Mayans are just the OGs of everything, invented zero, writing. They're just so amazing.

Lenny (01:06:56):
Love it. Next question, favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people.

Christina Wodtke (01:07:01):
What questions should I have asked you? I've been using that one forever, whether I am interviewing somebody or being interviewed, because the person is an expert in themselves. And if you say, "What question should I have asked you?" A lot of times they'll be like, "Oof." They'll be knocked off-base and then they'll give you a really honest answer.

Lenny (01:07:20):
What are five SaaS products or tools that you just love and use constantly?

Christina Wodtke (01:07:24):
Oh, I hate all technology. That's what the problem is, if you've been a product manager and a designer, all you can see is the flaws. But I would say I like Zoom better than you might think. It's terrible, but it's better than everything else. Slack, when I saw it, I was like, "This is not going to get rid of email. This is just going to be another channel of nonsense." And that showed up. But I do use it. God knows, I use it. 

(01:07:48):
The Google Suites, I got to say the Google Suite is pretty amazing. Most people think that the students who go to Stanford are all rich, but 70% of them have huge amounts of financial aid. And so, I'm always looking for things that are free and won't cost too much for these students. So many of them are first generation, the first student who's gone in their family here. So, having the Google Suite and being able to have free slides, free docs, everything interconnected, Drive is sort of a gift. So, I've got to say I love those.

Lenny (01:08:20):
Cool. I didn't expect the question to go in that direction, but I love it. Two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've seen a company you've worked with change in their product development process that's had a tremendous impact on their ability to execute and ship crates?

Christina Wodtke (01:08:35):
I will never forget when people stopped sitting with their disciplines and started sitting with their teams. I think that we in tech want everything to be tech and be remote and everything, blah, blah, blah. And there are definitely jobs that are wonderful remote, but if you're trying to innovate, there's nothing like getting the product trio to sit together, and preferably with walls. Walls are really underrated. If you can just give them a war room where they can put stuff on the wall, or I hate to say it, cubicles, I'd rather see offices, but if you can give people walls, it becomes part of your memory. And then you're not using your short-term memory to remember stuff. You're using it to think, and so the war room becomes a living memory so you can make connections. I mean, it's one of the hardest things I have to teach my students too, is that some things are just better done analog and that's okay.

Lenny (01:09:27):
Reminds me of a story I just heard from a friend where there was a team sitting next to a data science team and they were one table apart. They're right next to each other. And the data team just had a lot of concerns with what that team was building. They didn't believe in what they're doing and they're just like, "Why are we wasting these resources on this thing?" And the head of data science put one of the data people on the team and had them sit just one table over with the team and everything changed. They're just like, "Okay, let's do this. This is great. We're going to build some awesome products." 

Christina Wodtke (01:09:55):
We're human.

Lenny (01:09:56):
Just that one move.

Christina Wodtke (01:09:58):
We are human. We are social. Yeah, and I think moving people around every year or so, everybody hates it. Nobody wants to change desks, but do it to them anyway. It always makes things better.

Lenny (01:10:07):
Final question. What's a company that you think has a really strong and effective product culture? If you can name one, if not, that's okay too. 

Christina Wodtke (01:10:14):
Well, I think of all my clients, the best cultures all seem to be very small companies working in strange little corners of the world. They're not the big, sexy guys. Everybody's there because they want to make dog food or they want to make this kind of financial software, and they're amazing. I think we treat scale like it's a virtue when it's merely a tactic, and it might be a bad tactic as well. So yeah, I think there's something really sweet around 250 people working on something that everybody agrees is important.

Lenny (01:10:49):
Christina, I honor you as emperor for life of OKRs. 

Christina Wodtke (01:10:54):
Woo.

Lenny (01:10:54):
You've achieved it. I'm very proud of you. I think we've made a big dent in how people perceive OKRs and will utilize OKRs. 

Christina Wodtke (01:10:54):
I hope so.

Lenny (01:11:03):
Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Christina Wodtke (01:11:10):
If they want to learn more, I've been blogging at eleganthack.com, like a hack writer since 2000. It's where I've dumped my thoughts for a long time, so it's always a good place if you want to go spelunking about anything. If you want to attempt to hire me, cwodtke.com is not a bad place to go. I say attempt because I teach, and so I don't have a lot of time. But you know what users could do? Users could slow down. I just wish everybody would take a deep breath and think about, "Okay, we're going to adopt this thing. Let's read up on it. Let's think about it. Oh, we're going to build this new product? Let's do a literature review, let's do a competitive analysis. Let's see what's been done. Let's learn from the past."

(01:11:55):
I think if you could slow down, you'll end up going a lot faster. So, I would encourage people, if you're in a panic and you're in a tizzy, and I know the economics bad and the world's on fire, but just take some deep breaths before you do anything and just ask yourself, "What's a good way to do it? What's a good way for me to move forward?" I think I would like to encourage that.

Lenny (01:12:16):
A beautiful way to end it, but I also want to make sure you plug your books. Just say the titles of your books and where people can find them, and then we'll [inaudible 01:12:24].

Christina Wodtke (01:12:23):
Radical Focus. Get the second edition. The Team That Managed Itself. And Pencil Me In. Those are my three books that are out there right now. You can get them pretty much anywhere I do believe, but definitely, I mean Amazon. Amazon rules us all, so they're definitely there.

Lenny (01:12:40):
Amazing. Christina, again, thank you for being here. We'll all go slow down right now.

Christina Wodtke (01:12:44):
Thank you so much for having me here, Lenny, and sharing your audience with me. It's been an honor.

# Understanding the role of product ops | Christine Itwaru (Pendo)

## Transcript

Christine Itwaru (00:00:00):
Speaking as a former PM, I would not ever give up spending time with customers and watching their pain. That's how I fell in love with product was I saw my internal customer 12 years back now fighting with the keyboard, fighting with the mouse, and I was just like, "Oh, my gosh. What's this guy doing?"
Lenny (00:00:23):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Christine Itwaru. Christine is a long-time product ops leader at Pendo, a role that she transitioned into from product management. I've been hearing more and more about the rise of product ops and I've never really understood what the role was until I have this conversation with Christine. 
(00:00:49):
We dig into what product ops people do day to day, where the line is between their role and product management, whether you should consider getting into the role, whether your company would benefit from product ops. We also have an interesting discussion around whether ops roles in general are a sign of inefficiency at your company. I learned a ton from this conversation and Christine is awesome. So, with that, I bring you Christine Itwaru after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Christine Itwaru (00:02:37):
Thank you. I'm so happy to be here, Lenny.
Lenny (00:02:39):
First of all, I just wanted to give a big thank you to Ben Williams who is a previous guest on this podcast who suggested you join this podcast and who connected us. We were chatting earlier and you said you have a story about Ben. So, what is that? 
Christine Itwaru (00:02:51):
I do. Absolute thanks to Ben for connecting us. So, when he made the intro, I was super excited, one because it's you, and two, because I love hearing from Ben. I was like, "Oh, great, he's doing all these wonderful things and whatnot." I just remember in that moment, my first conversation with Ben, which was really early in the days of starting product operations at Pendo and we were going through all these just really crazy things that he was going through and his team was a customer of Pendo at the time. He's sitting there just staring and I was like, "Oh, you're okay?" He was like, "Yeah, I'm fine. I thought that I was just throwing them off at every return." 
(00:03:28):
He said to me, "I bet you I'm not the only person who has these questions and I bet you I'm not the only person that's thinking about all these problems that probably seem very normal and natural." I don't know. All of us are going through this. This is why I'm building product ops here. But what he said and he was just like, "I really think there are a lot more people that you need to talk to about this stuff." It's just full circle. I think he connected us and he was one of the reasons I started to say... One of the best things that my first boss product always told me was, "You have to find a way to give back." When he said that to me, I was like, "I wonder if this is one of the ways that I can start to give back to the product community."
Lenny (00:04:08):
Awesome. Well, here we are, and obviously, we're going to be talking about product ops. You've been in the product ops role for seemingly feels like as long as the role has existed. I'd love to know when you think the role actually and we're going to talk about just when this spurred happened in product ops. I hate this term, but it feels like you're a thought leader in the product ops space. I've never actually worked with anyone in product ops. I've never had a product ops team, so I have a ton of questions. I imagine many people listening also have and are also just curious about this emerging role. 
(00:04:38):
So, what I'm hoping we do with our chat is to help people understand, "Do they need a product ops team? Would that be beneficial to their company? Whether people should be consider moving into product ops, whether they're in PM or something else right now, and then just generally helping people understand this emerging role of product ops." Does that sound good? 
Christine Itwaru (00:04:56):
Yes, thank you, number one. That was really kind. Two, yeah, I'm happy to dive in. Yeah. 
Lenny (00:05:01):
Okay, sweet. So, I think we have to start with the basics. What's just the simplest way to understand the role of product ops, especially in relation to product management? 
Christine Itwaru (00:05:11):
I've had many ways of describing this in the past and it generally centered around the ladder of what I'm going to tell you or the second part of this, but I'm breaking it down now into two simple things. One is it is a thing you do. Product operations for a VP or a head of product or a product manager is the creation of some system that allows you to thrive or allows your team to thrive in product management. The second is what we've seen more of over the last couple years, and it's the more common definition. 
(00:05:44):
The emergence of the role itself is why it's so common. It's a person or the people, the group of individuals who are strong partners to the product manager and then for more mature product ops teams end up people being more strategic advisors to the head of products. So, your CPO or your VP again. When it comes to data, qualitative, quantitative, anything that they feel can help the CPO or the head of product make more strategic decisions and well-informed decisions. 
Lenny (00:06:11):
Got it. It feels like there's been this big inflection and emergence of the role in the past couple years, past few years. I'm curious what you think triggered that and if that's true, if it feels like it's just emerged in the last couple years and then just like why do you think that has happened? 
Christine Itwaru (00:06:28):
This is interesting, because as a former product manager and product leader, I don't think that things are new. Absolutely. When I go back to the story about Ben, I'm like, "No, none of this stuff feels really interesting and it's just stuff that we had to deal with in product." So, the problems have always been there. I think maybe that is because I have a product background. So, I felt that pain very acutely, but I will say for the majority of people I always speak to who don't have that product background, they're coming from consulting or from technical success or from some other group marketing maybe, it does feel relatively new because they're starting to dive into that space a little bit. 
(00:07:06):
But I will say that for me in particular at Pendo, it was the summer of 2019 that this really picked up and I remember a colleague of mine, shout out to Shannon. He's no longer with us, but he is one of the original people on the Pendo product team. He said, "I think this is the summer of the birth of product ops." I just started laughing and he was like, "I'm telling you, it's everywhere." All of a sudden, everybody's just like, "We need something. We need to make product better." I thought that was awesome because we had already started talking about it. 
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]So, it took me a bit to understand what was going on across tech that was making this thing so big. I'm very grateful because we have so many great customers that reach out and say, "Help us understand how you're doing this." I'm like, "Well, help me understand what's going on." So, for me, it went beyond the problems that we would solve as a product team with the Pendo product. It went into, "How can we help you as an organization solve pain that you're feeling within your product team that trickles out to the business?" 
Lenny (00:08:07):
That's interesting. That was the summer of product ops. What happened there? Why was there a summer of product ops? Why was everyone starting to get excited and creating product ops teams? 
Christine Itwaru (00:08:17):
Yeah, I'll dive in. The customers started to come up and we started to feel it a bit more and I felt like there was this huge need for a voice of customer management and synthesis of both this qualitative and quantitative data as a theme that I saw arising across our customer base or even just folks that were reaching out about this role as they saw Pendo was putting it down. There was a lot of pain around internal alignment in general, transparency to stakeholders up across your revenue team members. Then for a lot of people during this time, growth was a massive propeller of the need for product ops. I remember just sitting here in this office and getting these random... 
(00:08:58):
Every industry almost was like, "Yeah, I'm thinking about doing this and I really need to do this, the pandemic, blah, blah, blah." Because it was growth during the pandemic, especially within industries such as home furnishings and making their living space a whole lot better. All of a sudden, we started to see that rise, but we were all experiencing this massive amount of growth across some of these startups and really rapidly growing companies. We're also moving more towards these product-led tactics, product-led growth. All of these things I feel like made this perfect storm for product operations to come in and start calming things down. 
(00:09:34):
I personally believe there's this natural evolution that happens at any mature function when it starts to grow in an industry and across an organization. So, think about marketing or sales. This just started to happen with product managers. For me, I was sitting there going, "Well, you can appoint a PM to liaise with other ops teams and the business, but at what risk?" Their product portfolio, the growth and adoption of their product, all these goals that they have to hit today in order to build a better tomorrow for their customers. So, I feel like that was the moment to say, "Okay, how do we give them the structure that they needed to thrive?" Because the CPO is in charge of so much more than product people have historically been in charge of, right? 
(00:10:17):
I'll probably talk about Marty Cagan several times here. I really do admire and respect him, and I think one of the things that he always talks about is future teams versus high performing teams and focusing on outcomes. CPOs went from deliver, deliver, deliver to really increased business metrics or just help drive the bottom line versus just really look at the product. You really have to figure out what that means for the product team at large. 
Lenny (00:10:45):
Got it. So, the way to think about this role, because I imagine most people haven't ever had a product ops person in their company is there's a slice of the PM role that companies are finding is valuable to put on a different person that has different skillsets that can take this endless load that PMs have. PMs have so many things to do and their job is so full of responsibilities that there's a sliver of stuff that a product ops person can take off. I'd be curious too and feel free to comment on that, but I'm also curious, you mentioned a few specific things that the product ops folks do. 
(00:11:19):
It'd be cool to just go through a bullet list of just those sorts of things, like you said, responsible for voice of the customer, pieces, alignment across stakeholders, whatever. If you could just go through some of those, that makes it really concrete I think for people to understand wow, this person that could have someone do all these for me, that'd be amazing. 
Christine Itwaru (00:11:37):
In some ways, I've got this question a lot from product managers who are concerned about the rise of this role or product leaders who are concerned that it was going to create some controversy or friction between product ops people and product managers. The way I've coached people to get around that is really, "What are your people responsible for? What are you holding them accountable to? Are you holding the product manager accountable to elevating these strategic insights so that they are going to elevate it to everyone else and then everyone else is going to go out there and build thing and drive the value or are you holding them accountable to truly understanding the customer in whatever way possible?" 
(00:12:15):
Especially going on and talking to the customer, please don't let anybody ever take that for granted. Really spending time with their engineers and the customers in order to drive a better experience. So, if they've got to spend all this time, which is our most valuable asset with those two entities, everything else still has to give. So, I think that yes, there was a point of friction, but I feel like now it's been a nice change where I'm seeing people in products saying, "No, I want to do product ops now," who was a former product manager. The second part of that, you said, let's go through the list of tactical things. Yes, voice of customer management is definitely one of the things that we're seeing more... 
(00:12:54):
I don't want to say mature because then I feel like I'm seeing mature of your peak, but the ones who have matured a bit, I feel like they are focusing more on the voice of customer elements. So, quantitative analysis, qualitative, bringing all of these different inputs that would traditionally be handled by product manager through looking across the aisle at their PM or looking at different data sources to the surface when they're going through their product development lifecycle planning, and really figuring out too what that balance is. I think there's an art. You can do voice of customer in two ways. 
(00:13:27):
You can do it one in this process way where you're feeding it to a really mature longstanding product team who has switchboard product or you have this voice of customer thing that you have to do for teams that are actually building something new. They're really trying to move fast, so how do you really get them what they need in order to experiment and iterate on the next thing that they're doing? That's one aspect. Another one is tooling. We see this more for folks who don't yet have tools under control in their product org. I'm not saying everybody has this, right? We had someone at one point handle whatever tools connected to Pendo and make sure that those systems are set up for maximum outcomes for the product manager. 
(00:14:10):
So, Pendo's connected to Salesforce. We're connected to Looker. We're connected to all these different. So, what does the product manager need to achieve out of all those things that ultimately drives our experience for Pendo ourselves? We get very meta here. That person was responsible for that. That's all also a part of the data component. The other things that we're seeing are more of along the lines of content strategy and being really intentional about making content and education a part of the product process and the delivery process. So, taking a look at how they maximize the outcomes from the outcome that the product manager is driving so that they can help increase retention, growth, and all of that good stuff for the product. 
(00:14:57):
So, those are some of the things that we're seeing. Then there's also this component that happens or this piece of it that happens in the beginning when you're standing a product ops for a product team that does not have much process in and that's the process piece. That's the bit that's a bit controversial, because folks are like, "Is this just program management? Is this just a different flavor of agile?" 
(00:15:20):
So, what we're seeing is this, what are these folks doing? Are they managing and facilitating the product development lifecycle? Are they doing things with the rest of the organization? So I feel like this one's a little bit up in the air. Some are actually agile facilitators as well, but I am seeing emergence of some companies that have the program management team under the product's umbrella to help with this massive amount of things that they have to manage across the board. 
Lenny (00:15:49):
Oh, that's a really interesting point on the last piece. I want to dig in on that a little bit just to summarize what you shared. So, some of the key roles of a product ops person, there's this voice of customer element and just to understand what you mean by that. The team is aggregating feedback from customers and feedback from the customer support and sales and things like that and sharing it with the product manager to give them clear conclusions and takeaways so that the PM doesn't have to sit there and filter their data. Is that a way to think about it? 
Christine Itwaru (00:16:19):
That's one part of it. We actually developed this really cool way of doing it here at Pendo, which is the transparency is a word that we love here. What we found that there was just not this need for the revenue org to be transparent and say, "Hey, this is what we're hearing. Product people, please listen," or vice versa. Here's what we're doing for your customer. There was this interesting moment where we realized that our sales team was screaming for something and our success team was screaming for something else, but [inaudible 00:16:46] looking at something else. So, they're all wonderful relevant things that our customers wanted, but we were like, "What if they're aware that they've got all these amazing things and they're talking about it separately?" 
(00:16:59):
Our PMs, they would get the whole readout with us, but we brought those folks in a room together. It was really cool because I think our head of professional services team at one point was like, "Whoa, this could truly impact what we do from an onboarding perspective and now we have this data. Then how do we then strengthen this area and the product?" So, it wasn't just about the components. So, I don't know if other companies are doing it like that, but I was very proud of the way we ended up doing that here. But the PM got risk data, high-priority deals, feedback from our feedback product. What are we hearing from prospects versus paying customers. What segments are saying what? 
(00:17:35):
All that stuff got fed over to the PM and then validated through our research team or disputed through our research team, which was really cool. This is a really good partnership with our research team. But on the other side, what was really nice too was we were able to educate our revenue team on behalf of the product team and say, "Guys, not everything requires a product change." So if you're saying there's customers that have friction around this one area of this product, maybe it's enabling. Maybe it's something that we need to help you guys understand a little bit better so that you can make their experience better or maybe we need to help update. It's just very simple things like that that just ended up coming up this voice of customer process. 
Lenny (00:18:15):
So essentially, it's just finding ways to make the PM more focused and allow them to focus on the things they want to focus on and reduce workload. On the user research piece, so it feels like there's user research coming in. PMs are involved, user research. There's a research team. Where does the product ops team fit in there or is it focused on internal alignment, stakeholder feedback more versus external customer feedback? 
Christine Itwaru (00:18:41):
Yeah. Again, I'll say these probably several times. Every company's doing it in their own little bit of flavor. I'll tell you that here and from a couple companies that I'm seeing outside of Pendo, our user research team sits with our UX team. They report into our head of UX and they are responsible for proactive research and making sure that we are aligning to our strategy and saying, "Okay, here's what our folks are saying. Here's why we're going after this market or this new thing that we're doing. Let's start going out there and validating or checking with some of these key personas and what we need to do." Then they are also a part of the ongoing development process or product development process. 
(00:19:21):
So, testing stuff out, making sure that they're doing user interviews, and all that good stuff. So, they sit as a partner to us. We work very closely together. Again, I'll give you that example of voice of customer, which is we have all of this input coming in from our customer success or post-sales teams and we know we're about to invest in our guides area of the product. We have all of these. What do we do with it? Well, we couple that with I'm personal responsible for NPS or I was for a very long time. I'm seeing a lot of noise around guides. 
(00:19:52):
So, I take all of that, we pull it all together, and we give it to our head of research and say, "All right. Let's all make sense of all this together. Is this something that is in line with the direction that the product team is going, the guides team, or is this something that we're going to need to dig a little bit more into to see if their efforts right now where they're growing are not where there should be going?" 
Lenny (00:20:10):
The other two bullet points, just to make sure I totally understand, you help with tooling. The product ops teams help, just optimize the tooling to build product. Is that a simple way to think about it, just make sure the product development process is efficient? 
Christine Itwaru (00:20:24):
Yeah, we partner with the program management team and the tools that they use for product development stuff. I would say it's more, "What are the things that the product manager needs in order to be successful?" So, we look at Pendo, right? We do use our own product like I mentioned quite a lot. Salesforce is another thing, so how does that all plug into our own product and what data are we looking to get out of there? So, our PMs have a complete picture in Pendo. Tray is another one I mentioned. Zapier was another one that we had used. So, it's more about the PM's tool stack versus the PM's planning tool stack if you want to draw that distinction. 
Lenny (00:20:59):
Got it. Okay. That is helpful. Then content strategy, by that, you mean internal documentation to train sales and customer support or is there also help the product team build out product marketing content and things like that? 
Christine Itwaru (00:21:13):
Neither or a bit. I guess what we have done is fed into both of those technical documentation. We use Zendesk as another tool, so we use Zendesk as another part of our tool stack to support our customers. So, a brand new feature comes out. Natural thing to do, let's write up this thing in Zendesk, but it's also about how we weave education into the product and we use Pendo again. Sorry, that's all right. It's actually really good tool. So, we do use Pendo guides and we just release our NPS themes. So, a pain in my team's butt has been manual labor around NPS themes and qualitative data. So, we designed this experience for customers who are in this beta. So, that they can in the product understand what it is. 
(00:21:59):
Then if they really need more, they can go out to the technical documentation, but it's about the education for the customer. I mentioned earlier treating content is a part of the development lifecycle process. You really want to treat it as a part of definition of done. When you think about product-led growth and the emergence of that in particular over the last couple years, it's all about creating that experience and keeps people in and helps them upgrade. So, they work alongside product marketing to develop these playbooks for what they're doing in app to create less friction and drive more engagement. 
Lenny (00:22:36):
Got it. Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Would it be safe to say that product ops is essentially for B2B companies where there's all these internal stakeholders, sales, customer support, marketing, things like that and that's the work that you can take off the product manager's plate? 
Christine Itwaru (00:22:53):
My personal experience and I think a lot of people would agree with me has led me to believe that's not accurate. It's emerged a lot more in B2B or I think we've seen it a lot more in B2B or at least people talking about it. I'm curious as to why and I wonder if it's because we're sharing because we're all trying to go through this thing together serving each other and then the other is serving the customer. So, it's not like, "Hey, you helped me figure this thing out." I understand I was so lucky and I still am so lucky to work with so many people in my network, in our customer base to help them understand the role or determine whether they even needed this thing or not. 
(00:23:28):
Without calling out names, there were some really big companies in retail and finance and some industries that you would not expect who are B2C, larger, well established companies who we all know and love and maybe not even love. Maybe the experience is bad for us. So, they also do have a lot more cross-functional engagement internally than we would even think of. So, I don't know if it's because we're used to this world and we haven't thought about that side of it, but it's really interesting. I think the common thread is the cross-functional transparency and then transparency out to the customer. 
(00:24:04):
So, I mentioned transparency is a big word for us, but readiness is another one and so readiness means a lot. You have your teams you need to get ready internally, but you really need to get customers ready for something new as well and everybody needs to feel aligned. So, it plays a massive part in what the product manager and the product team needs to consider, advocate for, deliver, and communicate about, I feel like no matter the size or industry. 
Lenny (00:24:28):
I imagine a lot of PMs listening to this have this two minded view right now of on the one hand, somebody could take all his work off my plate. That's awesome. On the other, it's like, "Oh, okay, there's another stakeholder that have loop into every meeting and they're going to be doing this work that's cool and important that I'm not going to get to do anymore." That's weird. What have you found is the best way to convince a PM to this is like, "Wow, this would make your life so much better"?
Christine Itwaru (00:24:54):
Yeah, I go back to that question that I have asked leaders when helping them stand this up, which is what are you looking at your PMs to drive and how are you measuring their success? That generally just helps everybody get on the same page really quickly. I've had customers or I've had folks come to me in the product community that say, "I've tried this and it's just not going anywhere." There's resistance to the role because they feel like it's stepping on too many toes and whatnot. Generally, I will tell you it's because they still have a bit of buying in the top to get done. 
(00:25:32):
I'm seeing that the most successful ones that are drawing the lines and showing that this role is valuable are the people that have their buy-in from their CEO or CPO at that level or their head of product and saying, "Hey, this is what this role means for you." So, I don't want to say it needs to be directive. I do want to say that you need to be able to articulate the value to somebody who's heading up essentially businesses and saying, "Here's what this role is going to drive for you at the end of the day." The very mature product ops end up having people that are strategic advisors too, a product leader. So, once you can show that this is what you'll also get as a result of me and this other person or me and this team doing this, it ends up being an easier conversation. 
Lenny (00:26:17):
What are a couple bullet points that are most effective to convince a product leader product op is going to make a big impact and benefit you and then just an ICPM who's like, "I don't want this person on my team"? What actually works there to get buy-in? 
Christine Itwaru (00:26:31):
Yeah. Number one, do you want your PMs to constantly be fielding questions from your revenue team when they could be spending time with customers? Yeah, you're shaking your head. That one seems to be the one. 
Lenny (00:26:43):
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good one. 
Christine Itwaru (00:26:44):
Yeah, I can count on one hand the companies who have blocked their product managers from speaking to customers and those companies are not product companies. I mean they do not believe in product management. They might say they do, but they don't. So, that's number one. Number two is how are you measuring your outcomes and where are you making this all transparent? Is this happening consistently across the board? So, one probably seeing product teams across so many different places is you might have somebody who's really passionate and really good at doing this stuff for their own vertical and then it doesn't scale. 
(00:27:20):
So, how are you doing this at scale so that your stakeholders are building this trust in you and making sure that they get the best out of the product team at any given turn? I say those are the two bullet points that seem to stick the most is that quality time, giving the PM what they need, which is their time to be able to drive the outcomes for the customer. 
Lenny (00:27:41):
What is it that you think a PM will never offload, if that makes sense? In your perspective, what's like the core of a PM's role versus maybe product ops for now and then maybe potentially other roles that take off some of the stuff on their plate? 
Christine Itwaru (00:27:57):
Speaking as a former PM, I would not ever give up spending time with customers and watching their pain. That sounds really bad to customers. I'm sorry. That's how I fell in love with product was I saw my internal customer 10, 12 years back now fighting with the keyboard, fighting with the mouse. I was just like, "Oh, my gosh. What's this guy doing?" 
(00:28:23):
I think it was an experience that some people might say, "Oh, I never want to be in that situation again because it made me feel very uncomfortable that my product is not doing for this person what it needs to," but for me, it was, "How do I make this thing do what it needs to for this gentleman? How do I make this thing better?" I cannot see product managers saying, "I don't want to be a part of that conversation." Then you know what? I'm going to say it then don't be in product. 
Lenny (00:28:50):
Love it. Yeah. I'm so curious what parts of the role get sliced off over time because I love that. That's the core of it is just build great products that your customers want and use and want to pay for. Then what else can people help you with along the side? Because yeah, PM role is just crazy. There's so many things going on.
Christine Itwaru (00:29:06):
It's crazy how this article that I wrote, I dug into the history of product management and it's like 100 years old not in its current form, but it's about 100 years old and just the evolution of what product managers have historically been responsible for. Then if you think about just really sit down and think about what the world has turned into today and how much noise we have coming at us. We talked about put yourself onto not disturb mode and I learned a long time ago, put myself onto disturb mode. So, imagine having a partner that helps you filter that noise. 
Lenny (00:29:44):
Yeah, quite useful. Along those lines, I was going to go in a different direction, but as you mentioned that, there's all these roles adjacent to PM. There's program managers, project managers, agile product owners, and all and then now product ops. I guess before team has product ops, let me just ask this one straightforward question. Which of those roles generally does the thing that product ops can do for you? Is it the PM or is it one of these other roles? 
Christine Itwaru (00:30:11):
It's a PM. It's PM. Yeah, it's a PM and then I would say, because what I'm seeing in less mature product orgs who first bring in product ops, the first thing they ask them to do is streamline the planning process. So, I would say it's a PM and maybe the agile. That's probably what it is today. I feel like program management and agile are starting to get a little bit close to each other in what they do. So, it's most of the PM stuff because we're doing elements of their job that they have off to the side versus being able to focus on. But again, in lesser mature orgs, the first thing is, "How do I actually just get the people to plan the same way and give me the thing that they're planning and doing?" 
Lenny (00:30:56):
That's interesting, what you said there, that maybe often a wedge to a product ops person joining their company maybe as a first product ops person is the planning, helping with the planning process. Is that what you find? 
Christine Itwaru (00:31:07):
It could be. The only thing that distinguishes product operations folks from program managers and agile is that product operations people know, understand the product, the customer, and the inner workings of the business. 
Lenny (00:31:20):
Cool. Yeah, Marty Cagan has some hot takes there about how product owners are never going to be great product managers. They don't really understand the customer needs and building product in any way. That's a whole other topic. I want to talk about the career path, but before we get there, I want to go in a spicy direction. So, Casey Winners, he is a guest on this podcast at one point. He wrote this hot take many years ago about this premise that operations in general often is a Band-Aid for inefficiency at a company. 
(00:31:54):
Companies often hire a bunch of ops people to just solve a problem and often they're much better ways to solve that problem. For example, tooling or a new process. His take is a person doing the thing often should be the last resort or it's a temporary gap and then over time you should strive to find a more efficient way to solve that problem than people. I don't think he's saying ops people in general or not necessary. It's an easy default. So, I'm curious what you think of that take. Generally, do you think product ops is this long term we're going to need more and more of this or is there a different path that's solving the problem that product ops? Spicy take warning.
Christine Itwaru (00:32:41):
Yes, I remember this. I'll address that inefficiency comment first, right? I mentioned a little bit earlier as roles in any industry or I guess any role matures like marketing or sales, this ops thing ends up being this natural progression. It's not just because the role itself is maturing. It's also because the org is maturing. So, what I found and what I'm finding with customers is that ops alignment across companies is what often ends up keeping the companies moving and keeping everybody aligned. So, to say ops teams are generally a sign of inefficiency or the need for them is a sign of inefficiency is not always accurate, it's generally a sign of growth and opportunity. 
(00:33:21):
People are really just trying to stay in aligned and do the best for the people that are doing the thing, the product managing, the marketing, the selling within that org. Overall though, I will say I will agree with his points about getting in and maybe giving it off and using humans for other things. I wrote something recently and I highlighted something that he mentions here in this article and what he mentioned on your podcast, which is we as product ops want to and should be standing up whatever processes or systems are needed and then get out of the way so we can focus on driving more strategic value. 
(00:33:58):
I keep mentioning that more mature product ops folks end up being a very good strategic advisor to leaders in product and to the product teams and that continues to be my belief. From day one, this has been my own personal goal for myself and for my team. I myself recently switched roles here at Pendo because I did what I said I was going to do, which was stand up the system, stand up the things that we knew we needed to do that were going to either be given off to another team or automated and then get the rest of the humans that are here to do the other strategic things for the product team.
(00:34:34):
Some of those are, "How do we increase retention? Like I mentioned, how do we focus on growth in this one area? How do we make the experience better in app? How do we do a better voice of customer management?" My energy now at Pendo is I'm able to now go towards more impactful things for not just the product team and the product community, but for our customers at large. So, I'm basically saying, "Look, I did what I needed to do and I'm ready to go." 
(00:34:56):
So I think that's something though that people need to be very, very comfortable with, very comfortable with. If you change course and change your tune two, three years into doing this and you built this team, you're like, "Here's what you're doing, manage this process," people are going to lose their mind. Change is constant, but telling someone, "I no longer need you to do that," it makes them a little bit nervous. So, for years when I was interviewing folks from my team, I made that one point abundantly clear to them, get into this role if you're comfortable letting go of things and moving on to something that is well worth your time. The company's going to change. 
(00:35:36):
Our process is going to need to be tweaked. The company is going to change. Something's going to need to be automated. We're going to need to cut something else. Maybe ChatGPT is going to make things very clear that humans are not always going to be doing the same things and we need to focus our energy elsewhere, but people do need to get comfortable with that role. 
Lenny (00:35:54):
I love that take. Generally, I think it aligns with what Casey's saying. What I'm hearing is you may be a product person today doing a bunch of stuff. Your job in a sense should be to automate as much of that as you can and find more strategic higher level things you could be doing instead of sitting there connecting Salesforce to Zendesk and maintaining that. It'd be great in customer feedback in theory. That could be a tool that could do that for you. That's part of the job. Is that roughly what you're saying? 
Christine Itwaru (00:35:54):
That's exactly what I'm saying. 
Lenny (00:36:24):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. 
(00:37:03):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing, companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:37:40):
Zooming out a little bit and building on the stuff we've been just talking about, what would you say are just signs that your company would benefit from a product ops team and that you're a fit for building a product ops team? 
Christine Itwaru (00:37:51):
I touched on this quite a bit, but that lack of transparency in many directions across, down. Sometimes people are on very transparent about, "Hey, this came up in planning and here's what we need to do." So it's relevant for stakeholder management, getting stuck out to customers, internal teams, and making sure they're aligned, revenue teams in particular. 
(00:38:11):
That was the first thing we focused on at Pendo was really aligning our success org and our sales org to the product team. We monitored success just within... I think a quarter was the time-bound space that we had it in on quality of inbound to the product team. So, that was really cool. It was just more thematic questions around tell us what you guys do because our customers would benefit from this versus teach me how to do this thing. 
Lenny (00:38:36):
I wanted to dig into the transparency piece. Is that the same point as the transparency piece or are those two different heuristics? 
Christine Itwaru (00:38:42):
That's transparency. Yeah, so what happened was we realized that we share this story actually quite openly and I'll share it here again, which is one of the things that kicked off products for us was we had a really bad launch, a really, really bad launch. It was a moment in company history where we realized that there was not transparency across the aisle and there was this lack of readiness across the organization and out to customers for what was coming. It wasn't this piece that folks say, "Oh, well, they didn't know this was coming." Well, there's two things. There's the knowing something's coming and then there's the knowing what to do with it. 
(00:39:18):
You can use just some status keeping thing to say, "This is coming in Q4 and as we get closer, here's the date," but it's what to do with it and how to position it and how to talk about it and all the things that was missing from it. It was really bad and it was my fifth week here. It was a moment of, "Well, I promised myself I'm going to let this happen." That was one of the things where I said, "I'm going to start to focus a little bit more on product ops within this director position I had just as director of product." Then I spun off and I think we need to do this thing and make it a bit more formal. 
Lenny (00:39:53):
Just to dig it on a story a little bit, so I didn't know this, so you were a product manager at Pendo. There was this bad launch and you recognize there's this gap that maybe I could fill, that somebody needs to fill and that you want to take that on. Can you talk a bit more about that? It's really interesting. 
Christine Itwaru (00:40:12):
Yeah. They brought me in as their first director level. So, I was doing a bit of director plus a little bit of IC stuff because we were starting to build up our product team. Yes, that launch happened and the product area was under development for about eight months from what I can remember. I came in with the assumption and also knowing fully well that I'm a brand new leader in this product team and product people want ownership. They crave autonomy, they crave trust, and all of that good stuff. I know that firsthand. I did not want to jump in and say, "Have you done X, Y, and Z?", especially in the first four weeks of me being there. Yeah, it did not go very well. 
(00:40:54):
So, we recognized that we had more opportunity that we should have grabbed onto to test more with customers, to find feedback loops that were going to be healthy for the team and for our customers, to stand up ways for us to measure changes and impact of changes that this thing was making to our customers. This was the biggest launch in our company history since the launch of the product. So, it was a moment where we all sat down very openly and shared with each other what we all could have done better. It wasn't just the product team. 
(00:41:25):
So, I truly believe with a really healthy product operations person or team, you have that ability to impact change across the company. So, yes, we look at that story. I remember us sitting there and being, "One day, we're going to look back at this story and we're going to say, 'Oh, yeah, I remember that.'" We do now four years later or four and a half years later, but yes, I felt really passionate about making sure that that didn't happen. 
Lenny (00:41:48):
The gaps you found are there's just like this lack of internal alignment. Sales didn't know what was going on. Customer support didn't know what was going on. That felt like that's where the gap was because that's what led to this product ops opportunity, right? 
Christine Itwaru (00:42:00):
Yes. There was a lack of alignment across again, they knew it was coming, they just didn't know the extent of what to expect and how to prepare customers or prospects or the change the way that we should have. There was definitely training. There was stuff being done. It just could have been a whole lot better. So, there were gaps there. One more point was the piece after that was I love people. I love managing people. I love healthy team environment and dynamics. 
(00:42:32):
As a product person, it means a lot to have that, because if you have direct reports, you obviously want them to be happy and healthy, but as a product person, you have this system around you even if you're not having people that report into you where you feel ownership to make sure these people are healthy. I remember even in my early days of being a PM, I wanted my engineers to be super happy. I wanted them to be proud of work that they were doing and I wanted them to be comfortable letting go of things that we no longer needed. 
(00:42:58):
I remember that moment looking around and looking at our engineers and seeing that they were like, "Hold on. What? Where do we go now? What do we do right now?" We wanted to take that moment and make it less about firefighting and more about being responsible and really customer obsessed. So, that was our moment or one of our moments for thinking about, "Okay, we might need product operations formalized here."
Lenny (00:43:24):
It's interesting that your mind went to product ops, because I think most companies would be like, "Oh, the product manager of this product screwed up. They didn't communicate enough to ensure sales. They didn't set up the marketing material well." It often falls on the product team and the product manager. What made you realize, "Oh, this is a product ops role and I need to move into that role versus here we are"? 
Christine Itwaru (00:43:46):
Yeah, I didn't say in that moment we need a product ops role. All I said in that moment was we need to create a system so that this doesn't happen again. That goes back to my definition of what product ops is. It's a thing and it is also a person or a group of people. It could be one or the other. So, I want to make sure we decouple that. It does not have to be humans. It can be that there's a system being created that is from a strong product person who knows how to get this team to be healthy. 
Lenny (00:44:12):
That's a really good way of thinking about it. That clarifies it in a big way. Thank you. You were talking about transparency and just like a sign that maybe you need product ops. I think the thing that stuck with me there is just the quality of questions the product team gets from sales, right? 
Christine Itwaru (00:44:27):
Yeah. I get a lot of questions around, "I'm investing in this. How do I measure the effectiveness of the team, all of these things?" It's really not easy to measure this in a quantitative measure just yet. Maybe one day, right? Actually, yes. Now one day, I feel like it might be coming sooner than we think. So, what we did was we looked at that transparency problem. We sent out this survey across both product managers and the sales and success teams and we said, "Where's your time going, PMs? How much time are you giving on average to the revenue team to firefight? How much time do you with customers that's quality time."
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]Then on the flip side to the revenue team, how many times do you find yourself asking questions? We gave all of these one to five and blah, blah, blah, those sorts of things, so that we can figure out where to place our energy. We came up with this, "Okay, well, it seems like there's a lack of transparency across the two groups. Let's start with getting data out or information out to the revenue team from the product org." We created this product digest. It's like today and it's matured quite a bit, but I go back to this whole people can know when they're coming, but they need to know what it is they need to do with it. So, this thing was less about this thing's coming next quarter, go tell your customers. 
(00:45:43):
It's more about here's how you get ready for it, here's how you get jazzed about, and then the handoff, which is probably the question you're going to have at some point, which is, "What's your line between PMM and products?" The handoff is that we don't teach them to sell. We don't teach them to position, but we know that the product intimately enough to help them understand the new value, to help them understand how to use the thing and to make sure that they're hitting the ground. 
Lenny (00:46:08):
Let's ask that question. If there's anything more, what is that line between product ops and product marketing? 
Christine Itwaru (00:46:13):
Yeah, I always say this and it and it's worked. I haven't seen anybody dispute it yet, but product marketing positions help the revenue team sell their lead gen for all of the outbound and the campaigns that they're running. They are marketing. They're helping you at the end of the day make this thing sound amazing and do the right things with it. For us, it's about educating and it's about helping our internal folks, our internal revenue team understand, "What is the added value? How do you now do this thing? How does this impact your role?" 
(00:46:48):
We focus a bit on the customer success persona, for example, on Pendo. Customer success managers can go in. They can see their account health and what's going on and blah, blah, blah. How does this impact you as a customer success rep and how do you then help your customers understand the value? Not hey, can you help us upsell this thing and here's how you do it. 
Lenny (00:47:06):
Great answer. Makes a lot of sense to me. Final topic, the career path of a product ops person. A lot of people listening to this podcast are either PMs today or I want to be PMs or thinking about becoming product manager, because PM can mean a lot of things. It's interesting, there's this new path that people can explore, product ops. I'm curious who you think might be a fit for the product ops role versus the product manager role. Someone deciding, "Oh, man, maybe I should go down this other route." What do you think are just signs that maybe you'd be a better fit where you enjoy that route better? 
Christine Itwaru (00:47:41):
Yeah, I love that question because it makes me feel that this role has become embraced a bit more. What I hear questions like in the past, it was, "Do we need this role and how do we help get the buy-in?" Now it's more the acceptance from a product manager to maybe want to even become this. I'm seeing more PMs, like I said, go into the space. So, it's no longer being seen so much as a threat. It's being seen as this partner. So, just one, I'll say that I think if you're someone like me who absolutely loves and I mentioned the story about the engineers and the team health and stuff, if you love creating that healthy team environment and one where there's cross-functional collaboration and it fuels you to empower the team more, it's a wonderful fit for you. 
(00:48:22):
Again, I was a PM for years and I felt that pain so much and how much we had to do in order to make this small change and then figure out whether it's valuable. I knew that there had to be a better way to get better outcomes to happen, but I also know that better outcomes don't just mean for the product. It means better outcomes for the entire product team, for the customer experience at large, and ultimately for the business. So, I think that that's one thing. If you're curious and you really want to learn more about that side of the house, one of the beautiful things I saw was one of my products managers fall more in love with understanding the business as she was starting to assure in her product ops career. I thought that was really cool. 
(00:49:04):
She had already had product background and she was like, "I want to understand the inner workings here so that I know how to help these people." So the other thing is if you're a PM having issues with the role that you're currently in, I think you need to remember that you are there to solve problems. That's a very simple thing that we talked about. What are the things that PMs won't shed and shouldn't shed and that go and talk to customers? We get to talk to customers in order to solve the problems, figure out the right problems to solve. You do that in product ops as well. You don't have to go out to customers externally, but my customers and the people I speak to are internally. They are helping me understand the pain that the product team is tied to. 
(00:49:47):
So, if you don't love solving problems through building brand new features and building a product, then how can you help contribute to solving other ones? If you're a true problem solver, think about whether you want to do that. So, if you know the pain, what can you do to build a better experience overall? You can ultimately impact your business. 
Lenny (00:50:03):
Do you find most product ops people, at least at this point, are former product managers? What would be the pie chart of last job was product manager versus not of existing product ops people? 
Christine Itwaru (00:50:13):
I got to put on a new survey. I do. I really have to put on a new survey. Initially, I saw a lot more folks moving in from management consulting, from customer success, from technical success. I haven't seen anyone from sales move in yet, and I have seen a couple PMs. Now, that's the day-to-day product ops manager. I will tell you that the people who are standing up the product ops orgs and being the first product ops hire at the leadership level are former product people. 
(00:50:45):
I strongly advocate for product ops leaders to have done that role, to have actually had hands-on product experience building and understanding customer problems and feeling that pain, because you very quickly realize where to place your efforts and where your team's efforts should go. That helps you from an efficiency perspective and the business knows you're not just dilly-dallying. 
Lenny (00:51:11):
That's really interesting. That makes a lot of sense. Just the roles you named again, where product op people come from. You said customer success. What are the others again?
Christine Itwaru (00:51:19):
I have seen technical success. I've seen management consulting. The management consulting piece makes a ton of sense to me. I think there's that data piece that they really like to lean into and advisory, and then the leadership ones coming in from product to leader roles. That's been a happy change too, seeing a director say, "I now want to move into a position to coach the teams and to help build a stronger product team overall. I don't feel like building product." 
Lenny (00:51:46):
Fascinating. For someone that's like, "Wow, I want to do this job. This sounds rad," what advice would you give for people to pursue this role and get a gig in product ops? 
Christine Itwaru (00:51:58):
Well, one, it's a good thing that there's no shortage of these roles. I would say that there are a lot of these roles open out in the industry. Be intentional about what you want to do, because right now, it's still in a bit of, "Well, what are we doing in product operations as a product management community?" There's no consistency industry to industry, size to size, team to team. It is very different. So, really think about your strengths. Do you love data? Are you a person who thrives on being able to make beauty out of this mess that you're seeing and advise people and help them understand maybe this is a direction that we should be going in? 
(00:52:40):
Are you technical where you're like, "No, I actually really enjoy doing the quantitative side of things," and you truly enjoy working with data science teams and you really like to bring that data aspect to the product teams? You could probably find a mix of both. There are people who do like doing both of those things. Generally, I mentioned this and I keep saying it, standing up that system because you know that if you had it, you would've been a better PM. 
(00:53:05):
I think that that's a big thing there. If people realize that there's a better way to do it and they no longer have to do it all but they can do a slice of it in order to drive efficiency for the organization, then start thinking about going out there and doing it. The other thing too is look at those roles and make sure that you fine-tooth comb those job descriptions. Some of them are very vague because they're trying to figure it out on their own as well. So, the more you know what you want to do as a product person, the more you know what to lead out from these roles. 
Lenny (00:53:36):
Are there red flags when you're looking at a product job description of, "Hmm, this isn't really the role you want"? 
Christine Itwaru (00:53:43):
I think this is a red flag for any role. I mentioned that it's really hard right now to put a number to the success of the role or on the success of the role, but if there's no, "This is how you will be measured or this is what we're looking at as a successful outcome for this person in this role," I would say that's probably a red flag. That's table stakes people need to have on their job descriptions. 
Lenny (00:54:06):
Final question. Something I try to get to with people from new companies that I haven't talked to before is just to get a general sense of how the product org is structured at the company. Just because people are always curious, how do you structure product teams? So I guess broadly I'd love to hear just how is the Pendo team product team structured? What are the buckets? Then also, is their product ops person integrated into each cross-functional product team? 
Christine Itwaru (00:54:31):
Yeah, I too love to learn about this. We're broken into major areas of the business or revenue streams and we have general managers over those. The GMs actually sit in the product team, which is nice. All have PM background, all really, really experienced and incredible. We also have a head of growth, so there's that component to it as well. Then you've generally got the senior directors. There are teams of product managers who are responsible for different areas in the product. So, we've got one product that's our core product and very mature, broken down into different components there. We have a newer product where that's just one straight product team versus having many different directors. 
(00:55:06):
We do have a product ops person integrated into these teams. I'd say probably all of them at this point, but the key thing here is they share themselves across two or three teams. Something going through listeners' minds right now is, "Christine, is there a ratio of product ops people to the team?" I would say that at one point, I felt like there might have been and I don't think that's the case anymore. Again, based on my experience and what I'm learning, we operate pretty lean and a lot of people are having to operate very lean right now. So, every few quarters, we look at our goals. We determine who or what goals need a product ops person and for what reason. We're really intentional about it. 
(00:55:44):
As an example, I use this saying respect the hustle with my team a little bit for the newer product that's still finding its way. The last thing you want to do as a product, which for somebody who I had a legacy product in my last job, one that I was building from the ground up and one that I was just responsible for getting out the door, sun setting at some point, you don't want anyone stifling creativity with any process or some time bound this or anything like that. So, the last thing you want to do is introduce something in there that feels like that you want them to hit the ground running. 
(00:56:18):
So, we don't over-index on things like a certain planning process or you need to get this to us because the other teams have. We need to know this thing by this timeframe. We'll do what we need to do from there. That's it. We're also quicker with the data. Voice of customer stuff takes a little bit longer for a more mature product team or this is more like, "What are we learning right now and how quickly can we communicate this over to that team so they can iterate really quickly?"
Lenny (00:56:47):
Awesome. To come back to the structure just briefly, so you have GMs, business units. Within the business units, you have directors of product that report up to the GM within each and the directors or product have cross-functional product team that they operate that builds specific features and elements of the larger product. Then there's a product ops person supporting some of these teams and they're shared across teams. Got it. 
Christine Itwaru (00:57:14):
You've got everybody rolls up to a CPO. CPO's got all of this. 
Lenny (00:57:15):
Christine, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. I'm going to just fire them away. Does that sound good? 
Christine Itwaru (00:57:23):
Yes, let's do it. 
Lenny (00:57:24):
Let's do it. Two or three books that you recommend most to other people.
Christine Itwaru (00:57:28):
Classic is Inspired by Marty Cagan. It's one of the reasons I really fell in love with the product. It's inspirational. Leaders Eat Last, Simon Sinek. I really like that book too. That's more leadership style and making sure you putting in your team first, which is something I strongly believe in. This is a plug, but I also really like the book and it's very practical so it falls in that category, which is the Product-Led Organization by our CEO Todd Olsen. Really good book for right now, especially with people really going through this transformation. 
(00:58:00):
There's an old book that I have that's sitting on that shelf. It's Product Roadmaps Relaunched. It is really old. I mean I don't want to date myself, but it's almost 20 years old when I was in college. But it's really, really valuable and I can reference it just for a quick yeah, I forgot about that from a communication perspective for a roadmap. This is really cool. 
Lenny (00:58:21):
Favorite other podcast?
Christine Itwaru (00:58:22):
The Product Experience Podcast from Mind the Product. I really like that one. A little bit similar to this other favorite one I'm on right now, but lots of really good product people and just very practical advice too. For leadership, I like HBR IdeaCast. Again, I like to balance the business side and the people side of leaderships.
Lenny (00:58:44):
Favorite recent movie or TV show?
Christine Itwaru (00:58:46):
Because I have kids, my brain is flooded generally with kid shows. I would say this year, it was between the new Matilda movie, which is based on the Broadway production, which was based on the old Matilda movie, but it's really, really good. Really well done. Then there's this movie. I think it's called Rise. Have you seen it? It's about the Giannis... I cannot say, forgive me, his last name, but he's on the Milwaukee Bucks, basketball player. It's about overcoming adversity and just struggle and really pushing through and giving it your all. I think that one is really good. Add it to your list if you haven't. It's called RISE. TV, I have Food. I don't have a favorite TV show. I've just finished watching White Lotus if that's qualified. 
Lenny (00:59:33):
It's the most popular mentioned TV show on this podcast. 
Christine Itwaru (00:59:40):
Yeah, I would say for TV in general, you give me anything food. I love cooking. I'll cook an entire massive meal, three course, whatever, sit down, and eat it while I'm watching. Yeah. 
Lenny (00:59:53):
Yum. Favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people? 
Christine Itwaru (00:59:58):
If you could choose any career outside of what you're doing, what would it be and why? 
Lenny (01:00:04):
What do you look for in an answer there that tells you that this is a strong candidate versus not? 
Christine Itwaru (01:00:08):
There are skills that are a part of that other role that I would lean into. So, if somebody were to ask me that question, I would tell you a chef. It's about experience and it's about constantly refining your craft and it's about constantly looking to delight. I think that speaks to my love for product. It's all about that end state for the customer. So, I always ask that question and I look to see, "What is it? Are they looking for fame? Are they looking for the temporary role?" It's really telling. You dig into the qualities of what makes a good candidate for the other thing. You can figure out a lot. 
Lenny (01:00:47):
Fascinating. If they're watching this and learning the secret, that's a good sign too. They're doing the research. 
Christine Itwaru (01:00:52):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:00:53):
Top five SaaS products that you love, use at work other than Pendo. 
Christine Itwaru (01:00:53):
I got to say Pendo.
Lenny (01:00:59):
We already know. We already know that's on the list. 
Christine Itwaru (01:01:01):
Yeah, I love Miro. I love Miro so much. During the pandemic, this became an essential tool for so many teams. I brought it into our company and I was a big advocate, part of my last one as well, just the collaboration and connection. Figma along the same lines, I think Figma is really great at that for our design team and the rest of products. So, that one's been really good. Seismic is one that I really like as well. That's the content management system for our go-to-market teams. So, it really plays well into how do we make sure we give them what they need and the tool that they need to be in. 
(01:01:36):
Gong is another one. I think Gong's really great. I've watched them go from the early days and I think we were an early customer or we were using it early on. I think they've pivoted at some point or they've definitely updated messaging on the coaching for their teams and us being able to dig into the qualitative insights that we get on those calls of people is really good too. So, yeah.
Lenny (01:02:01):
Great list. Ones that people haven't mentioned before, so that's always fun. Final question, what's something relatively minor that you've changed in Pendo's product development process that has had a tremendous impact on the way that you build product? 
Christine Itwaru (01:02:15):
This one's going to sound really elementary or for some people really elementary, but for some people, they're going to be like, "Uh-huh, I totally feel that." Early on, we started bringing in engineers to customer meetings more and more and you don't want to typecast or profile an engineer, but generally, they're not raising their hand and being like, "Yeah, I'm going to come and join, blah, blah, blah." They want to make sure they're doing their job and building the experience, but it's so simple and it's so effective. When we started doing it, the response from the engineering team was great and then also it helped us dig into a different side of the customer while we were on call sometimes. Some of them were flies on the walls. 
(01:02:52):
Some of them were actually engaging with the engineers and help them increase their confidence in speaking to customers. So, I don't know. I feel like that just ended up changing a lot of the way that we started planning and making sure that their voice had a certain amount of weight or even more weight than it did before in the product development lifecycle. We respect their time. I remember some were very nervous and be like, "Oh, I got to do all this other stuff," but they're like, "Okay, I'll try it." 
(01:03:21):
Then all of a sudden, they're like, "Whoa, I really want to do this more and more." But it's just really being able to see that pain for them firsthand from a customer or the delight and frustration was very impactful. So, that's my answer and I feel like if you're not doing that as a product manager or product leader, then you better get on that train real fast because it's life changing for the entire team. 
Lenny (01:03:42):
That is an awesome answer. This is the first time I've asked this question. I think I'm going to make it a standard question now because I feel like we're going to get all kinds of cool nuggets. So, thank you for starting it off with a bang. Christine, thank you so much for joining me. I learned more about product ops in an hour than I've learned in years and years of reading about it online. 
Christine Itwaru (01:04:02):
Thank you. 
Lenny (01:04:02):
So, thanks for making the time. Thanks for sharing all your wisdom. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe ask you some questions about product ops and then how can listeners be useful to you? 
Christine Itwaru (01:04:13):
They can connect with me on LinkedIn. You'll put that up, I'm sure. Twitter, same. I've got my own site, so the productcraft.com. I started posting on product management products. I'm going to start doing some stuff on careers, all that good stuff. How can they be useful? So don't laugh at me, people. I needed a Twitter reset and so I had that for 13 years and then I no longer did and now I took it. So, just help me rebuild over there and just get back on that site. That's more immediate, but I would say help me understand what's going on in product and product ops. I will continue to do things like this and share more about what I'm learning, but I need to learn more from other people as well. That's an amazing, incredible part of my job that I'm about to do. 
(01:05:00):
There's just like a lot of pain right now all around us in the tech industry. I think about today and probably the next year or so. For people who are really questioning their next steps in their product careers, whether they stay in it, whether they move into something adjacent or relevant, they're looking to sharpen their skills, maybe make a site pivot to ops, whatever it is. I'm really interested to just gather more data on this and see how it all plays out while also trying to see if I can make some connections. So, I've been able to do that. Full circle back to Ben, Ben did this for me and you. I think that it's really important that the product community is smaller than we think. It's large and it feels expansive, but it's smaller than we think. 
(01:05:43):
I think we're all facing an interesting time where people may be, again, questioning that next move or struggling. It would just be amazing for us to share. So, cheesy as it may sound, product ops for me was an easy way to be able to connect the dot and be that partner, right? Talk about the transparency and alignment. If there's a way that this community can help empower me to do more of that for all of you, I think that that would be incredibly helpful. 
Lenny (01:06:06):
What a beautiful way to end it. Christine, thank you again for being here. 
Christine Itwaru (01:06:10):
Thank you. This was so fun.

## Transcript

Christopher Lochhead (00:00:00):
The point being, now is the greatest time in history to be a creator, to be an entrepreneur, to be a marketer. I've been a marketer for my entire adult life. It's never been greater than it is right now. And so here's the big thing that I would share. If you are somebody for whom you want to make an exponential difference, you want to innovate, you want to create new value where there wasn't, you want to have a legendary career where you could look back on your career and go, you know what? I was part of this and that, and I was on this team, now's the greatest time in history. And what I would say to you is, the future needs you.

Lenny (00:00:35):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

(00:00:43):
Today my guest is Christopher Lochhead. Christopher is a 13-time number one bestselling co-author, including books like Play Bigger and Niche Down. He's also a popular podcaster, co-creator of the excellent Substack Category Pirates, and is best known as the Godfather of Category Design. He's also an advisor to over 50 venture-backed startups, and a former three-time public company CMO.

(00:01:07):
In our conversation, we dig deep into all things category design, including what exactly is category design? Why, in order to build a legendary business, it's so essential to build your own category versus trying to become the best in an existing category. Also, how to actually go about creating your own category. A ton of examples of companies that did this well and didn't do this well, what we could learn from them. Plus a ton of practical frameworks, including something Chris calls The "Better" Trap. Also, why he thinks product market fit is a very dangerous idea. Chris is such a character and I had such a blast speaking with Chris. With that, I bring you Christopher Lochhead after a short word from our sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:37):
Christopher, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Christopher Lochhead (00:03:41):
Lenny, it is my absolute joy. And let me say in case my ADHD brain forgets, I love all things Lenny. You're doing a great job, buddy. I'm honored to be here. And there's so many people in the entrepreneur startup marketing world who are scam artists, shysters, pieces of shit, idiotic hustle porn stars yelling stupidities. There's a lot of idiocy in the world in which you travel and I travel, and you, sir, stand out. You are making a difference. The conversations you're driving, the content you're creating. You're fucking awesome, Lenny, and I'm really stoked to be here with you.

Lenny (00:04:27):
Damn, what an intro to my own podcast. I'm bad at accepting compliments. I'm just going to accept that and I appreciate that, man.

Christopher Lochhead (00:04:34):
No, you need to get it. You are a beacon in an ocean of crapola. You are incredible.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Well, enough about me. I really appreciate it. I was preparing for our conversation and usually what I try to do when I prepare for conversations is I read everything the person has written and it was very challenging with you. You have two podcasts, you have at least six books. There's probably more I missed. You have a newsletter, you tweet a lot. There's probably a lot of other stuff I didn't get to. And so you made my job very difficult preparing for this podcast, but also very worthwhile. So I'm excited to begin.

Christopher Lochhead (00:05:07):
I apologize for that.

Lenny (00:05:09):
The other thing I noticed as I was browsing your website, and it was hilarious because you have all these testimonials of your book and podcast and you have a lot of negative reviews, like "Off-putting, or, "Very disappointing," or, "Absolute crap." I'm curious why you chose to do that as your website testimonial wall.

Christopher Lochhead (00:05:29):
Well, and I believe, I'd have to check with Steve Osler, the founder and publisher of Podcast Magazine, but I believe I'm the only podcaster in history to run a full page ad in Podcast Magazine with just negative quotes in it.

(00:05:44):
So a couple reasons. Number one, can we all just have a sense of humor about this stuff? So it's my way, and the name of our team, yet we're sort of a company, but we're more of a band, is Category Pirates. I mean, clearly if you're called Category Pirates, you're probably trying to have a little bit of fun with this stuff. And so part of it is just trying to have a sense of humor with people.

(00:06:10):
The second piece of it is, for a lot of entrepreneurs, marketers, creators, innovators of any kind, we live in this fear that when we launch our thing, whatever our thing is, that we will be criticized by the world and that we will be made fun of. And if you've ever authored a book or done a podcast or done anything, built a product, a software product, built any kind of a product that you feel is part of you, and most innovators, creators, software developers, artists, of course entrepreneurs, feel that way because they put themselves into this stuff. And when somebody criticizes us, many of us are devastated. And I have been in the past too. I'm a person just like anybody else.

(00:06:55):
And what I realized is, fuck them. Anybody who's trying to do anything exponential, anybody who's trying to break and take new ground, anybody who's trying to radically innovate, anybody who's trying to design and dominate new categories of the way we live, work and play, gets criticized. Picasso was called stupid. The Beatles were called terrible. Elvis was called terrible. I just wrote recently a little bit about hip-hop. I was listening to Rick Rubin on Barry Weiss's podcast, excellent episode. Excellent. She does a great job with him. And he was talking about how ridiculed hip-hop was in the beginning and it got banned. And it's the number one category of music in America today.

(00:07:38):
Anyway, so that's also part of it, is to just sort of say, "Hey, look, this is some of the shit people have said about our work and my work, and I'm going to just put it on display, because this is going to happen to all of us."

(00:07:50):
And then I guess, Lenny, the third reason is in the creator world, broadly, there's a lot of people who are breaking their arms patting themselves on the back. And look, I understand why we have to tell people about why they should pay attention to us, and so we use our credentials or our awards or our downloads or our books, I understand that, and I do a little bit of that too. However, come on, let's just not take ourselves so seriously.

Lenny (00:08:17):
Amazing. I could definitely use more of that skill of not taking negative feedback as seriously. And I love the idea of just embracing it and showing people what people don't like.

Christopher Lochhead (00:08:27):
Why not? I mean, look, you're incredibly successful and if somebody says something negative about you, okay, great. Fuck them. They're not your people.

Lenny (00:08:39):
Fuck them. There we go.

Christopher Lochhead (00:08:40):
I didn't know who you were until Substack, and I saw your logo, the fiery logo, and there was something endearing about your logo. And the other thing that's great about you, from a radical differentiation marketing perspective is, you call yourself Lenny. And when I talk about you, I don't know your fucking last name. I mean, I sort of know it, but I don't really, you know what I mean?

Lenny (00:09:04):
Yeah. It's hard to pronounce.

Christopher Lochhead (00:09:04):
Actually, I was at the gym this morning and I was telling my buddy that we were doing this, and I said, "Oh, I'm going on Lenny's Podcast." He says, "Lenny who?" And I said, "It begins with an R. I don't know. Everybody just calls him Lenny." And so the fact that you are yourself, you don't play a character, you're not a douche, you're just a person trying to be successful in the world and help others, right?

(00:09:28):
That's a very powerful thing. And I think one of the things that is insidious about influencers, hustle porn stars, part of the business model is creating the perception of superiority, right? The reason Grant Cardone and Tai Lopez and all these douchebags pose in front of planes and all this garbage is they want you, the Kardashians are the queens of this, they want you to look at them and go, "Oh, wow, don't I wish that I was them."

(00:10:03):
And so these folks are in the create and monetize envy business, and you're the opposite of that. And I think the legendary educators in the native digital world are the opposite of that. Anybody who's creating separation, anybody who's putting themselves above, anybody for whom there must be, "I must be the leader, and you must be the follower," that's the business model of a massive amount of people in the native digital world, and we reject that. And I know you do.

Lenny (00:10:34):
Absolutely. We've already gotten way off track, but I love it. I'll just say one thing and then we'll get back on track. The reason I called my newsletter, Lenny's Newsletter is because that was the default recommendation Substack gave me when I signed up. They're just like, "Call it this." And I'm like, "Okay," because I don't know, I didn't have no plans to actually be doing this long term. And then it just stuck. And then I brainstormed for weeks. I'm like, "I need a real name on this thing." And I just couldn't think of anything that I liked. So I'm just like, "All right, I'll just roll with it." And then when the podcast launched, I tried so many ways to call it something else so that it would push the whole naming in a different direction, it wasn't about me, but I couldn't think of anything better. So I'm just rolling with it at this point.

Christopher Lochhead (00:11:12):
Well, and the interesting thing is, even though the branding of the shit has your name in, it's not about you. That's the irony, right? Meghan Markle gets canceled. Why? Because it's about her, and it turns out she's infinitely uninteresting. I've consumed enough of your content to know that the cool thing is, yeah, it's called Lenny, but it's actually, you are not trying to impress all of us with how awesome you are in front of a fucking plane or a bunch of scantily clad people, or I don't know what.

Lenny (00:11:54):
It's true. Well, I'm enjoying this podcast. You're very kind to me. Let's talk about the meat of what I want to chat about, which is your bread and butter category creation. It goes without saying you're a big fan of creating your own category versus what most people try to do, which is try to compete in an existing category. So just to kind of lay a little foundation, can you just explain what this actually means, this idea of category creation for people that have heard this idea in this term, but don't really know what it means.

Christopher Lochhead (00:12:23):
It turns out that in business, most people, and in life for that matter, make a unquestioned, unconsidered, undialogued, unthought of decision that they don't know they made. And the decision they make is, "What I'm going to do, is I am going to compete in a market with demand, with a better product/service/brand, maybe a better business model, maybe a better set of growth hacking ideas that I learned on the Lenny Podcast. And when the world gets my better, the world will beat a path to my door."

(00:13:16):
And if you go onto Amazon right now, Lenny, there's roughly a hundred thousand marketing books, and I think I'd have to double check, but I think there's about 60,000 or 80,000 business strategy books. And of course, me and my collaborators, we haven't read all of them, but like you and like many of us in business, we've read many of the tomes, the Bibles out there, and there's an interesting thing about virtually all of them. That's what they're about. It's about how to compete and win.

(00:13:53):
Well, here's the aha. Nobody legendary ever did that. Not a one. We all know who Bob Marley is. We don't know who the 17th greatest reggae musician or band in the world is. We all know who Pablo Picasso is. We don't know who the fifth greatest cubist artist is. And so wherever you look in life, whether it's in the business world, people who drive social change, artists, creators of any kind, the people that we tend to admire the most are the people who broke and took new ground. And the aha here is the category makes the product, the category makes the brand, the category makes the company.

(00:14:51):
So I'll give you the data and then I'll fully answer your question. So here's the data. We did an analysis for our first book where we studied every venture-backed tech company in the US from 2000 to 2015. And we asked a question that, to the best of our knowledge, had never been asked before. And we went to Stanford and we asked a bunch of professors this question, and they said, "We don't know this. You're going to have to do it yourselves." So we did, and incidentally had it peer reviewed and published in the HBR. And if you've ever gotten data published in the HBR, then you know what it's like to have a journalistic proctology exam.

(00:15:32):
Anyway, here's the net of it. In tech market categories, on average, one company earns two-thirds, 76% to be exact, of the total value created as measured by market cap and or valuation. So not market share, which is important, market cap as measured by the value of all the companies in the category. So you take a category, you add all the companys' value together, and you say, "What percent goes to the leader, the category, queen or king? And what percent goes to everybody else?" One company, two-thirds of the economics.

(00:16:12):
So the aha here, Lenny, is when we make the unquestioned, unconsidered, undialogued decision that we didn't know that we made, to compete, we have unwittingly said, "We're going to fight for the 24%." And it's the distinction or delta between create demand and capture demand. So we prefer the term category design, and I can explain why design instead of creation, we don't have anything against creation, but creation creates a confusion in people's mind. When people hear category creation, because most people in business, most people in tech, are strongly oriented to product, what they think you said is first to ship a product that has X features.

(00:17:08):
So when most people say category creation, that's what they think. They say, "They [inaudible 00:17:16] category, Myspace did." Or if you've been around for a little while longer, "GeoCities did." And so category creation, category design, does not equal first to ship a product with a set of features. So what does it equal? Here's the aha. Just like you can design a product, just like you can design a company culture or business model, you can actually design a market.

(00:17:46):
And in so doing, you create a new distinction in value for people that didn't exist before. I'll give you a simple example. If I could own any product in the world right now, I think I'd probably want to own Purell. And there's a great thing about the company that makes Purell. The company's been around for a very, very long time, and they're owned by the original family that created the company. Their original problem that they were solving is, it was a husband and wife team, and they were working in a factory. This was 80 plus years ago. The company, by the way, is called Gojo Industries. Gojo. And Gojo is a portmanteau, putting their two names together. I think it was, maybe it was Gloria and Joseph, or I'd have to double check the husband and wife names, you'll excuse me, but the company's called Gojo Industries, and I think the granddaughter runs it today, if I'm not mistaken.

(00:18:54):
Anyway, so the gal, the wife said, "This bar soap is disgusting. It's full of crapola, it's hairy, it's full of man nastiness." So the solution to washing your hands called a bar of soap was a disgusting, inappropriate solution for her. So she reimagined the problem, not as, "How do I wash my hands," but as, "How do I wash my hands without a disgusting bar soap?" And Gojo Industries created a whole new category called liquid soap. And in most restaurants, most corporate bathrooms, most airport bathrooms, if you start paying attention, you'll see the Gojo logo on the squeezy thing that you pull when you go to get the soap. So unlike most innovators and entrepreneurs, who get obsessed with the solution, and I understand why, we all love our shit, we all love our product. If you want to talk to me about our shit, I want to talk all about it.

(00:20:05):
We could do a 12-hour deep dive on all your content and how you built the newsletter, and you'd love it. It'd be great. We all do. If you're a creator of any kind, entrepreneur, innovator of any kind, you love the thing you're creating, of course. However, Gojo focused on the problem, not just the solution. So they stay obsessed with the problem, and then they ask a different question, which is, "How do I wash my hands in the absence of water?" And of course, the answer to that question is a new category, [inaudible 00:20:44] hand sanitizer. And the dominant brand, of course is Purell.

(00:20:49):
And so the aha here is the company that designs the space and gets it to tip at scale. And when I say designs the space, what I mean is specifically gets a meaningful percentage of the world to agree with their definition of a problem set, which then leads to their definition of a solution set. The company that does that at any kind of scale, wins. And so the number one question for any entrepreneur or any creator at all is, "Do I want to compete for 24% of an existing market category? Or do I want to create my own where if I can execute, I will earn two-thirds of the economics?" That's the decision that most entrepreneurs make, that they don't know that they made. And at its heart, category design is about the most radical kind of differentiation.

(00:21:52):
So most companies actively seek comparison. If you go to, well, if go to many software company's website right now on their homepage, you'll see a Gartner report or a Forrester report on their homepage. You'll see ads and/or content that say, "Here are three competitors and a list of features," and there'll be 25 features, "And then there's us," and there'll be 125 features. And they're actively inviting comparison. You even hear it in ads. If you listen to what marketers say, Lenny, we say the stupidest shit. Don't take our word for it. Anyway. And so the legendary innovators over time, they did not compare their innovation to the past. They broke and took new ground. They wanted to be irreplaceable. They wanted to be so much value in the minds of customers that not only were the switching costs horrible, switch to what?

Lenny (00:23:07):
To follow this thread a little bit, companies that you're pretty familiar with, maybe just a rapid fire sharing of their category to give people a concrete sense of what does it even mean to have a category?

Christopher Lochhead (00:23:21):
Okay, let's go.

Lenny (00:23:22):
It's becoming obvious that they basically all came up with a different category that they wanted to win. And so Gong comes up as an example. I don't know if you know about Gong. I think they-

Christopher Lochhead (00:23:32):
I do.

Lenny (00:23:33):
So it's basically like sales analytics is what they pitch, is like, this is the first thing you can ever do to understand how your sales team is doing. Is there anything you know more about their approach?

Christopher Lochhead (00:23:43):
Yeah, I know the space very, very well, and they did something incredibly smart. So they were a little later in the space than some others. And so there were a whole bunch of companies in today which you could broadly refer to as the revenue space, right? In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm familiar with Clary. I'm good friends with Andy. I know the team. I've done some work with them. So all disclosure. Clary, and a handful of others, in the beginning started to create the space that ultimately became RevOps. And the interesting thing that Gong did, very smart, was as RevOps started to emerge, they were smart enough to realize that revenue was going to be a big new important space. That CRM didn't actually do it. That ERP didn't actually do it. BI didn't actually do it. And so there was this sort of emerging set of thinking around, "We need a different approach to revenue."

(00:24:44):
They were smart enough to realize that if they went for the whole enchilada, it's not credible from a startup that you're going to go build, that you're going to show up and say, "We have a suite that's equivalent to that of SAP, just for this other area." So they picked off a very tight part of a broader emerging category, and they executed incredibly, and they dominated that part. But here's the mistake they made. In all new mega categories, they start like this. This is exactly what happened in CRM. I could walk you through the history if it matters, but there were companies in support, there were companies in help desk, there were companies in sales, there were companies in marketing, and there were a whole bunch of sub-niches underneath that. There was a point in time in the Salesforce automation category, when that was a standalone category, that some of the hottest companies in that category were sales configurator companies, a further down niche.

(00:25:44):
And so as these mega spaces emerge over time, no one company can fulfill the needs of a customer. And so there's all these niches. The mistake that Gong made, as well as the vast majority of others in that space, is they stayed in their micro niche. So the strategy in the beginning that was genius and exactly what you should do as a startup, all of a sudden, when they didn't expand and set the agenda, the design for the big category, they got fucked. Because now they're niched. And there's a big learning in this Lenny, which is, if you're a company that's already up and running and you're winning, and let's say you're becoming the category queen in your space, every entrepreneur, every CEO, faces a fascinating moment. If they become successful in the first five years or so, which is they realize their biggest barrier to growth going forward, is their current category, because you can only be as big and successful as your market category.

(00:27:02):
And so you have to continuously expand the vision for the category and continuously build on that. And if you don't, and somebody else frames, claims, and names, the bigger agenda, as has been the case, and look, I'm biased, as has been the case with Clary, Clary's crushing everybody in this space right now, and the Gongs and all the other players are now in this horrible position, which is they basically only have two choices. One, they can stay in their niche, which is what most players do, and they argue best of breed "Oh, well, we're the best revenue carbodingulator. And you could go buy an end-to-end revenue platform. But if you do that, you won't get the best functionality in the carbodingulator space. So buy our revenue carbodingulator." That doesn't work. Microsoft proved it over 30 years ago, and we can talk about that if you want.

Christopher Lochhead (00:28:00):
Microsoft proved it over 30 years ago, and we can talk about that if you want. You either stay in your niche and get diminished over time, or you uplevel and you go to play for the whole enchilada. The problem is for them and all the others in this space who didn't do that, if they were to do it today, well over a year after Clari did, they're just a Clari copycat. And so basically you either go compete with Clari for who can be the category king, or you stay in your niche and get diminished over time. And if you're going to go compete with the company that is laying down the category design that's picking up the most momentum for the overall market, you better know how to do a fifth dan black belt category wars.

Lenny (00:28:58):
Following that thread, there's a bunch of threads I'd love to follow, but something I definitely wanted to touch on is, in this concept of the better trap, which is where most people go, where they try to be the better solution in an existing category. And just to reinforce that point, what have you seen? What have you learned about just why that is often, and maybe always the wrong approach?

Christopher Lochhead (00:29:19):
Let's take a very current example, Threads. We just wrote about this. When Threads came out, and I can show you all the headlines if you want to see them, New York Times, nevermind tech... All these places. Twitter killer, Twitter killer, Twitter killer, Twitter killer. And at the time there's all this discussion of Musk and Zuck having a UFC cage fight. And so there's all this buildup into the launch of Threads and there's all this supposed Twitter hate, and, quote, unquote, "Everybody's leaving Twitter." All right. So Threads comes out. What happens? Threads surpasses GPT as the fastest growing app ever.

(00:30:08):
Now the headlines, Lenny, are coming. This is it. Zuck's a genius. It's incredible. And by the way, this sits inside one of the newer stupid axioms in Silicon Valley. So this is a side note, but when somebody says something in Silicon Valley that enough people think, "Yes, that's smart." They just parrot it. They don't actually think about it. There's a current thinking in Silicon Valley, and this was real loud as Threads was coming out, this was the reason why Threads was the Twitter killer. What you need, Lenny, is brand and distribution. That's what you need, especially distribution. I would assert to you that Threads had the greatest distribution advantage of any new piece of software ever launched. If there's another one that has a greater distribution advantage, I'd like to know what it is.

Lenny (00:31:11):
No, that seems right. Seems right.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:14):
Massive distribution, incredible, easy up and on, incredible. Free product, not even freemium, free. Awesome. And Facebook Meta, you tell me, one of the 10 most powerful brands in tech?

Lenny (00:31:32):
Absolutely.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:33):
How many users does Facebook have today, Lenny, do you know?

Lenny (00:31:35):
Over a billion? Might be more.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:37):
How many billion person apps have there been in the history of apps?

Lenny (00:31:42):
None.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:43):
Right.

Lenny (00:31:43):
I think.

Christopher Lochhead (00:31:44):
Legendary brand, the greatest distribution advantage in history. What happened? It cratered. It's gone. It's still there, but nobody's there.

Lenny (00:31:59):
They're launching the [inaudible 00:32:00] soon so they have another shot.

Christopher Lochhead (00:32:02):
Oh yeah. Now why, why did that happen? Why did one of the richest people in the history of the world, who's potentially one of the smartest people in the history of entrepreneurship in tech, fail so miserably when the entire world said he was going to "kill," quote, unquote, Twitter? And after the initial, quote, "success" of Threads everybody said that's exactly what was going to happen. And now all those experts are surprisingly quiet. The legendary Kevin Maney said that category design is a new lens on business. It's a different lens. It's sits next to the product lens, it sits next to the competition lens, but it is equally important. So here's what happened with Threads.

(00:32:54):
They attacked an existing, well-known, well understood, incredibly well-defined problem with a direct copy. They even were celebrating that it was Twitter, just better. They said virtually those words. So known existing problem with a known existing solution that was, quote, unquote, "better" and integrated with the rest of the Meta shit. Quote, "Everybody checked it out and everybody went away." Why? Here's the aha.

(00:33:33):
Problems create categories, and you either have to A, solve a new problem, or B, reframe, name and claim an existing problem in a, I'm going to use these words on purpose, very different way. And if you reframe the existing problem such that people see it in a different way, that's when they'll be open to a new solution. But the mistake is the impasses is on the wrong [inaudible 00:34:11]. The impasses is on the product. Because we live in a world where just like the availability of oxygen, we believe the best product wins. Zuckerberg is going to blow in excess of a billion dollars on Threads and it will fail. It already has failed. Because you can't take an existing problem with an existing solution, launch exactly the same shit, tell the world it's better and have the world embrace it. Because the problem makes the solution the other way around.

Lenny (00:34:51):
So classic advice along these lines is, if you're, say, 10 times better than the existing product, you have a good chance at getting people to care and having success. Is there a line of just like it's the same thing but 10 times better? Or do you have to, in your experience, reframe? And I want to talk about that.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:07):
Let's just look at the evidence. We could agree that Jeff Bezos is not a dumb person, yes?

Lenny (00:35:14):
Yes.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:16):
Do you have an Amazon Fire phone?

Lenny (00:35:19):
I don't.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:20):
Neither do I. Why not?

Lenny (00:35:24):
I'm very happy with my iPhone.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:27):
And so, Bezos launched a better product and nobody bought it. And the reason nobody bought it is the problem. And therefore the solution that you think you're solving with your iPhone is solved with your iPhone. When was the last time you enjoyed a Red Bull Cola?

Lenny (00:35:48):
Not once.

Christopher Lochhead (00:35:50):
Red Bull made exactly the same mistake that Zuck just made with threads. What Red Bull believed was, "We built one of the greatest brands in the world." Which they have, but they didn't understand why. The category made the brand not the other way around. Energy Drink made the category, so they go, "Great, we can put our brand on anything and it'll sell. So let's make Cola." They lost a bazillion dollars. It's reported that Microsoft lost somewhere between 400 and a billion dollars in Microsoft Stores. Did you ever go to a Microsoft store, Lenny?

Lenny (00:36:28):
I walked by them in the mall and I don't think I've ever entered.

Christopher Lochhead (00:36:32):
Well, they look exactly... If you remember, they look exactly like an Apple Store. And Ballmer famously told the team, when the Apple Stores took off, he famously told the team, "Go to the Apple Stores, study everything they're doing and let's copy it exactly." Google that shit, it's out there. Well, it didn't work. Why? Because you can't attack an incumbent category queen unless you frame, name and claim a new or different problem. Because when the existing problem is well understood and the existing solution is well understood, there's no need for a new solution. Even if people, quote, unquote, "hate Twitter," didn't do anything to Twitter, and now Zuck's going to have to write off probably over a billion dollars on Threads. And the funny thing is, Lenny, this just keeps happening over and over and over. Venture capitalists in the next five years will blow at least half a trillion dollars in the AI space alone, on me too, demand chasing existing category competing startups that have a 10x better product, no one cares.

(00:38:02):
And look, we're all going to sit here and watch them do it. And we, category pirates, and those of us in the category design world will say, "Told you." And they're just going to keep doing it. More importantly, because the big companies in many cases can afford to continue to fail and make this mistake. The tragedy in this is how many legendary innovative products never got to see the light of day because the inventor, the creator, the entrepreneur, believed in the product, but didn't know that every solution has to fit into a problem of value for people. And so their innovation went nowhere.

Lenny (00:38:51):
Let's talk about how to actually go about designing a category. You've used this phrase a few times, and that may be the best lens to approach it. If not, we can go at it from a different direction. But this idea of framing, naming, and claiming, how do you do that? What's that process like?

Christopher Lochhead (00:39:08):
Great question. It starts somewhere where most people don't want to start, and that is, the first law of category design is thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking. Thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking. If you're going to think about thinking, we have to define thinking. Now, the minute I start down this path, there's a meaningful percentage of people whose eyes rolling, going, "Here comes some bullshit," right? "Just tell me how to do the SEO, Lenny. Where's the SEO? Or where's the..." Whatever the tactical thing is.

(00:39:47):
So the first thing we have to do is break down thinking. Roger Martin is considered to be the greatest management thinker, or certainly one of them alive today. We were lucky enough to have him on the podcast when his most recent book came out, which if I'm remembering correctly, is called the New Way to think. People call him the new Peter Drucker. And he describes it as effectively as anyone I've ever heard. And at a high level, and this is me paraphrasing, so give me some license, but he's the source. At a high level there's two kinds of thinking, reflective and reflexive. And now, this is my editorializing. What most people think is reflective thinking is actually reflexive thinking. What's reflex versus reflective? Reflex is simple. You go for an annual checkup, yes?

Lenny (00:40:41):
I should be.

Christopher Lochhead (00:40:43):
Have you ever had a doctor whack your knee with the little pink?

Lenny (00:40:46):
Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (00:40:46):
And your knee goes whoop.

Lenny (00:40:49):
I do [inaudible 00:40:49] .

Christopher Lochhead (00:40:50):
And she's testing your reflexes. And that's an involuntary thing, when you're sitting on the doctor's table and your legs are hanging like a little kid and she goes whack, your leg just does this twitch, right? So that's a reflex. And reflexive thinking is very, very powerful. You have a driver's license, I'm guessing.

Lenny (00:41:11):
I do.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:12):
And when was the last time you were in a vehicle, driving?

Lenny (00:41:15):
Yesterday.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:17):
And if you're out on the road driving and somebody cuts you off, what are you likely to do?

Lenny (00:41:25):
I get a little upset and then I keep driving.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:29):
But I would assert, Lenny, you do something before you get upset.

Lenny (00:41:31):
I guess I try to avoid hitting this car.

Christopher Lochhead (00:41:34):
Yes. And maybe you swerve, maybe you hit the brakes, maybe you do both. My point is this, the car cuts you off and we instantly, no thinking, react in order to save our lives, not damage our vehicles, not hurt anybody else. We didn't think about that. We literally just reacted. That's the way people think about most things. I say to you, Lenny, let's talk about guns and abortion and immigration rights in America.

Lenny (00:42:14):
No, thanks.

Christopher Lochhead (00:42:15):
Now you have opinions about those things, right?

Lenny (00:42:17):
I do.

Christopher Lochhead (00:42:18):
As do I. Most people don't challenge their own thinking. Most people say, "Now, why do I only think what I think about abortion? Where did I learn that? What do I really think about abortion? What do others think about abortion? Are there smart people in the world that I admire who are more educated and experienced in this field that have meaningfully different opinions than my own? There are. Why is that?" Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. We don't fucking do that, we say our opinion on abortion is the opinion on abortion. And in the United States of America in the political domain we say, "And anybody who thinks differently is trying to kill America." That's not thinking. So reflexive thinking is, what do I really think? Why do I think that? And in the business world, most people unconsciously assume the future is a continuation of the past. That's not what legendary entrepreneurs do. Legendary entrepreneurs don't just think they know the future is going to be different, because they're designing that different future. And the problem they're focused on matters to them so much that the fact that the problem continues to persist makes them batshit crazy. RJ... Is it RJ or JR? I can't remember now... The founder of Rivian, obviously Musk at Tesla, these guys are obsessed. It drives them insane. They don't understand why we're not all in EVs already.

(00:44:12):
And so my friend Mike Maples, the legendary venture capitalist from Floodgate, says, "The greatest entrepreneurs are visitors from the future telling us how it's going to be." And the reason many of them are so irascible is because the fact that the present is not already at the future that they see makes them insane. And so the point being legendary entrepreneurs and creators make the future different. They literally are in the design different futures business. Can I tell you a story?

Lenny (00:44:46):
Please.

Christopher Lochhead (00:44:50):
We're friends, and we've done some work with the guys who created Lomi. And Lomi is the first kitchen appliance in 20 years to earn a spot on the kitchen counter. A, it's one of the fastest growing new consumer items in the last 20 years. And B, if you think about your kitchen counter, do you have a toaster?

Lenny (00:45:19):
Yep.

Christopher Lochhead (00:45:21):
Coffee maker?

Lenny (00:45:22):
Yeah, I don't drink too much coffee, but we do have one.

Christopher Lochhead (00:45:25):
Any other devices on the kitchen counter?

Lenny (00:45:27):
We got a rice cooker and the rest is hidden away.

Christopher Lochhead (00:45:33):
Perfect. So what's Lomi? Lomi is the category designer of the smart home composter. Imagine a device that's one and a half or twice the size of a good size toaster. And what Lomi does is you take your food scraps, and it turns out that depending on whose numbers you want to believe, in America, we throw away somewhere between 40 to 60% of our food. And it turns out that food garbage, food waste is some of the most damaging to the environment. So what does Lomi do? You take your food scraps, you dump it into Lomi, you fill that shit up, Lomi's got a button on the front, you press that button, and what used to take three to six months to compost gets composted in three to six hours.

(00:46:29):
And even, this is weird, it smells good to me. Lomi did not say that, "we're better garbage, that we're different garbage, that we're better recycling." What they said was, "We are a different way of solving this huge problem." And they use both personal motivation, nobody likes throwing out garbage, nobody likes a big mess in their kitchen, et cetera, and an altruistic vision, which is... And oh by the way, if we do this, we will do something that governments heretofore have not been able to do, which is take a massive amount of environment hurting gases out of the atmosphere. And it turns out because of global climate change that we're creating more and more sand and we have dirt traces. Lomi dirt has been shown to be amongst the most nutrient rich dirt in the world. Here is a company with a breakthrough technology that truly makes a difference in the world with a business model that allows them to build a highly profitable high growth business.

(00:47:48):
And the way they got there was by designing a new category and showing the world why, by making room in your tight kitchen for this new device, you'll make a difference for your family and the world. And if all they had done was what, by way of example, Dean Kamen did when he launched the segue, which is, isn't this cool? Nothing would've happened. So my point is, the Lomi guys designed a product, a company, and a new market category. They created demand out of nothing for, I think the average price is around 400 bucks. The sum total of the market for smart home composters when they launched was fucking zero. And their vision for the new category was so compelling, Jay-Z was one of their first investors.

Lenny (00:48:53):
I have their site up. Thinking about this framework of, frame it, name it, claim it, they framed the problem in this unique way of... Is it the framing of the problem or framing of a solution? The framing step, best way to think about that.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:09):
There's something in category design called languaging, which is the strategic use of language to change thinking. And a mistake that a lot of entrepreneurs make is they use old language to describe their new thing. And we can't use so much new language that nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about, so we have to meet the category where it is and bring them forward, but we have to create new language. Can I share with you one of my favorite, most recent, favorite category design stories in this regard?

Lenny (00:49:42):
Please.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:44):
You've been on an elevator, yes?

Lenny (00:49:45):
Yes.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:47):
Have you ever looked at the floor and seen a logo on the floor of the elevator?

Lenny (00:49:53):
I can't recall. I imagine it.

Christopher Lochhead (00:49:55):
Well, if you do, you'll more than likely see this name, Otis. Otis Elevator. Most people don't know why Otis is the category queen of elevators. Well, here's why. Elisha Otis invented the elevator. Now, pre-Elisha, there were no skyscrapers. Because how could you get to the top floor? How could you build the top floor, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So when he creates the elevator, there's no known problem for it to solve. So he demonstrates it, people think it's cool. He shows it at like fares and shit. Because the big problem with prior elevators was they would crash. And so he built this safety system to catch them if the wiring would crash. And the category name, he actually used, Lenny, he called it the safety elevator to address the current problem in the space, which is... I don't know. People still went, "That's interesting, but why do I need a safety elevator?" It's a solution with no problem.

(00:51:14):
So what does he do? Languaging. And in category design, one of the breakthroughs is this thing called a point of view, which helps you frame, claim and name a problem and educate the world on why they should move from the way it is to, we call them frotos, from to, a new and different way. So Elisha has to make the market, there's zero demand. It's what many of our smart VC friends call a zero billion market, which is what you want. So what does Elisha call it? The vertical... Railway

Lenny (00:51:57):
Beautiful.

Christopher Lochhead (00:51:59):
And people understand what a railway does. It moves people and shit this way. And he said, "Great, we've now got a vertical elevator that moves people and shit this way." And if you have a vertical elevator-

Lenny (00:52:11):
Vertical railway.

Christopher Lochhead (00:52:12):
A vertical railway, thank you. You can have a new category of building. This is no different than anybody today, for example, in the technology space, who's building a new part of the technology stack for AI. So if you've got a new important security layer for AI that enables a new highly secure AI application. From a languaging perspective, if you just use existing languaging, you'll be like Elisha in the beginning where people go, "That's really cool, man. Fucking A, didn't think that was technically possible. Wow. It's like you've broken gravity, dude, incredible. Don't know why we'd ever need this. See you." And he goes, "Wait a minute, wait a minute. What if it was a vertical railway?" "Well, what could we do with a vertical railway?"

(00:53:09):
This is why thinking matters. The way you think about the problem, the way you frame claim and name the problem. One of the core tenets, Lenny, in category design is listen to the words. Listen to the words. And when you listen to the words, you will hear things that you don't normally. And so he created new languaging, what in category design is called a point of view, to frame, claim and name a problem, which is, how do I move up and down versus across land? And in so doing the aperture of people's minds created what you could think of as new mental scaffolding for a whole new kind of innovation. And thanks to Elisha Otis, we have tall buildings.

Lenny (00:54:01):
I really like this idea of languaging. Are there any other examples come to mind, awesome examples of languaging in action that worked out?

Christopher Lochhead (00:54:07):
I got a bazillion of them. Another one of my favorites. When Starbucks first starts a coffee is 10 cents. You sit there and you go, "We can't make money at 10 cents." That doesn't make sense, right? Unit economics don't work for what we're trying to get done. If the ASP in the industry is 10 cents, we want to have an ASP of three bucks. Fuck. Well, here's the aha. It's very hard to charge three bucks for a thing that everybody currently pays a quarter for, if you call it the same thing.

(00:54:50):
So they create new languaging, they teach, they literally teach consumers new language. That's why you and I walk into Starbucks and say, "I'd like a double grande latte, please." 25 years ago, that was not languaging that you and I used. And they use it as a mechanism for radical differentiation and radical value/price differentiation. And they made up the fucking word. It sounds kind of Italian, vente. But the truth is, by the way, it's a milkshake, but that's a whole other conversation. They're the number one milk seller in the country. They're a milk company, not a coffee company. But that's, again, a whole other conversation. The point being, if you want to charge three bucks for something that heretofore has been 10 cents or a quarter, change the language. And you know it's Starbucks language. Where I live, there's a shit ton of new hipster independent coffee shop type places. Where they paint the Mona Lisa in your latte before-

Christopher Lochhead (00:56:00):
... where they paint the Mona Lisa in your latte before they give it to you and all that shit. If you walk into one of those hipster places and ask for a double grande latte, the super hipster gal or guy behind the counter with the nose ring and shit is going to give you a bit of a grizzle, because you are using Starbucks languaging in their location, and that's the other breakthrough. This is really important in the technology industry, the company that creates the languaging for the category wins.

(00:56:39):
Oh, you see that today, OpenAI. Not that long ago you did not hear the term large language model. Correct?

Lenny (00:56:51):
Correct.

Christopher Lochhead (00:56:52):
That was not a term we were talking about.

Lenny (00:56:53):
That's right.

Christopher Lochhead (00:56:56):
And today the entire industry is talking about LLMs. Here's another thing that they created, training data. Well, those of us who've been around for a long time, we understand what data is. We know what a database is, we know what data in motion is, we know what data at rest is. We know what structured data is, we know what unstructured data is, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

(00:57:19):
I'm not a data expert by any stretch, but I've been in the industry for 37 years, I know some about shit data. We'd never heard the term training data, and I'm still frankly looking for a breakthrough in languaging to describe it to people, because I think when most people realize the difference between data/content and training data, there's a massive breakthrough that can occur there. The languaging is still not sufficient, but we're getting there.

(00:57:53):
New languaging creates new thinking, and a demarcation point in language creates a demarcation point in thinking, which can create a demarcation point in perceived value, and she, who changes and or creates net new value perceptions wins.

(00:59:20):
I think you've made a very compelling case for why people should design a new category. To give people one more tactical tool for coming up with and figuring out the category they want to go after and framing it and even naming it, you mentioned this idea of having a point of view. Maybe that's the best way to approach this question, or maybe there's another framework of just how can people best think through and spend time thinking about what this new category they should be creating ends up being?

Christopher Lochhead (00:59:51):
Great question, Lenny. Two things, at least. First, spend more time on the problem than the solution. There's a very early stage, security startup I'm working with right now in the AI space that's doing absolutely mind-boggling things, and the founders have incredible backgrounds with large transaction systems and deep security, just an incredible company.

(01:00:21):
I had a call yesterday with the founder and some folks on the product team just getting an update on where they're at and this and that and the other, and we're sort of starting to want to talk to people externally. We've raised a seed round, VCs are coming, they're very ... Anyway, we're sort of slowly starting to want to come into the world and begin to have a conversation.

(01:00:46):
The founder CEO sends me a text yesterday and says, "I'd like you to, if you're open to it, have a call with so-and-so. He's a very important person, knows a lot about our space, blah blah. Known him for a long time," dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Great. I said, "It sounds wonderful, but why? What's the purpose of my conversation with so-and-so?" The founder literally said to me, "I would love it if you would be willing to invest some time in listening to some of our customers to hear from their perspective what the problem is and what the solution could be, not just from me and our team."

(01:01:27):
That is a founder who's obsessed with the problem. That's the first piece. The second piece of advice I'll give you, I mentioned Mike Maples, he's got a very powerful way of framing this. He calls it backcasting as distinct from forecasting. You're nodding your head, you're familiar with this.

Lenny (01:01:54):
Yeah, I've read this in length in the show notes, it's amazing.

Christopher Lochhead (01:01:56):
Yeah. Here's the idea. What most people do is you and I are entrepreneurs, we have this idea for a product, this problem we can solve. We think we're going to be bazillionaires, we think we're going to help a lot of people, we think we're going to have a lot of fun, and so we have at it. And whether we realize it or not, the mental scaffolding we use goes like this: Lenny and Christopher are sitting here now, we have these big dreams. We think, let's say, five years out into the future, "What do we want to do? Oh [inaudible 01:02:32]. Why don't we go through all the dreams? Great." Then we ask ourselves, most of this is subconscious and then it shows up in business plans and other things, "What do we need to do to get from here to there?" Have you ever done any backcountry hiking, Lenny?

Lenny (01:01:56):
Yeah, I have.

Christopher Lochhead (01:02:52):
Yeah, so if you and I were going to go on a four or five-day trip in the Sierras, we would have a start point, right?

Lenny (01:03:00):
Yeah, absolutely.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:02):
And we'd know where we were coming out, right?

Lenny (01:03:03):
Mm-hmm.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:04):
And we'd have way points along the way, yes?

Lenny (01:03:06):
Yeah, probably.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:09):
Because we knew we were going to be out four days or six days or whatever, we would try to plan our food appropriately.

Lenny (01:03:14):
Absolutely.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:14):
And the whole plan would be predicated on "We're going to start here and we're going to end here," and what do we need to do to get from where we start to where we end, yes?

Lenny (01:03:25):
Mm-hmm.

Christopher Lochhead (01:03:26):
Now, when going on a backcountry hike, that's a very smart fucking thing to do, because if you've ever been on a backcountry hike and you're four days in only to realize you don't have enough food, that's an experience you don't want to recreate. Okay, turns out that while that's highly effective for a hike, it is intergalactic disaster for a startup. Here's why. Your point of reference is everything. Thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking.

(01:03:59):
When we do it that way, mentally we are standing in the present, which is an extension of the past, and we're saying, "What do we need to do to go from this present to the different future we want, and what are the obstacles in the way?" Here's the mental scaffolding. That's forecasting, here's backcasting.

(01:04:26):
We do an exercise, we abandon everything. In category design you get taught to what's called reject the premise, so I reject everything about the way that it is, all of it. You and I now envision this future five years out and everything's gone incredibly, it's exceeded our expectations. We make that true in our minds. We write out, we brainstorm out "What's it going to be like? What kind of technology are we selling? What are we doing for customers? How big's our company? How many people will hire?" Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Then we say, "Okay, standing in that future, five years out, looking back to the present, what did we do to make this different future happen?" That's category design. That's how you unshackle yourself from the past. See, one of the biggest disservices in our industry is this word disrupt. "Oh, [inaudible 01:05:26] we're going to go disrupt the engineering industry." Nah. Well, if you're disrupting something, by definition, your reference point is the something. And when your reference point is an existing thing, your reference point is the past. If we want to be able to think in unconstrained ways about a radically different future, the more we drag the past forward, the worse off we are. What reject the premise teaches us is let's forget everything we know and start fresh. My friend, a legendary designer, John Bielenberg, does this course on innovation and design with kids in university. He does this multi-week exercise and the objective of the exercise, Lenny, is design a bicycle. That's the objective. And there's only one design point. It cannot be rideable.

(01:06:25):
And the reason John makes him do that, his philosophy, he calls it thinking wrong. That's his version, if you will, of reject the premise. The reason for it is when you take away the premise, it must be rideable, you open up the aperture for legendary new thinking, radically different possibilities, radically different futures. This is the mistake that many, many entrepreneurs make, is whether they realize it or not, what they're doing is incremental better and they're fighting for market share, fighting for existing demand with something that's incrementally better. And the reality is that's why most entrepreneurs fail. Now, you could fail doing it exponentially different, it sounds medically insane to say "What you want is a zero billion dollars market." However, as crazy as it sounds, it's the only thing that leads to meaningful success. And the proof is in the data.

Lenny (01:07:34):
Yeah. You talk about this in your writing, that on the surface it feels very hard and expensive to design a category, build a category, convince everyone this is a new problem. But your point is there's no other option really if you want to build a large business. Is that right?

Christopher Lochhead (01:07:49):
Correct. And the other thing is people say, "Oh, it's really expensive and it takes an amount of time." As compared to what? You've lived a lot of your life in the product world, yes? As have I. Well, if you ask smart VCs, if you ask Brian Roberts at Venrock, the number one healthcare tech investor in the world, I believe he says it's eight to 10 years for a product to really have some maturity and be really stable. And I don't know whether he's right or not, but he's a super smart guy. We know how long does it take to create a legendary culture, how long does it take to get a legendary innovative business model to really hum. "Ah, it's mainly hard." Well, so is building a product, so is building a company, so is raising VC, so is doing sales, so is doing marketing, so is doing HR. If you want to be easy, go work at the fucking DMV. That's point A.

(01:08:53):
Point B is the reality, Lenny, when you look at it, the vast majority of innovation comes from startups. People say, "Only big companies can do this." Listen, my collaborator partner Eddie Yoon, is the Obiwan Kenobi of category design in the Global 2000 Arena and particularly on the consumer side. And he will tell you that most of these major companies... And he's worked for, you name a big food company, you name a big beverage company, he's worked for many of them. They fail miserably. The reality is six people with a small investment from a rich uncle can stand something up that has the potential to be worth $3 trillion dollars. That's what Apple is.

(01:09:52):
And I sat there with Don Valentine and asked him about why he signed the check to Steve and Steve, and he said it was the stupidest use case he ever saw. The use case was a stay-at-home mom, keeping track of her recipes on the Apple personal computer. This is the stupidest use case ever. However, Don could see the potential in the category and in the guy's willingness to go get after it. And so for a VC, if you're going to raise money, the VCs who invest in early stage mass potential companies are the ones who see your different future.

Lenny (01:10:40):
Along those lines, I had this note that you had this quote around product market fit and it's this hot take that product market fit is a very dangerous idea. I'd love for you to speak to that, because I think most people are in the opposite camp that it's the only thing that matters. Why do you think it's such a dangerous idea?

Christopher Lochhead (01:11:01):
There's a bunch of these product myths. Product led growth is another one, but let's go to product market fit. And God bless Mark Andreessen, he's the guy that framed it. And Kevin just wrote a really super thoughtful piece on why it's backwards, and I'm happy to send that to you if you want. Kevin Maney, genius. Here's the aha, again, category design principles. Listen to the words, product, market, fit. Product market fit. Now, let's think, what there is for me to do is find a way to fit my product into a market.

(01:11:48):
Pretty simple way to determine or to distill product market fit. And what product market fit has come to mean is, we're a brew pub, you and I want to start a craft beer place like everybody else on the West Coast, and we're going to make a bunch of samples and shit, and we're going to feed those samples to our friends and to our ideal customer profile that I learned from Lenny. And if enough people amongst my friend group and my ideal customer group say, "That's a yummy IPA, I like it," then we're going to build it. And then if people start buying that IPA, we have, and these are the words people use, "achieved product market fit."

(01:12:43):
Okay, well, Threads achieved product market fit faster than any product in the history of the world. Here's the aha, categories make products not the other way around. What you want is you want to design a market category for your product, not fit your product into a market category. And the problem is, our industry, like many others, but the tech industry, is full of product bigots, because they really, really, really, really, really believe, like they believe in the availability of oxygen, the best product wins. They really believe it. And they believe what marketing's job is, "Could you put a demo on our website and get a demo? Can we get a viral video that's a demo? Because once people see how much better, faster, cheaper, smaller, bigger, whatever our thing is, they're going to buy it," and they don't. What they buy is a new insight around a problem/opportunity that requires a different solution. That's what they buy. Here's another simple example. This is the one I hear right now a lot, "What we need now the story, we need a story brand. The number one thing you can do in marketing as a startup founder is to share your startup founder journey. Share your journey." This is all the shit we're hearing. We've been hearing this for a while. Well, guess what? No one gives a fuck about your journey. They really don't. You know what they care about? Themselves. Their problems, their needs, their opportunities. For our book, Snow Leopard, we did the first ever comprehensive data science research ever done using Nielsen data to study nonfiction books. And we know that because what Nielsen told us, and we had to sign an NDA that would choke a horse in terms of what we can say and can't say about the data. But one of the things we wanted to understand is what categories of business books sold and which categories didn't and why. We can get into all that if you want, but here's the aha. Guess what the number one category of business books, nonfiction books is by a mile.

Lenny (01:15:13):
Oh my god. Sales? Marketing, marketing-sales. No.

Christopher Lochhead (01:15:19):
Personal growth.

Lenny (01:15:20):
Okay, that makes sense. Self-help.

Christopher Lochhead (01:15:22):
Self-help. And number two, personal finance. Biographies are way down on the list. The point being, no one cares about our product. No one cares that it's 25 mega flips faster, cheaper, whatever, they don't care. You know what they care about? Them, their needs, their wants, their problems. And categories are about customers and their wants, needs, problems and opportunities. Branding and marketing is about our product. And the greatest innovators in the world don't stop at innovating a product or technology. They design a new innovative market category where they standalone.

Lenny (01:16:12):
We're definitely going along, which I expected. And we've actually gone through most of the questions I had, but I have just a few more to close out the conversation. One is positioning. That's something you hear a lot about. How do you think about positioning versus categorying? Are they essentially the same thing? Is positioning just a way to phrase and describe your category? How should people think about that?

Christopher Lochhead (01:16:32):
What positioning today has become is essentially how do I tell a story about my shit in a unique way, in a compelling way? That's really what people mean when they say positioning. The parts they never stop to consider, again, listen to the words positioning as it relates to what? Because you, again, listen to the words and fucking think, "You position against competitors." How do we position against the competitors? That's a phrase people use. The question is, what are you positioning against? And the answer to that question almost all of the time is competition. If you're doing positioning in that context, you just decided you're fighting for 24% of the demand designed by somebody else. And we think in the tech space where one company earns two thirds of the economics, if that's your starting point, you fuck yourself from the start. To put it simply, positioning in the modern context is for losers. That is to say people who are fighting over the 24%. That's positioning.

Lenny (01:18:15):
I love it. Getting spicy over here.

Christopher Lochhead (01:18:17):
Well, it's factually correct. People go, "Oh, [inaudible 01:18:21]." Okay, so you mean to tell me that in tech one company doesn't take two thirds of the economics? Okay, believe that. And you can believe gravity doesn't exist. It does, but you can believe that Bigfoots are installing misters on 5G towers to make us all sick, if you want. You can believe anything you want, it doesn't make it true. What's true is one company wins and everybody else gets fucked. That's what's true. Look at any space you want. You want to go back to your list? We can go through the list. Positioning has become sort of category design for the cowards. It's like, "Well, I know that we could really be as radical as to create our own space, so let's just see if we can carve off our little niche over here." Okay, great.

Lenny (01:19:20):
A big part of positioning, just to expand on this a little bit, is differentiation. Differentiating yourself. People always talk about the importance of differentiation. Do you see that as the same potential pitfall, or how do you think about differentiation?

Christopher Lochhead (01:19:34):
Okay, this is really, really powerful. In category design, we don't compete, period, full stop at the brand to brand or product to product level. Category designers do compete, but not against a product, not against a company, not against a brand. Category designers compete against the status quo. Let me be specific. There's a category called cycling. You look like you might be a biker, Lenny, are you?

Lenny (01:20:09):
Very casually, mostly an e-bike.

Christopher Lochhead (01:20:13):
Those are really fun.

Lenny (01:20:14):
They're so fun. Mountain bike. Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (01:20:16):
But you've been on a mountain bike. You've been on a road bike, you've gone out with friends, done this, right?

Lenny (01:20:20):
Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (01:20:21):
Anybody who bikes on any kind of regular basis has been in an accident. And if you bike on a real regular basis, you've been in an accident with a vehicle that was not caused by you. That's true for every person I know that rides a bike on any regular basis, myself included. All of a sudden a new category shows up, and that new category is called indoor biking classes. And the category designer is a company called spinning.

(01:20:53):
And they say, "Hey, biking's great. It's an incredible source of exercise, but you don't want to get killed doing it, so come take a class." And what they're doing when they do that, they're competing category to category, not brand or product to brand. And that's a strategy that's called damming the demand. What does a dam do? There's a bunch of water running in the direction, a dam takes that water, stops it and moves it, does something to it. Interrupts it and changes it. Here's what spinning does. They say, "Why risk your life on a bike when you can take a wonderful class and not have to worry about it and get your exercise?" What dam the demand, Lenny, is you thought you wanted this, but what you really need is that.

(01:21:52):
Then what happens? The next iteration in that space comes from Peloton. Again, when Peloton launches, they don't say, "Hey, our bikes are better than spinning bikes. Our bikes are 12 mega flips, faster, cheaper." They don't do any of that shit. They don't shit on spinning, they don't attack spinning, they don't attack road biking, they don't do any of that stuff. They say, "Why drive to the gym when you could do it at home?" They dam the demand for spinning, they don't compete against it. And they reframe the problem called "How do I get a great workout in a group environment without getting killed?" And they achieve that massive success.

(01:22:41):
And I can give you many other examples. The mistake is competing directly product to product. The enemy is the status quo. That is to say the way it is now. If you go back to Lomi, the enemy, the way it is now, the status quo, is a nasty garbage in your kitchen that stinks and smells and gets all over the floor that you have to drag to the green bin and then the squirrels and the fucking raccoons eat it. That's the personal upset. And the environmental one is, we're destroying the planet. No, by the way, rather than destroy the planet, why not create this super awesome compost dirt? In category design, we call that a from to a Frodo. Category designers are leading the world from the way it is to a new and different way. They're not saying, "My carbide ingulator is better than their carbide ingulator."

(01:23:32):
Here's a simple example. This is another reason the word disrupt doesn't work. Les Paul is the innovator of the electric guitar. Today most guitar players have an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar. Matter of fact, most guitar players have more than one, very few guitar players, some, but very few said, "Oh, now that the electric guitar is invented, fuck the acoustic guitar." Very, very rare. The net new category called electric...

Christopher Lochhead (01:24:00):
So the net new category called electric guitar as opposed to the prior category, acoustic guitar, actually increases the overall guitar TAM. Doesn't disrupt shit. So in that case, you're actually creating net new demand. In the Peloton example, you're both creating that new demand and you're getting your start. And this is where I think a lot of the discussion that you have and a lot of your work, Lenny, around growth, is really powerful, because what's really going on when growth works is effective digital damning of demand. That's what's really going on, when it works.

Lenny (01:24:41):
I think somewhere maybe wrote this, "Damn the TAM" is an awesome phrase. If you haven't, you should use that. Damning the TAM, increasing the TAM. So you have a number of books you put out. I'm going to link to all these. Play Bigger, I think, was your first, Niche Down is the other. And your newest book, I believe is your newest book, is the 22 Laws of Category Design. So maybe just as a last question, can you just share a few of these laws, maybe two or three of your favorite laws from the book just to give people a sense of the book?

Christopher Lochhead (01:25:09):
I think we talked about law number one, which, in a lot of ways, is probably the most important. Another one to think about is something we call the magic triangle, which we've touched on, but maybe not explicitly, which is, in order to build a legendary company, you've got to get product, company, and category right at the right time. And so some people hear the category design discussion and they think it's somehow pejorative to product as if product doesn't matter. The reason for category design is because we love the products. Products fail because they don't get category designed. So I think the aha of the magic triangle is product, company, and category are equal in importance, and so getting that right I think is very powerful.

(01:26:05):
I'm just riffing off the top of my head. I don't have it in front of me. Another example is lightning strikes versus peanut butter. So what most marketers do is they take their marketing budget for the year, they quarterize it, and maybe there's slight variance in the quarters, but essentially it's a similar amount of spend. And they do campaigns. And they do "keep the lights on" and maybe they launch a product and maybe they have a big push around the product. And they're trying to drive the funnel and they're trying to deliver sales or deliver leads, B2B, doesn't matter. And that's what they do. And what they don't realize, Lenny, is that approach, that peanut butter approach, is predicated on almost 100-year-old mental scaffolding and marketing called reach and frequency. And what reach and frequency was about, which was, I want to get my shit in front of the most amount of people the most often possible.

(01:27:07):
And if you listen to a lot of the shysters and hustle porn stars, the Gary VDs, and this is of the world, "You got to release 400 pieces of content today on every platform." All this stupidity. That's just a reswizzle of reach and frequency from over 50 years ago in the new medium. Well, it turns out reach and frequency doesn't work. Because the number of marketing messages we get is massive, they're experts who say we get up to 60,000 a day, whether it's logos on coffee cups or ads on the internet and everything in between. And so it's virtually impossible to stand out in a reach and frequency mode. Now I'm not saying you shouldn't be doing keep the lights on marketing. Of course you need to do keep the lights on marketing. But, here's what the lightning strike model and category design teaches us. I'd rather matter for one week a year than be irrelevant for the rest of the year.

(01:28:07):
And so what we did, candidly Lenny, was we ripped off Hollywood's model for launching movies. We said, "What if you did that as a software company? What if you launched a thing, be it a product or something else, the way Hollywood launches a movie?" And so what a lightning strike is about is getting very, very clear, if you go back to your ICP thing, "Who's our ideal customer? Where is that customer? Where does she hang out?" Ideally, in the digital world first. One of your recent episodes, I was listening to the Growth Hacker Gala, how she went on to Reddit and stuff. That's a well-known strategy and I love that strategy. Go hang out where they are, put something provocative and engaging in front of them, and matter in that moment. So the idea of a lightning strike is, if you are in our target audience for that day or that two days, we are going to be all over you.

(01:29:09):
We're going to be undeniable. And so we put a disproportionate amount of our effort, if we're in B2B, probably one to two lightning strikes a year. If we're in B2C, two to three. One a quarter if you're a really big company. It's hard to pull off one a quarter if you're a smaller company. And much more than that, if not a lightning strike, it starts to blur back into peanut butter. But, that is a very powerful concept. On the execution side for marketers, that's different. The other thing I'd say and probably should have started here, so I'm a three-time public company CMO. I've advised over 50 venture-backed companies in category design and marketing. Guess what I've never seen in a marketing plan ever?

Lenny (01:29:59):
What's that?

Christopher Lochhead (01:30:00):
Word of mouth. This boggles our minds, those of us in category design, because WOM is was and always will be the most powerful form of marketing. And in the native digital world, WOM can spread in a way that was never possible on the analog world for all the reasons we all understand. So if you take the concept of a lightning strike, then you take the concept of a category point of view that is all about frame naming and claiming a problem. And then there's one other concept I'll introduce.

(01:30:32):
It sits next to your ideal customer profile. It's what in category design we call super consumers. So it turns out that in most categories, roughly eight to 10% of the buyers are responsible for the vast majority of the profits. And more importantly, they are the zeitgeist. They are the thought leaders in the industry. They are the customers, the users, the purveyors of whatever the thing is that others look up to as being the ones to admire, the ones to aspire to, the best practices, et cetera, et cetera. That's a super consumer. Okay. So in category design, when you understand who your supers are, i.e. your ideal customer profile, you understand where they are primarily in the native digital world, how do we go hang out? And remind me what that gal's name was? I thought she was awesome.

Lenny (01:31:23):
Meltem. Meltem Kuran Berkowitz.

Christopher Lochhead (01:31:23):
Melson?

Lenny (01:31:26):
Meltem. M-E-L-T-E-M.

Christopher Lochhead (01:31:29):
What a name. That's a great name. Anyway, I thought Meltem was awesome. She's absolutely on point. So we know who our ideal customer, aka super consumers are. We know where they hang out in the native digital world. We have a radically compelling different point of view about framing, claiming, and naming a problem that, if we do effectively, we'll resonate with them. That's why we spend time crafting that POV. So we evangelize the problem. We participate in a native digital community where they already are. And we do it from the perspective of not a marketer, not a seller, an educator. We're teaching people about a new and different way to think about an existing problem or a problem they hadn't thought of, that when they have an aha moment, because we articulate it well with our point of view, they go, "Oh, tell me more about that problem."

(01:32:21):
Right? As they do that, we take an education standpoint, mental framework to it. We open them up, we participate, and sooner or later somebody says, "Huh, tell me again what you do." And bam, away that we go. And here's the aha. When you understand supers, you understand the targeting, you understand a radically different point of view, reframing the problem, presenting a radically different solution. Well guess what? It's the ultimate growth engine. And you can grow for a very small amount of money. You could send email to 300 people and drive a breakthrough in sales.

(01:33:05):
Why? Because when you take this approach, you're not just driving near-term revenue, very, very important, you are driving WOM. A big part of why you want to have a point of view that can be articulated very quickly is marketing's job is to put the right words in the right mouths and to get that WOM to scale. And so when we have a category POV, that's about them, not us. Remember, brands are about us. Categories are about customers. We care about what they care about. And so when you have a powerful category POV, that drives WOM. And then when you do that in the native digital world, you get a tremendous amount of uplift from native digital viral WOM. And category design is the only business strategy whose primary execution focus starts with WOM.

Lenny (01:34:06):
What an awesome way to wrap up our conversation. It's basically a very tight go-to-market strategy is what you just shared. For folks that want to dig further, I'll just share a few of the places they could learn more. And then Neil, at the end, I'll ask you where to point people. But, you have an awesome Substack category, pirates. That's substack.com. You have your books, which I think maybe the best way to, I guess you tell me, is to find them as go to your last name. com, lochhead.com, L-O-C-H-head.com. Is that right?

Christopher Lochhead (01:34:34):
Yeah. And of course you can go to category pirates.com.

Lenny (01:34:36):
Okay. Even easier. Amazing. So we have the lightning round coming up. Is there anything else you want to share as closing words or advice before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Christopher Lochhead (01:34:47):
Yes, I do.

Lenny (01:34:48):
Okay. Let's do it.

Christopher Lochhead (01:34:51):
So I'm 55 years old, Lenny. I started my first company when I was 18. I got thrown out of school. I don't have a GED. And I've been in the tech industry the whole time. And the first thing I would share is anything's possible. Don't listen to anybody who shits on you. I've a chat on as much as you could possibly imagine. I have four or five different learning differences. ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was told I couldn't read. I was certainly told I couldn't write. I've written 14 number one fucking bestsellers, et cetera, et cetera. And so my point is, if you are somebody for whom you want to spend your professional time working on the exponential different as opposed to the incremental better, which I got to believe is a meaningful percentage of the people who consume your shit, if you want to work on the incremental better, incremental better is important.

(01:35:52):
I want the Boeing engineers working on the incremental better. I don't want the air traffic control system that's the exponential different. No. And a lot of incremental improvement over time can be exponential. So if you're a product manager and you're running a highly successful product with a massive install base, and you're looking at your next rev, and you're trying to figure out of the 472 features that you could build. What are the 26 that really matter? And you want to go talk to your customers to find out what those incremental improvements are and to stack rank them into all that good. PRD, MRD, IUD, all that shit. There's a big place in the world for all of that. It's incredibly important. That's not category design. So with that said, I think, Lenny, we are at the greatest time in history for our industry.

(01:36:48):
I think all the indicators show that the amount of innovation that is going to happen in the next five years will eclipse the amount of innovation that happened in the last 20 years. It's accelerating. AI is insanely exciting, dangerous, concerning. Do we need to focus on the downside? Do we need to be smart? Do we need to be thoughtful? Do we need to learn? Do we need to work with regulators and legislators? Absolutely. Could it go horribly? Oh, sure. But, that's always true. AI feels a little bit different, but it's always true. And for the record, the Luddites are always wrong. The point being now is the greatest time in history to be a creator, to be an entrepreneur, to be a marketer. I've been a marketer for my entire adult life. It's never been greater than it is right now. And so here's the big thing that I would share.

(01:37:43):
If you are somebody for whom you want to make an exponential difference, you want to innovate, you want to create new value where there wasn't, you want to have a legendary career where you can look back on your career and go, "You know what? I was part of this and that. And I was on this team." Now is the greatest time in history. And what I would say to you is the future needs you. Most people are not working on the exponential different.

(01:38:14):
And so the future of our world requires that the innovative people, that the entrepreneurial people stand up, take advantage of these incredible technologies. And a lot of people, particularly in my age group, Lenny, shit on millennials, Gen Z, what are lovingly referred to as native digitals. Absolutely not. I'm inspired by them. And I think the next generation of our entrepreneurs will be our greatest generation of entrepreneurs. So my point is, now's the time. The future needs you. Don't listen to any of the bullshit. I don't care what the boo birds say. Absolutely, go for it because there's never been a greater time to design and dominate new categories of innovation than right now.

Lenny (01:39:02):
I love that message. You're just passion and energy for creating and inspiring comes through really clearly in all your writing. And so I love hearing it in person. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Christopher Lochhead (01:39:22):
Richard Bach, Illusions. And then in terms of business books, I'll share with you one, because I know people recommend all the same shit. I'll share with you one that I think it may still be in print, but if not, it's easy to get. Mark McCormack's What They Don't Teach You At The Harvard Business School. So on the personal side, Richard Bach, Illusions. And for one that you may not have heard of Mark McCormack, What They Don't Teach You At The Harvard Business School.

Lenny (01:39:55):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Christopher Lochhead (01:39:59):
Oh, right now we're watching Designing Anna or Inventing Anna or whatever that's called. So that's been fascinating to watch. I think it's been incredibly well done.

Lenny (01:40:10):
What a wild story, that one. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates when you're hiring people?

Christopher Lochhead (01:40:18):
So there's actually two. And I'll start with the second most important interview question, which I think is the most important question. But in a job interview setting, for me it's the second most important. And that is, it there anything else? And you know this as a podcaster. I end every single one of my podcasts with, is there anything else? And the interesting thing about that question, you can spend three hours with somebody talking about very important shit. You can think you got all the detail. You could have asked all the questions about the technical architecture and the campaign and the distribution and I don't know what.

(01:40:56):
And at the very end you say, "Hey, Susan, before we wrap, is there anything else?" And often, Lenny, the most important thing for that person to communicate comes out then. It happens so often, it's bizarre. I use that in medical situations. Family member is in the hospital going for an operation. "Okay, doc, tell me." I tell you all the shit. Is there anything else? I will tell you that eight times out of 10, the most important thing about the surgery with your loved one will come after that question. I will even use it during a conversation as we transition from various different points.

(01:41:37):
So in an interview situation, maybe you're asking somebody about their background. You might say, "Well, is there anything else about your background you think I should know?" It's the most powerful open question. But in an job interview situation, it's my second favorite. My first favorite is, so Lenny, are you legendary?

Lenny (01:42:01):
You want me to answer that?

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:03):
You can if you like or not.

Lenny (01:42:05):
No.

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:06):
But, the answer to that question...

Lenny (01:42:08):
What are you looking for?

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:09):
... Is always radically illustrative. I'm not looking for anything. I'm looking for your answer. Some people will say, "Yes." And they'll tell you why. Some people will say, "Well, that's a big word." Whatever they're going to say. But, it is a purposely provocative question with one of, I think, the most powerful words in the English language, because I want to get a read on that person and how they respond to a purposely provocative question about themselves.

Lenny (01:42:42):
Amazing. Okay, just a couple more questions. What's a favorite life motto that you like to repeat yourself or share with other people?

Christopher Lochhead (01:42:50):
If you're lucky enough to make it to the top of a mountain, throw down a fucking rope. And for me on that, Lenny, I'm somebody who has had and continues to have a radical amount of love and support in my life. When I was young, I started with nothing and I got thrown out of school. And I didn't know until I was 21 because when I was young, learning differences weren't a thing. And by the way, the way most of the world and education system deals with learning differences is completely fucked. But, that's a different conversation. It's definitely improved, but it is nowhere near what it needs to be. And so I just think that we should never be held back by those views of others. And so we need to be unencumbered.

Lenny (01:43:42):
I love it. Final question. It's a dumb question. Maybe to lead to something fun. You're a category pirate. Do you have a favorite real pirate?

Christopher Lochhead (01:43:51):
I have actually a lot of favorite pirates. I'll tell you about one of them. His name is Tony Etherington, but virtually nobody calls him Tony. Virtually everybody calls him Doris. And Doris is a legendary surfer and surf explorer from the Gold Coast of Australia. And I went on my first ever boat tour, surf adventure in Indonesia with Tony.

Lenny (01:44:22):
You make this giggle.

Christopher Lochhead (01:44:30):
There's a horrible story I'm thinking of telling you. Anyway, you haven't been with a real pirate until you've been in stormy seas at night with Doris smoking cigarettes, drinking Jack Daniels in the bridge thinking maybe we're going to die, but this guy's probably not going to let that happen. And so Doris Etherington would be one of my top pirates of all time. And he's got the voice. And he's got the attitude. When I was having problems surfing, he would say to me, "All right, sit you down mate." Always smoking a cigarette. He's like, "I'd smoke long if we could have ciggyed up now." He goes, "You paddle out, wait for the biggest wave, lean into it, and get right up on it."

(01:45:21):
And so in our world, get right up on it is has become an expression for go for it. So I think we can all heed the words of Doris and get right up on it.

Lenny (01:45:36):
I love that this question led to something fun and interesting. Chris, thank you so much for being here. This conversation was entertaining, insightful, spicy, fun, funny, everything I hoped it would be. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and keep reading? And then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Christopher Lochhead (01:45:54):
Probably categorypirates.com is the simplest spot to go. And how listeners can be useful to me?

Lenny (01:46:03):
Yeah.

Christopher Lochhead (01:46:04):
It's what we talked about a moment ago. The future needs you. And the future needs the people who have the courage to make a difference, because the people who are different are the ones who have made the biggest difference. Every time. And we live in a world where we are rewarded for our sameness, for fitting in. Our education system teaches us what we're trying to do is find our place in the world. And listen, some of us do. I know people who wanted to be a vet from the time they were kids, and that's the path they chose. And they became vets. And they love it. And they're wonderful people. And they have great careers. And they make a giant difference. And they've always known. And fucking a. And so if you are somebody for whom you have found your place in the world, congratulations. That's awesome. And we also know, particularly in the innovator, entrepreneur, creator, marketer world, many of us, there was no place.

(01:47:13):
And so my hope is that you either find your place or if you realize there's no place for you, that you further realize that you can make your place in the world. And fundamentally, that's what category design is about. It's about making a distinct, unique place in the world for yourself, for your product, and for your company. Because the people who are different make the biggest difference. And so the great thing that people can do for me is to go into the world and make a different place for themself in a way that delivers massive value to others.

Lenny (01:48:00):
Beautiful. Chris, thank you again so much for being here.

Christopher Lochhead (01:48:04):
Lenny, bless you. I love all things, Lenny. Thank you.

# Relentless curiosity, radical accountability, and HubSpot’s winning growth formula | Chris Miller

## Transcript

Chris Miller (00:00:00):
... The actual really small initial growth team. We really had an aggressive mentality, an aggressive approach, and what that looked like was at the time, a very small percentage of, I think HubSpot's subscription revenue would be described as self-service, so we approached the team who owned it and we were like, "Are you all working on this?" They were like, "Nah, we're working on a bunch of other stuff." We were like, "Can we take this?" They were like, "Sure, if you want it." And so, we took it and immediately blew it up, and so that attitude of saying that every problem is our problem and radical accountability and ownership mentality helped us find opportunities that maybe the business wasn't explicitly asking us to solve, but we were able to triangulate why it might be important for the business for us to solve it. When you do that, we look hungry, so let's keep feeding us, right?

Lenny (00:00:48):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Chris Miller. Chris is VP of product for growth and AI at HubSpot. Chris started as an ICPM at HubSpot where he helped create their early growth team and as you'll hear, shifted HubSpot towards one of the most successful product-led growth businesses in history. Seven years later, he leads both their growth and AI teams and advises founders on product-like growth and growth strategy in general.

(00:01:20):
In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover what it takes to become a successful product leader in tech, what skills the most successful PMs need to build, how to find mentors, why you need to scrape your knees as an early PM. Also, a lot of great stories and insights about what HubSpot figured out about growth across content, sales product, market segments, and growth loops. I so enjoyed this conversation and we could have gone for another hour if I didn't cut myself off, and so I'm really excited for you to listen to this conversation. With that, I bring you Chris Miller after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted private supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback.

(00:03:31):
Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

Chris Miller (00:04:19):
I'm so excited to be on the podcast. Thank you, Lenny, for having me. This will be a lot of fun.

Lenny (00:04:24):
A huge thank you to Kyle Poyer for introducing us. I've heard so many great things about you from so many great people, and so I'm really excited to be chatting and I wanted to start with your very unique role that you're in now at HubSpot and it feels like it might be a sign of things to come for product leaders. Your title as far as I can tell is VP of product of growth and AI. Can you just talk about what that is and how growth and AI relate in the context of HubSpot?

Chris Miller (00:04:54):
I've been leading PLG at HubSpot for several years now, and I recently took on the AI leadership role. It's a special place to be in and that I get to help lead HubSpot in terms of how we should be thinking about building the foundational technology to create AI-powered experiences and then also lead the strategy of how we leverage those experiences to help that B2B business builder be way more successful using our platform than they might've been in years past. So, it's a really cool intersection point between those two things. There's a lot we can do there.

Lenny (00:05:33):
One thing I took away from what you just shared is that you are given these two teams to lead, which aren't necessarily connected, but I think it tells me that you're doing a great job at HubSpot and I'm going to try to pierce through your modesty and I'm curious, what is it that you think you've done really well or been successful at that got the leaders at HubSpot to decide to give you this other team that feels like an incredibly important initiative in this time of AI?

Chris Miller (00:05:58):
So when I joined HubSpot in 2016, it was definitely an element of timing that really worked in my favor. It was maybe like a year or so after HubSpot had launched their free CRM, which was a big strategic play for them and for us, excuse me, at the time, and it was meant to be disruptive, but I don't think that there was a fully formed perspective on what was going to happen after that. How are we actually going to get leverage and enterprise value out of this sort of big, enormous piece of free software we just put into the universe? And I think the pedigree of product manager at HubSpot at that time was also a bit different. There were folks who maybe started their time at HubSpot in support, and so intimately familiar with the product and with customers. Some of these people had closed thousands of support tickets and my background was a bit different.

(00:06:57):
I was actually less of a feature PM and I was sort of more of a growth PM in my DNA, and so I sort of looked at this through a completely different lens and I guess I understood that what we were trying to actually do was product-led growth, but we didn't really have the shared vocabulary to call it that. And so I think to answer your question, I think I was just willing to take some risks and really push for the things that I believed made sense even though maybe based on the titles that I had at the time, I wasn't sort of inherently given a seat at the table and really pushed my away into some of these conversations and then was eventually invited to them. And so, just always had an interest in driving a strategy that was a click or two higher than maybe what my immediate team was focused on and was always curious about how other parts of the business functioned.

(00:07:51):
I used to spend a lot of time sitting on the sales floor, just going into the other buildings and talking to other folks, working on different parts of the business, and that's part of maybe the serendipity that I miss about being in person, which is that you might just discover something from having a casual conversation with someone at the water cooler. You're like, "Oh, that's an interesting problem. I think my team can help with that," so you absorb a bunch of context around how pieces of the business are connected and you can start to really widen your aperture in terms of the size of opportunities that might be in front of you that maybe you would've missed if you would've been so heads down on execution work. And so, if I had to guess how people might talk about that, if I wasn't in the room, maybe they would cite that, but it's tough to say.

Lenny (00:08:34):
Hard to do those serendipitous watercolor chats in these remote hybrid times, huh?

Chris Miller (00:08:39):
Yeah, everything's so scheduled and tightly scheduled and you're bouncing from Zoom to Zoom and obviously HubSpot has embraced hybrid and there's a ton of benefit to it. In fact, I was a new dad when I came back to work and my son wasn't in daycare, and so it was so cool to just be able to pop out in between meetings and play with him for a few minutes just to go back and you don't get that when you're in the office all day. So definitely a lot of upside, but certainly you got to be a little bit more creative in terms of that serendipitous knowledge sharing, the osmosis learning, and just context sharing that happens more organically when everybody's sharing the same physical space.

Lenny (00:09:17):
You talked about how some of your early success was taking risks and being in meetings maybe you shouldn't be in. Is there an example or a story that comes to mind of doing that where you kind of took a risk early kind of in being a PM at HubSpot and/ or something that worked out really well, surprisingly?

Chris Miller (00:09:33):
This is a funny story. For anybody at HubSpot listening, I apologize in retrospect for this, but-

Lenny (00:09:40):
I'm excited for this.

Chris Miller (00:09:41):
There was a time where we were having a lot of debates around pricing and packaging, and we'll get into this, but our go-to-market model and sort of where we play in the addressable market created some complexity in the sense of we're serving different parts of the market simultaneously with the connected unified platform. And so, how do you think about packaging and go-to-market? And we were trying to just figure out how to simplify, simplify, simplify. And at the time I was an IC, individual contributing PM, so who am I to have a point of view on pricing and packaging? But the person I was working with, my designer, her name's Mariah Moscato, she's in product now, she's excellent, we were part of a triad and we both had a similar school of thought in terms of what the pricing packaging could be.

(00:10:33):
And we were over in Dublin where we have our European headquarters and there was a party happening at the Guinness sort of storehouse, and I don't know that we were exactly on the guest list, but we figured out a way to get into the party and we ran into the COO at the time and out of the blue I think he had asked us what we thought about pricing and packaging and it was sort of one of those funny you should ask moments. And so, we ended up kind of pitching in the midst of pints being sort of handed every which way you could turn this vision for a completely different way we might approach pricing and packaging, and he was pretty intrigued and he said, "Why don't you come to the next executive meeting and pitch us on it?"

(00:11:22):
I think that meeting was maybe a couple of weeks away and so we looked at each other and we were like, "Uh-oh," not exactly what we expected in terms of, I think people welcoming maybe a contrarian point of view at that moment in time. And so, we sort of were invited into this meeting with folks that we generally don't get to spend a lot of time with to pitch this thing that swam a little bit upstream and we ultimately didn't go full steam ahead down that path. I think a lot of elements of what we pitched have made their way over time into HubSpot's pricing and packaging, but it certainly I think opened the door for us and for me, speaking for myself, certainly for me to be welcomed back into that room in the future and to be able to contribute ideas towards important decisions.

Lenny (00:12:09):
I love that. It's another example of serendipity and just running into people. Also, I think it's a really good example of just how important it's for PMs to be proactive and think ahead and not just rely on people coming to you, asking you for your advice and getting invited to rooms. I feel like so much of success in the product leadership role is just suggesting great ideas, being ahead of where people are and having the answers. You have the answer right there in the moment because you did the work ahead of time. Is that something you find as well that ends up being really important?

Chris Miller (00:12:42):
Yeah, one of the traits that I look for in PMs that I hire onto my teams, and also when I think back to the people that I've learned a lot from working with over the years, one of the common behaviors or traits is relentless curiosity, this insatiable desire to understand things and a lack of fear in admitting when they don't understand things and being uncompromising and getting the answers so that they do understand. And I think if you can bring that to the table, it's much easier to have an outsized impact on whatever or you're a part of or whatever mission you're working on or whatever team you may be a member of.

Lenny (00:13:30):
Are there any other traits on that list of traits you look for that you think are really important that maybe other people don't focus on?

Chris Miller (00:13:37):
Yeah, relentless curiosity is probably my number one. My number two would probably be resilience, specifically if you're working in growth. I think if you're doing growth, right, if you're doing product-led growth the right way, then you're trying to balance the science and sort of taking a somewhat hygienic approach to validating assumptions and hypotheses with being really ambitious and really pushing for the things that are going to have massive impact for your customers at the end of the day. And when you're doing that, you're going to fail more than you're going to be successful along the way. And if you're not resilient, that can be really demotivating. I think there's a stat that some growth person put out there years ago, which is that on average only 20 to 30% of experiments of growth team runs might be successful. So, that means 70 to 80% of the time you're, you're not putting numbers on the board and you're extracting learnings hopefully that you can apply to the future.

(00:14:43):
But I think if you're not resilient, what I've seen happen is you end up sort of grasping for a win, which can sometimes look like making bets that are too small and too insignificant to matter. If your sort of primary modality of product-led growth work is experiment-driven product development and you're hitting more than like 30, 40% of the time, you're thinking too small. And so, that resiliency piece is certainly important in my mind. I think coachability is another one in the sense that I still think that the sort of subcategory of growth product management is still fledgling compared to PMs working on platform features. And so, even when I'm interviewing folks, I'm not necessarily looking for 10 years of experience doing PLG. I think that's mostly an unreasonable ask, but it can certainly be taught and even if you do have some experience doing PLG work, it's important to know that what that work is going to look like is going to potentially vary in a meaningful way from shop to shop.

(00:15:49):
And so, being coachable and adaptable to whatever the context is of the business or problem space that you're working on I think is an important trait that I look for in PMs, and then creativity is so important too. Valuing simple solutions to really hard problems, I think if building the next super sophisticated widget is the thing that gets you out of bed in the morning, growth might not be for you, I think the best growth product leaders and growth minds that I've worked with over the years or have had the privilege of learning from over the years, I think the thing that I noticed about them is they're almost ambivalent to the solution and certainly ambivalent to how complex a solution may or may not be. And taking little to no pleasure or pride in the complexity of a solution so long that it delivers the outcome that the business and your customers need, I think is a really cool trait, and I kind categorize that under creativity.

Lenny (00:16:53):
You mentioned this phrase, relentless curiosity, and it made me think about a story I read about you where the way you got into product management was you were at some startup and the founder was just like, "I've read that the cure to all our problems is going to be hiring product manager," and you heard that and you googled, what is product management, and then you asked them, "Can I do that?" And that's how you got into the role. So first of all, is that true? And second of all, what's your advice to people trying to get into product management and any lessons from that experience?

Chris Miller (00:17:22):
So first, yes, that is 100% true. That is how I stumbled into product management. So, I appreciate all the folks who took a shot on me back then, but this was at a time where I would say product management even as a function was definitely not ubiquitous across tech. There was, at least in the world that I was in, a lot more of a standard waterfall approach to building product with a lot of middle layers and engineering managers and really no one who had the job of owning the problem from a customer's point of view. And so, there wasn't a ton of content out there. There weren't even a ton of people in the city at the time that I could really talk to sort of learn, and so a lot of what I did was scrape my knees through the first years and a lot of painful trial and error.

(00:18:08):
And then eventually I think there's a lot more energy and an interest around the trade craft and the function, and so I think it's much easier today for someone to learn the fundamentals of product management without necessarily needing to do it via trial by fire. My advice to folks who are interested in breaking into product management specifically is focus on a few things. One, focus on structure. I think there's usually a lower barrier to entry to do product management at a smaller shop, which they might not have as much access to the best talent out there, but I think what you may often give up in those instances is structure to your own sort of professional development and formal training and education and potentially even the opportunity to work for people who are truly battle tested and have seen the movie several times and can actually wisdom share because truthfully, it looks different in every company, and so it is one of those functions.

(00:19:13):
I do believe that taking a truly academic approach towards upskilling has fairly diminishing returns because it's tough to field curveballs in a classroom. And so, choosing where you want to break in is almost as important as choosing that you want to break in the first place. Thinking about who you're going to be reporting to, thinking about what's the track record of success for people at that company, breaking into product management, trying to think five years in advance and work backwards, I think are all sort of important thought exercises along the way. I would also say that if you're already at a shop where you are working at a different function and you're sort of product curious, go talk to the PMs, literally I say go reach out to a PM and ask how you can make their day easier.

(00:20:01):
Figure out what you can do in your spare time that they can offload to you and do a little bit of volunteer labor, even if that's just shadowing because I think just getting that context and understanding the sort of rhythm of how a team ideates and defines problems and prioritizes and ship software is the experience that's going to be the most important because a lot of product management is also managing personalities and figuring out how people want to work with you and figuring out how you work for them. And so, just getting that hands-on experience or at least direct sight-line into the day-to-day of a team is really important because the extent to which you can understand their problem space and understand the things that keep them up at night, you can be valuable, and then at the very least, what you get out of it is hopefully an advocate or a sponsor at the end of the day who is willing to gamble some professional and political capital on you to get your foot into the door even though you might not have any formal experience on your resume.

Lenny (00:21:04):
There's so much stuff that super resonates there. One is that I always think of the bare minimum job of a PM is just to be useful to people on the team and help them do better work. If you do that alone, people-

Chris Miller (00:21:15):
Bring the donuts, right?

Lenny (00:21:16):
Bring the donuts, exactly.

Chris Miller (00:21:19):
I must be old, I don't know that anybody uses bringing the donuts now anymore.

Lenny (00:21:22):
No, we had Ken on the podcast, we talked about it. We asked, what is the digital version of that when everyone's working remote? I think that's something that even if you're a brand new PM you come across soon enough. And then the other piece there, I really love this metaphor of scraping your knees because I find that to be so important to becoming a PM is you think you could just read these things, take some courses and you got this, and you're not going to mess up, but I find that messing up is so important in helping to learn to do the job because like you said, there's relationships and people and changing plans and leaders, and it's just like you're not going to get it right and you learn how to deal with all these things by messing it up.

(00:22:01):
So, I super agree with that, and even though you said it's easier not to learn to be a PM, it's still I think important to scrape your knees a number of times for you to actually learn to do the job. Along those lines, what did you find was most helpful to you to learn the craft of product management in the first few years? What do you think back to like, "Oh, that was really helpful," other than just doing it messing up, sometimes getting it right?"

Chris Miller (00:22:27):
So, my first product management job/mission was working on a B2B2C product, and there's a lot of unique challenges that came with that. Our customer was not the end user of our product. We sold into institutions who then white labeled our product and then resold it to the end customer. And so at the end of the day, our customers own the relationship with the end user and not us, and so-

Chris Miller (00:23:00):
... own the relationship with the end user and not us. And so, the challenges that that created were that there was a lot of distance between us and the voice of the end user. And we ended up building a lot of things to satisfy the buyer and the customer, but not necessarily the end user. And that's challenging because you don't necessarily know whether you're building something to get a contract signed, or you're building something that's going to delight the person using it at the end of the day, or provide magical value. And so, I think I probably shipped a lot of bad product those years, if I'm being completely honest. I don't know that I would look back at what I shipped back then or what we shipped back then, and say they were the best possible solutions or best possible product.

(00:23:47):
It wasn't until I got my second product management job where it really was an inflection point, where I was like, "Oh, got it. This is what this is supposed to look and feel like."

Lenny (00:23:57):
Where was that? Was that with Keeper?

Chris Miller (00:23:59):
I was working at a fitness technology company, and the person who really I would say changed my entire paradigm of what product management is supposed to be, someone I know you know, Fareed Mosavat, who I believe was on the pod-

Lenny (00:24:17):
Ooh. Absolutely.

Chris Miller (00:24:17):
... last October. Shout out to Fareed if you're listening. Fareed is a good friend and mentor, and he really helped me level up. And what was interesting about those years is it was the first time I'd really gotten to work on a product where it was a freemium B2C run-tracking app. And so, we spent a lot of time talking to users directly, and a lot of guerrilla user research techniques. Literally, sometimes going outside and just talking to runners in passing to understand what were the challenges in finding motivation, and why do they choose running assistance, running applications in the first place? And so, just that having that deep connection to the customer and not feeling like you're being kept at arms' distance was eyeopening. I was like, "Oh, I didn't know that it could be like this."

(00:25:12):
And then, the second thing that we had at our disposal that changed the game for me was access to a huge user data set. And so, having data at scale to drive decisions, being able to know that if we make a change, we can prove causation from a business impact standpoint or a customer delight or engagement standpoint. And so, it was almost like I didn't realize I was blind until... Or you didn't realize you weren't seeing in color. It's like that scene in The Wizard of Oz where they land on Oz, and all of a sudden, everything's in Technicolor. And you're like, "Oh, my gosh, I can actually make informed decisions about what I'm shipping."

(00:25:56):
And having a level of rigor around that and really being forced to articulate a hypothesis and have a point of view on what the outcomes might be before you actually build something, were all sort of, I would say, behaviors and just philosophy around product discipline that I learned from Fareed and that group of folks that I worked with closely during those years. And that was, I think the... I consider that to be when I really became a product manager.

Lenny (00:26:30):
There's two things I want to highlight there that, again, super resonate. One is just whenever I talk to customers, I'm like, "Why don't I do this more often?" Because every time it's like, "Wow, I had no idea how big of a problem that was. Why don't I do this all the time?" And then, you don't again. And then, you do it months later and you're like, "Oh, my god, I learned so much again." And so, I think if you're listening and you're just like... Maybe just go talk to a customer today.

Chris Miller (00:26:55):
Talk to customers, and we also learned a lot from talking to people who we wanted to be customers but were not, right? And people who had either broken up with our product or evaluated it and never fell in love with it in the first place. And so, I think every PM struggles with time management and it feels like you need 60 hours in a day to get through your weekly checklist, or 60 hours in a week, excuse me. But finding time to just talk to people. Even today, I have a lot of friends who are entrepreneurs or small business owners, and some use HubSpot, some don't. But I usually tend to really enjoy my conversations with people who decided not to use HubSpot and to really try to unpack what drove that decision.

(00:27:40):
Was it as calculated, as I think sometimes we can all maybe assume that some of these decisions are? And then you often learn that they're sometimes kind of emotional, really instinctual and visceral and maybe connected to brands more than they even connected to product. And there's a lot of things that I think when you're in the proverbial digital conference room with your team, trying to understand what makes your users tick, you're just like, "We're actually just..." We're illogical humans at the end of the day at our core, and that all rides on decisions people make in the day-to-day. And it doesn't change, necessarily, when they're engaging with your product. As much as we love it to be perfect science, so that we can moneyball the system, if you will.

Lenny (00:28:23):
It reminds me of a story where we were doing some user research on a booking feature with an Airbnb. And we went to Paris to do these really in-depth user research studies. We were behind one-way mirrors and all that stuff. And we were trying to figure out why hosts weren't connecting Facebook to their account. This is like, I don't know, five, six years ago. Because it gave them so much access to where their friends are traveling and reviews and all these things. And especially, in France, they were just like, "I don't trust Facebook." And this was before it became a big thing in the US. They're just like, "I don't trust... I don't want them to have any of my data." "But look at all this power you get." They're like, "No, I don't care. I don't trust it." And-

Chris Miller (00:28:59):
Yeah, that's why talking to customers is so... You could have all the usage data in the world, that's going to tell you what's actually happening in your product, but it doesn't tell you why. It will never explain the why behind a behavior that you can track through events firing. And so, that's why that sort of proximity to the customer and directing that sort of relentless curiosity towards the qualitative stuff is so, so important because you just learn things that are just sometimes really unintuitive or are blind spots because we're often not the people we're building product for.

Lenny (00:29:35):
Absolutely. I want to shift talking about HubSpot the business, but one more last thing I wanted to highlight from what you just shared, which is a really good insight is you shared that your biggest inflection in your career was a manager, Fareed in this case, who helped you learn the craft and develop your skills, and that's the exact experience I had too. Just one specific manager changed everything for me. And that feels like a recurring theme to a lot of people, just having one person that really spends the time to help you learn and correct you when you're making mistakes and all that. So, if folks are wondering maybe why am I not learning enough or why is my care stagnating? See if you can just find... Easier said than done, but oftentimes it just takes one person to change everything.

Chris Miller (00:30:15):
It gets into sort of a conversation about the difference between a manager and a mentor, versus a sponsor and an advocate. Mentors are great, don't get me wrong. I have a ton of people that I would consider to be mentors, but when I think about the people in my life, who... The time that they donated to me, the time that they volunteered to me and for me, calling them mentors, I think sells what they were very short. And I would actually describe those folks as being sponsors and advocates, people who were willing to put up capital, whether that's professional, social capital to bet on you.

(00:30:56):
I mean, truth be told, when I interviewed with Fareed that first time, I think back to the interview and I think I bombed it. I actually don't think I would've hired me back then. And I remember the answers I gave to some of those questions, and I think they were good, but I don't think they were certainly great. And I imagine that there was something in there where the decision maker, who was Fareed said, "I think I can make something out of this." And I think being willing to invest in someone and finding people who are willing to invest in you is what really matters. And finding people who are willing to, again, put something up for you, whether that be whatever kind of capital it is. When I think about true gasoline on the career fire, it's finding mentors, but it's also finding sponsors and advocates.

Lenny (00:31:48):
Is there anything that you think you did right to help find mentors and sponsors and advocates for people that are thinking about, "Hey, I need this. How do I help myself in the same way?" Is there something you did that helped people get excited to help you?

Chris Miller (00:32:02):
Something I think I certainly continue to work on, but really, putting ego aside and embracing not knowing stuff and embracing not being good at stuff, and not feeling self-conscious about that and letting the desire to be the best at something or at least be great at something overpower the fear of being inadequate at something. And I played sports growing up, and so I like being coached. I can take hard feedback, and I like it because if I get better feedback than the people I'm competing against, I think I can beat them over time if I work hard enough.

(00:32:42):
And so, I think just taking that mentality with me into product management, I think has helped me build bridges with people who don't owe me anything, right? People who don't necessarily need to be invested in me at all, but who might get delight out of it somehow. And I don't know exactly how that works and the calculus that goes on in folks' brains, but at least what's within my control is how I can show up in the context of those relationships and really embrace even the hardest, ugliest feedback and hope that I can extract something from it that'll make me better at the end of the day.

Lenny (00:33:22):
I love that advice. Makes me think about Jules Walter's advice, which I've referenced many times on this podcast now, where his tip is when people are giving you feedback, just be like, "Thank you so much for that feedback," even though you're melting inside and just completely disagree with what they're telling you.

Chris Miller (00:33:40):
Yeah, shout out to Jules. Jules is also someone who has been generous with me in the past in terms of giving time when I've needed help with stuff. Also, a great episode you did with Jules.

Lenny (00:33:51):
So, many people have said what you just said about Jules, about how helpful he is been to them. So, clearly, a class act to that guy, maybe we'll have to bring him back.

Chris Miller (00:33:59):
Would love that.

Lenny (00:34:00):
Yeah. V2 Jules. So, let's shift to HubSpot the business, which is a pretty incredible success story. From what my notes, it's worth something like $30 billion now as a business. It's been around for 17 years. Still growing, I think, something like 30% year over year. And most interestingly, Okta put out this really interesting report recently where they looked at their data of what tools people are using to authenticate with, and they showed that basically HubSpot is maybe the fifth fastest-growing software product in the world. I don't know if it's true, but feels true because all the other companies make sense there. So, you don't have to confirm or deny this, but clearly things are going great at HubSpot. I'm curious just what makes HubSpot so special and unique and successful that's specifically unique to HubSpot versus other companies?

Chris Miller (00:34:51):
There's a lot in there. I can speak to the things that have resonated most deeply with me in my time there. The first is legitimate customer obsession. It's not marketing, it's legitimate, right? I've witnessed fierce and passionate debates internally that the root of what the people in the debate were really trying to unpack was what was the best thing for the customer. And so, really having that be central to our dogma and how we think about the business and why the company exists in the first place, really walking the walk there is something that I don't know that that's true everywhere.

(00:35:39):
I mean, I've certainly worked at places where that hasn't been true, and there's a lot of factors that can lead to those trade-off decisions at times. Like is this the right thing for the business, the right thing for the customer? Being really challenging. I think just sort of having that customer centricity really baked into the DNA of the company makes those decisions, maybe not easier, but at least you can have more conviction around the why behind the decision at the end of the day. Another thing that I think makes HubSpot-

Lenny (00:36:07):
Before you actually move on to the next one, I want to spend a little time on this one because I think people hear this and they're like, "Yes, okay, we're going to be customer obsessed." And then, you have to make these hard decisions. Look at this experiment, it's going to grow our revenue 1%, but it's not really going to make the customer's life easier. How do you actually make this real? And there may be an example where you have to trade off growth versus we need to make sure the customer is getting what they need or making the customer happy to make it a little more real even.

Chris Miller (00:36:34):
One, I think that's a really fantastic, maybe not counterpoint, but thing to call out. My point of view here is that oftentimes it's a function of what's the time horizon that the company uses as their sort of baseline for assessing decisions? And typically, when you're making decisions that could be described as hostile towards your customers, but a net positive for the business, you're probably not thinking long-term enough, right? Because there's no possible way, unless you have completely cornered a market and there is no competition whatsoever, that you could continually be hostile towards your customers and grow, right? At some point, that's going to catch up.

(00:37:25):
And so, oftentimes I think it's the tension of what do we need to do in the short term to survive? Versus long-term, where are we going? What's the path that we're actually charting? Is I think the true tension. But if you're making decisions that might have lasting impact that are customer hostile, I think that's a really dangerous path to kind of go down. And so, having, I think, the discipline or the bravery or the courage, whatever, to I think focus on not necessarily tomorrow or the day after, and really think about two, three, four years from now, what are the outcomes we're trying to drive and what are the decisions we need to make in the interim that are going to lead to that outcome? If you stick to that sort of framework, or first principle is a better way to describe it, then I think you'll often end up arriving at the conclusion that doing the thing that's right for customers at the end of the day is the right decision.

Lenny (00:38:24):
Is there something in the way you operate that helps you systemize that in your experiment plan or product specs or experiment results? Or is there a story of something where you just shipped something that shows this customer obsession to make it even more concrete for listeners?

Chris Miller (00:38:42):
There's definitely structure you could put around customer centricity. And I think a lot of it for growth at HubSpot and the teams that I lead, it's around forcing specificity of language. So, for example, you look at a lot of standard documentation for features or experiments, whatever, and one of the first things, it's like outline the problem. I don't know that we even talk about problems without a qualifier. Are we talking about a business problem? Are we talking about a customer problem? Are we talking about an efficiency problem? Describe the nature of the problem and parse it out. Because generally speaking, if there's a business problem, you might do the thought exercise of asking, "Well, why hasn't that problem solved itself? What's the actual customer problem that is leading to the downstream negative thing that's happening to the business?"

(00:39:34):
And if we can actually create some daylight between those two things conceptually, we can avoid making the mistake of trying to solve a business problem in a way that leads to a bad outcome for the customer at the end of the day. And I think, also, creating a system that makes it easy for PMs to call out assumptions that they might be making. So, if we do this, what would you predict to be some of the sort of derivative downstream things? And if we can call those things out and just keep asking why, why, why, to sort of justify some of the direction you want to go in and then keep asking in what, what, what, in terms of what's the sort of true blast radius and domino effect of these decisions is the approach that we take at HubSpot, in my teams at least.

Lenny (00:40:23):
Awesome. Okay. So, I cut you off in this one bullet point so far. So, let's keep going.

Chris Miller (00:40:29):
Yeah. So we're talking about the things that make HubSpot special. So, customer obsession is definitely one. I think where we play in the market, too. Being a company that has been comfortable staying in the mid-market, SMB mid-market space, and resisting the temptation to try to crawl up into enterprise software, I think makes us special. And one of the things that's actually really straightforward, which is that a lot of enterprise software companies, a lot of your revenue is tied up in a small subset of customers. And I think what can happen there is if those customers decide that they want you to build something and they're willing to threaten their business over it, then you'll end up building it. And is that necessarily the thing that is going to serve all your customers best? Probably not. Are you going to end up having to build and maintain bespoke software for one customer? Probably.

(00:41:21):
And don't get me wrong, I think there's a lot of product folks out there who enjoy that modality of work, I'm not one of them. And so, by playing in the mid-market, it means our revenue is distributed more evenly across our entire install base, which means that there's no single customer who can hold us hostage, really. But what that does is with great power comes great responsibility. I think what that does is the forcing function of ensuring that the decisions that we make are a net benefit for the largest swath of customers possible. And I think it really is the guiding light behind some of our decisions around connected experience and usability and user experience. And so, playing in the mid-market, I think affords us to be able to do that. So, I think that's another thing that makes us special for a company of our size.

(00:42:10):
Culture is another one. And I won't get into the culture code. I think a lot of folks have probably read it. If not, go check it out.

Lenny (00:42:18):
I don't know if people have heard of that. What is that?

Chris Miller (00:42:20):
Yeah. Dharmesh, our co-founder, one of our fearless leaders, Dharmesh, one of the things he most famously did early on is he published the HubSpot culture code externally. You can Google it and find it anywhere. I think a lot of companies sort of replicated that over the years, but by being really open and transparent about the culture both internally and externally, I think one, it internally creates alignment and it gives everyone something to point to to enforce why did we choose to work with each other the way that we work with each other. I think it also helps in attracting the right type of candidates because we put it out there, we're sort of really open about it. If you don't like that culture, chances are you probably won't be super excited to work here. But if that's something that you're craving, and I think a lot of quality people crave a lot of the things that are sort of codified in our culture. Humility, empathy, adaptability, remarkability, transparency are sort of all things that I think people take quite seriously.

(00:43:19):
And so, being really open and honest about that. And being willing to sort of pressure test it on a regular basis, like is this still a company we want to be? We are growing really fast. What has changed? What conditions are still able to be supported with the culture we have codified today? What amendments might we need to make in terms of who we want to represent ourselves to be to our customers and how do we want to work with each other? And investing in that, hiring really good people that can help us scale that I think is something that makes HubSpot really special.

Lenny (00:43:52):
Amazing. I'm reading the culture code on the side here, and there's these little quotes that are really sweet. I really like this one, "Solve for the customer, not just their happiness, but also their success."

Chris Miller (00:44:04):
Yes.

Lenny (00:44:05):
Wise.

(00:45:10):
Is there anything really fun about the culture, like a fun thing that you all do that's a quirky HubSpot ritual?

Chris Miller (00:45:17):
Yeah, there's a ton, but I think there's definitely a very legitimate school of thought around how culture can both contribute to inclusion, but also, be a headwind to inclusion. I think a lot of the things that I might associate with HubSpot culture are very much rooted in a specific period of HubSpot, right? It was probably a pre-pandemic period. It was probably a period where we were all working in the same physical space. And so, there's a lot of inside jokes. And sometimes the things are rooted in very specific quirks of specific individuals who may not even be at the company anymore. And so, if you're someone who's joined the company in the past two or three years and that flies over your head-

Chris Miller (00:46:00):
The company in the past two or three years, and that flies over your head. I think we have to ask ourselves, "What's the value of continuing to embrace these things?" And so I think what we've been doing over the years is taking inventory of the things that might have been considered part of HubSpot legacy culture and really trying to again, pressure test it. Does this continue to serve us today? And if not, we should be really comfortable of letting it go.

(00:46:24):
But one of the things that I think is super dope that we do is we do this thing called PEER Week, which was something that popped up during the pandemic and the TLDR is that it's like an event for product and engineering; where travel changed with the pandemic and people don't get to see each other in person as much, but there's a couple of weeks in the summer in June where we fly everybody in either if you're in North America, we fly you to Cambridge. If you were in Europe somewhere, then we fly you to Dublin and we spend a week together.

(00:46:56):
There's not a ton of focus on just classic productivity. There's a ton of focus on building connections and safety and just getting to know people and who they are as human beings, but also, damn I forgot how much I missed whiteboarding. It's actually being able to get in a room with a physical whiteboard of people and work on some stuff. And so this is, I think the second year in a row, or second or third I don't remember, pandemic years have really fogged the brain... That we've done it. And it's one of the things I look most forward to every year is getting everybody in the same city to just hang out.

Lenny (00:47:27):
I love it. I keep peeking at these highlights and they're really interesting. So we're going to link to this culture code also in the show notes if you want to check it out. But anyway, let's focus on how HubSpot grows. And there's kind of two parts, in my mind there's just like, how did it start and what worked really well. You're actually on the inaugural team, I believe, of HubSpot's growth team and things worked out. Well done. I'm curious maybe just to start what you think you did so right, early on in the history of HubSpot to help it grow into the behemoth it has become. What was kind of the early success elements that were key?

Chris Miller (00:48:03):
I would say the early years of doing freemium. And for the record, there's definitely an iteration of the growth team before I joined that, you know really like Brian Balfour was the person who I would say injected that first dose of PLG DNA into HubSpot. So shout out to Brian. I want to make sure he gets the credit that he's owed.

Lenny (00:48:26):
Yeah, we're going to have him on the podcast at some point. It's in the works.

Chris Miller (00:48:29):
Yeah, he's a legend. Brian's great.

Lenny (00:48:30):
Absolute legend.

Chris Miller (00:48:31):
And so after Brian had left HubSpot, it was a bit start and stop. And so when I joined and we sort of took another stab at it, I think there were a few things we did. One, in the beginning is we really had an aggressive mentality, an aggressive approach I think. And by we, I mean the team, the actual really small initial growth team. We tried not to be pedantic about where we were spending our time. And so we sort of tossed our mission and charter out of the window. We said, cool, maybe on paper we were, I think the sales tool, activation team. It was a very boutique mission and remit compared to I think a lot of the other teams at HubSpot's missions and remit at the time.

(00:49:21):
But even though that's what we were supposed to be working on paper, we were sort of like, if we find something that looks like an opportunity and no one else in the business is thinking about it, we're just going to try to fix it. We're going to ask for forgiveness rather than permission and start to call some plays.

(00:49:38):
And what that looked like was at the time, a very small percentage of, I think HubSpot's subscription revenue would be described as self-service, like people putting in their credit card and buying something. It was predominantly product driven leads like PQLs. And so we were literally sending everything to the sales team, which it was running revenue, but certainly opportunities for efficiency because it was the first time we'd really had a product at a price point that could be transactional and not a highly considered purchase. And so we were thinking about this and we were like, "Well, how does this work? Is there even a pricing page in the product that people could actually buy something?"And we found it, but it had been neglected. It was sort of like, I think no one was sort of committing any code to that repository.

(00:50:31):
So we approached a team who owned it and we were like, "Are y'all working on this? Is this an active development?" And they were like, "Nah, we're working on a bunch of other stuff." We were like, "Can we take this?" And they were like, "Sure, if you want it, take it. It's one less code base for us to maintain." And so we took it and immediately blew it up. We redesigned the whole thing focused on discoverability, how are people getting to this page, focusing on desirability, like how are we talking about the value props of the things that we're wanting to sell to customers to help them grow better. And then thinking about doability or usability, how do we actually just remove the friction that's standing in the way?

(00:51:10):
And so we did a mad dash towards this outcome we wanted to drive, and when we released it worked. It was actually a step function change in the way that the physics of the business and the funnel really looked. And I think that was probably a catalyst moment of everyone saying, "Oh wow, there might actually be something here." And so that attitude of saying that every problem is our problem and being willing to really take a mentality of like, I think radical accountability and ownership mentality helped us find opportunities that maybe the business wasn't explicitly asking us to solve, but we were able to triangulate why it might be important for the business for us to solve it.

(00:51:54):
And when you do that, I think the business, a business may get more comfortable putting more on your plate. Right? And so it's like we look hungry, so let's keep feeding us. And so over time our remit expands and there's other things that we think are opportunities to gain leverage for the business or deliver a delight to our customers in a more efficient way, and honestly in a way that they probably expected to engage with us at that point in time. It was quite odd that there were so many humans involved in every stage of the customer journey and some of our customers just like, "I just want to be able to try the thing and buy it if I want to be. I really don't want to be forced into a sales engagement." And so it was really kind of meeting the expectations of the modern software buyer in many ways.

Lenny (00:52:41):
It sounds incredibly important. Basically your team turned HubSpot into a very product led growth business, which feels very important in the history of HubSpot's growth. Would you consider what was there before where it was the beginnings of self-service, but they had to talk to a salesperson? Would you consider that product led?

Chris Miller (00:52:59):
Yes.

Lenny (00:53:00):
Okay.

Chris Miller (00:53:00):
Yes.

Lenny (00:53:00):
And so how would you describe what the shift was in terms of the way the sales motion and growth motion changed?

Chris Miller (00:53:07):
The go-to-market motions that we were working on definitely fit under, I think the broad umbrella of PLG, but I don't think the culture of the company was necessarily explicit about being a PLG company. I don't think that's the way we talked about who HubSpot was and trust me, there were a bunch of other factors in here. I definitely, I won't say that our team were the sole driving force behind that shift in our strategy and approach, but certainly the data that we were able to collect and the experiments we were able to run and the insights we were able to surface and the research we were able to synthesize... It gave us conviction to double down on it for sure. And that was definitely maybe the beginning of that inflection point for the company, but there was certainly a lot of other things that led to us wanting to become more product led.

(00:54:01):
Again, I think about it, I think any company is probably searching for ways to operate more efficiently. And if your revenue is so tied to go-to-market headcount, it gets really hard to scale the bigger you get. And so I think there's an innate desire to want to be more non-linear in our growth. And I think us arriving at the right place at the right time created sort of alignment around what the path forward could look like. If we want to live in that world, how might we get there? And I think that's where we really fit into the equation. It's like, "Oh, we invest in this team. If we invest in the type of work this team is doing, that's how we're going to build efficiencies over time." And it's also, we like that because it's in line with what our customers are already expecting from us.

Lenny (00:54:47):
And it sounds like you weren't like, "We need to be more product led." It was more just how do we get the sales process more efficient and the motion of growth more efficient and that emerged out of that.

Chris Miller (00:54:58):
Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong. We were definitely like, we need to be more product led. And I think that's actually the nuance here. You asked would I consider what we were doing product led growth? And I think the answer is absolutely, but that's because a fallacy that people, a lot of, I think maybe early stage founders or folks who are unfamiliar with chronic growth or maybe only know about it from an academic point of view, maybe fall into the trap of is assuming that in order to be a PLG company you can use that interchangeably with being a fully self-service business or fully self-service go-to market.

(00:55:34):
I don't actually think that those things are one and the same. I think that most companies, at least the larger, more successful ones that have done amazing things and are cornering their market or category, that we would consider to be PLG companies have a bunch of humans working on really important things on their go to market, and it's more of a hybrid motion. And I think it's less about, again, being sort of myopic about your approach to PLG and having it being really rooted in principles that are, I think very kind of academic or conceptual in nature.

(00:56:08):
But more sort of being pragmatic and saying, "Okay, cool. Who is our customer? What is the product that we sell? How are our customers used to buying this thing? How would they prefer to buy it in the future that they would like to live in? What's the packaging of our products? How do our customers decide? Is it a top down decision or a bottoms up decision? How complex are our building and subscription terms is something that's going to be pretty transactional or something that's going to be fairly considered? How comfortable is our target market with the technology in our category? Are we competing against non-consumption? Are we competing against competitors in the same category?"

(00:56:48):
And if you actually answer those questions, and I think it may be obvious where I'm going with this, but based on the answer to those questions, the conditions on the ground might lend themselves to be more favorable to product-led growth and be more favorable to self-service, right? It's why there are companies that the value prop is just so... Like you don't need a person to sell you Loom. I use Loom and it's so intuitive that I can just decide on my own whether I want to buy it. You don't need a person to teach you how to use even Slack to some example. Like Slack is extremely intuitive. Right? Like you could throw someone in Slack and use a product in a similar paradigm and it can probably figure out the basics on their own.

(00:57:25):
There are certain products that don't necessarily check those boxes. And so I think what you can do is kind of take a more modular approach to PLG, and it's like based on how a customer in the best case scenario might go from zero to one when it comes to activation and onboarding, do we need to have a human involved in that process at all? Or as a backstop? If the answer is yes, then maybe figure out ways to have humans involved where your cost structure is durable or at least defensible. If that's not the case, then go take a PLG approach to it.

(00:57:59):
And so across our entire business, we've never taken a very pure, everything here for this line of business or this product line is going to be self-service without being able to defend and contextualize why across the entire customer journey this makes sense. And so yeah, we have customers who come in through the product led front door and kick the tires on the product on their own and activate on the product on their own. But then when it comes time to buy the product, they want to talk to somebody and there's legitimate reasons why, right? There are maybe IT and security concerns that they need to get somebody on the phone for. Maybe they're coming for a platform where data migration is a huge fear they have, and that's not something that's easy to do in a self-service environment yet. I think that's going to change over time. But today it's still kind of painful when you're doing rip and replaces.

(00:58:48):
And so to try to brute force that into a sort of self-service motion for every customer writ large would be solving for your business' desires, not necessarily solving for the customer at the end of the day. But we also sell into different segments of customers that are maybe digital natives but not familiar with products in our category. And maybe they're coming from not a competing product, but they're coming from a more rudimentary system like spreadsheets. I mean, I've seen customers using post-it notes to manage their.

Lenny (00:59:25):
[inaudible 00:59:25].

Chris Miller (00:59:25):
The deal pipeline, the real old school way, and that was sort of their locus of control for their sales team. Right?

(00:59:31):
And so there are use cases like that if you're a smaller team, you kind of have an acute understanding of the pain points that are like today's buyers that you need to put out. You don't have to deal with the burden of a huge data migration. And the person who's going to be in the CRM day in and day out is also the person who gets to make the final call on what CRM they're going to use. There's a ton of those customers that we never talk to in person, right? And that's awesome too. And so being comfortable with things not necessarily fitting into clean boxes and having conviction that a modular approach or a more hybrid approach is actually the way to optimize for the customer and the business at the end of the day is something that I think we embraced really early on.

(01:00:17):
One of the first metrics that I had was activation rate, but it was also how much demand am I sending to the sales team? And there was no turf war about that, right? It's like, oh, that's net positive for if people are able to get helped and a lot of the questions that they have cannot be answered with the product today, we should absolutely be proud to connect them with one of our awesome people in sales who can be like, help see if the solutions we offer are a good fit for them. And there are instances where people just don't want to talk to somebody, and our job is to make sure that there's a friction-free way for them to make that decision on their own.

Lenny (01:00:48):
Amazing. I think on the one hand, this could be a whole podcast is just talking about your PLG learnings, knowing... It feels like HubSpot is one of the biggest success stories of transitioning more and more into PLG, at least at that point. Even though you're saying it was PLG early on, it feels like a huge shift to the business. So I really like this framework you just shared of if you're trying to become more product led, just think about the zero to one from visit to activation and when does someone really have to talk to someone and how do we help them not have to talk to people in that moment? So either in that direction or just broadly, if someone was trying to explore how do we become more product led, what are the first couple steps and dives you would recommend they do to help them down that road?

Chris Miller (01:01:34):
First I would ask, why do you want to be product led? What assumptions are you making in terms of why being product led are going to be net positive for the business or for your customers? And I might even ask them to define what product-led means to them that we can get on the same page of what we're even talking about.

Lenny (01:01:52):
How would you define it? Do you have a rough, an answer to that? Just so people get a sense of what it probably means.

Chris Miller (01:01:58):
Yeah. At the highest level, it's like taking a go-to-market approach where your product job is to grow revenue and you use humans as a backstop and not the other way around.

Lenny (01:02:08):
Awesome.

Chris Miller (01:02:09):
And I think the key thing is that humans can be a backstop. There are moments where it's going to make sense for humans to be a backstop. One example that is I think is really normal, a hardship circumstance where a customer needs to end their relationship, right? Like every SaaS company deals with this. Some take a fully automated approach, but most usually have some sort of escalation path that will result in a human having to resolve this. It doesn't make them any less product led. I think every company at its core is having some humans behind the scenes interface with customers on things related to go-to-market. But I think once defining that and getting on the same page about that, I think you can learn a lot. And by the way, these are the normal conversations that I have with founders all the time. I'm actually an operator in residence at OpenView, and so I speak to a lot of their poor [inaudible 01:03:01], and this is usually the conversation that we end up having.

(01:03:03):
And I think what's always interesting is how different the sort of array of answers are when you ask that question. Some are like, oh, it's about top of the funnel demand. We want to be more product led because we want more leads, we want more signups. You're like, "Oh, okay." And that's a very defensible reason. There's a lot of data that shows that freemium products attract a lot more top of the funnel demand than sales led go-to-market products do. Right? Some, it might be a matter of constrained resources. We absolutely need to be more product led in the stage of the company because we simply cannot hire an army of implementation specialists and folks on the customer success outside of the house to help every single customer at scale, which is generally a byproduct of having a really large top of the funnel. And then there are others that are, it's about revenue efficiency.

(01:03:56):
And so when you can kind of articulate the outcomes that you want to drive, it helps triangulate where to begin. So if you are really focused on top of the funnel demand, trying to do self-service checkout is a silly place to start. And so just really doing the fun exercise of articulating why do you care about this? Why are you actually interested in this in the first place? If you do this, what would change about your business? What assumptions are you making? And when you can actually list those things out, you can map them to parts of the customer journey where there may be opportunity to be more product led if the company isn't there yet.

Lenny (01:04:34):
Awesome. Maybe a couple more questions along these lines and then I just have a couple more questions I definitely want to ask. When someone is trying to go in the direction of product led growth, A.K.A. more self-service, and I guess maybe let me just ask, is that sort of how you think about the equivalency of those two?

Chris Miller (01:04:50):
Sure.

Lenny (01:04:50):
Okay. What are maybe the most common mistakes they make that aren't as obvious?

Chris Miller (01:04:55):
I mean, the number one mistake is hiring a head of growth, giving them no resources and expecting them to pull rabbit out of their hat.

(01:05:04):
I feel like every PLG veteran has some joke that they tell about the poor head of growth who has no tooling, no engineering cycles, no designer, no access to data, and then are handed a really scary big number and told to go move it. I think that's a common mistake that has stood the test of time.

(01:05:28):
Another one is expecting really quick turnaround and thinking of it the same way you might think about hiring a sales, an incremental sales headcount, which is that you're expecting near term liquidity from that investment, but when you're doing PLG at its core, it's still R&D. You're still sort of planting seeds with the hope that over time this is going to play out in the form of durable pie efficient growth. But if you're expecting, you put a team on something and then you want that team to sort of have outsize impact, and sure there's going to be low hanging fruit, but I think just not having the patience to see the investment through and cutting bait too early is another, I think mistake some companies make.

(01:06:20):
And then I also think that bad data hygiene is the other one. So not having taken a beat to properly instrument their product, messy data, no real self-service way for people to access that data. Like having analyst bottlenecks can be a terrible position to be in. And so eating your veggies, getting your house in order from a data standpoint, I think is a crucial first step because if you can't actually measure what's happening, then like why?

(01:06:54):
And then maybe the last one is people giving up because they don't have enough data, right? They're like, we can't do PLG because we don't have this massive data set the way that HubSpot has or the way the Airbnb has. And it's like you can still do PLG, you just need to use different data. The way we think about data is that quant data is just another form of data. The same way experiment results are just another data point. You can learn a ton from just talking to customers. Like qual research is super-duper important, and so if you don't have data to tell you exactly what every single person is doing in your product in aggregate, you can still talk to 10 customers and probably get a clear sense of what's happening and why it's happening. That you wouldn't even get from the quant data.

(01:07:33):
So people getting demotivated or companies getting demotivated because they think they're too early to do PLG, you can still do PLG. PLG at its core is just having your product sell the value prop of what your business does, and you can still deliver on that without being able to stand up a very robust and sophisticated experimentation practice.

Lenny (01:07:53):
Kind of along those lines, but going even broader. Without disclosing trade secrets of how HubSpot works, how would you describe the loop of growth of HubSpot? In the words of, you mentioned Brian Belfor and Fareed, what is the growth loop of HubSpot either now or recently? Just a simple way to think about how HubSpot grows.

Chris Miller (01:08:12):
Our loops are less tactical. In fact, if I'm being brutally honest, I think loops are kind of hard to achieve in B2B SaaS. I think there's some examples of that, but I think some of the best loops come from UGC, user generated content. I think a lot of B2C community focused platforms can do loops really well. I think if it's B2B SaaS, it's hard to find things that get loopy. And it is me going, I think all my Reforge [inaudible 01:08:40] are going to be upset that I said that. But I think that's the truth.

(01:08:42):
When I think about the flywheel of HubSpot, I think it's more of a macro flywheel. And just to kind of lean into our own lingo, it's really attracting gage and delight. And so, one of the principles that guides our thinking and our strategy is give value before you extract value. And I think that was at the core...

Chris Miller (01:09:00):
Give value before you extract value, and I think that was at the core of inbound marketing at its inception, that outbound marketing was asking for something from customers or prospects before giving anything. And so at its core it's like, okay, yeah, if you give a little for free, people who are interested in sort of hearing the rest of how that album sounds are going to come and stick around for more. And so in our pre PLG days, it was content marketing and white papers and listicles and eBooks and things that people had to download that were really filling the top of the funnel. And that is just taking another form with PLG.

(01:09:39):
And so we intentionally put out a lot of free software. And the idea is that this software is not sort of gimmicky. It's not designed to run out of value on day one. It's actually designed so that our smallest customers can get some value out of it in a sustainable way. But if they're engaging with it deeply enough, they're going to run into the limits of what that value is. And if we've done our jobs and delivered what we believe we were supposed to deliver, then the decision to purchase becomes a no-brainer.

(01:10:10):
And if they're delighted with the experience of being a customer, they're going to become advocates, and they're going to become promoters, and they're going to tell their peers. Because what we also know is that a lot of small business owners and even medium-sized business owners take a lot of guidance from their community of peers. And sometimes that's a digital community, sometimes that's not. And so anytime we win an advocate through delivering an excellent customer experience, they bring more people into the top of the funnel. And so it's a really honest, and I would say an honest macro loop in the sense, but that's the way we think about our flywheel.

Lenny (01:10:50):
Oh man, this could be a whole other hour of a podcast just diving into this stuff. This is so good. You shared this interesting story that I wasn't aware of. So HubSpot's kind of known for content and SEO. You search for anything and there's always a HubSpot article about it. And so is what you're sharing here, essentially that was a big part of the early days, SEO, free content that drove people to the site and the product wasn't free, is what I'm hearing. And then it shifted to now it's a free product that anyone can use and that's what drives the top of funnel.

Chris Miller (01:11:21):
Yes, correct.

Lenny (01:11:22):
Amazing.

Chris Miller (01:11:23):
I can't give a specific number, but a large percentage of our revenue flows through the product. And it's not necessarily maybe where people ultimately purchased, but that's their sort of first conversion event with us. They were in the product, they liked what they saw, they spoke to somebody, and then eventually became a customer. And that is now a pretty robust top of the funnel for the company.

Lenny (01:11:45):
So I think this is a really interesting story of just starting with one growth channel of SEO essentially, content marketing and then shifting to something else. Is there any lessons from that experience for people trying to kickstart their growth of SEO versus this freemium approach? Is there anything there that just like this worked really well for us and you should probably try this, or SEO kind of runs out in this specific type of business?

Chris Miller (01:12:10):
I'll admit I'm definitely not an SEO expert. I've been fortunate to work with some of the best marketers in the world who I think are bonafide legends at this point in terms of what they've been able to achieve at HubSpot and building that lead and signup machine.

(01:12:24):
What I will say is being really aggressive about experimenting with new channels is so important, and diversifying your channel mix is so important because things can change overnight and that might disrupt your entire funnel. Like a Google algorithm change can have a massive impact. If you're reliant on app store optimization, a change in Apple's algorithm might have a massive impact. What we're seeing with generative AI, I think there's a lot of people losing sleep at night because it's unclear how this is going to impact SEO writ large. If that's what fuels your entire business is being on Google search result page, then what's going to happen in this new sort of world we're about to enter?

(01:13:15):
And so I think to the extent that you can not have your funnel be relying on a single or a couple of channels is really important. We're always testing new channels. One of the channels that we're spending some time experimenting with is this concept of microapps. And it's actually not a new concept for HubSpot. One of the first microapps you ever built was a... Maybe Dharmesh built this, the original one, but it was called Website Grader. And it was you put in your domain, and it crawled your site, and then gave you a set of recommendations for how you would optimize your site. And it was free. It was definitely a one trick pony. But what it did was it created an interesting conversation, which is like, okay, cool, now that you have this information, what are you going to do about it? And one of the things you could do is you could become a HubSpot customer and you can use our product to fix a lot of this stuff.

(01:14:06):
And that worked for us. It worked really, really well. And so we've done that play a few times and it's something that we'll probably continue to do. We have a bunch of these microapps. We have a brand kit generator, we have an email signature generator. We've experimented with a Build My Persona generator. There's a couple of ones that I can't talk about right now, but we'll learn a little bit about in a few weeks at Inbound. But yeah, microapps are an exciting new channel for us. And some will be successes, some will flop, and we'll probably sunset them. But being willing to fail in the pursuit of finding new distribution channels is also really important.

Lenny (01:14:44):
That's an awesome insight. Is there a place people can go to find these microapps that you all have built?

Chris Miller (01:14:49):
There will be soon.

Lenny (01:14:50):
Oh, mysterious. I also noticed Dharmesh tweeting about some AI projects he's working on. Is that related to these microapps? Or is that just him on his own time just doing fun stuff?

Chris Miller (01:15:00):
Very related to microapps. I would say ChatSpot is actually, and for those who don't know what ChatSpot is, ChatSpot is a bit of an AI copilot that Dharmesh built that has sort of been very positively received by both HubSpot customers and non-HubSpot customers alike. And so that's something that we're, wearing my AI hat, spending a lot of time thinking about, sort of what direction do we want to go in the ChatSpot.

(01:15:26):
But again, it was something that we put out in the universe to see what happens. And now it's like, oh, we're getting an interesting amount of signups every month. Who would've guessed that? I don't think that... That definitely wasn't on the roadmap a year ago. And I think being a 17-year-old SaaS company that can still operate with that sense of urgency and pace helps a lot to why wait to get consensus on a decision when we can put something out there and then see what happens and see what the data says.

Lenny (01:15:58):
Yeah, I was just going to say that it feels like it's such a win-win-win, including it's just a release for people on the team that have been there for a long time just to work on something totally different and new and just launch a new product.

Chris Miller (01:16:08):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny (01:16:10):
I love that. Is there anything that just significantly accelerated growth in the last, I don't know, number of years that was like, wow, this really changed the game.

Chris Miller (01:16:18):
Covid. Covid was obviously challenging and awful on so many levels, but it was scary. It was super scary. We were all terrified. We didn't know what it meant for our jobs. My own sister, who also works at HubSpot now, she at the time was transitioning into hospitality and was two months into her job when she got furloughed because of Covid. So who knew what the world was going to look like and how it was going to impact businesses?

(01:16:45):
I think we were prepared for the worst, and we actually caught a bit of the Covid tailwind and a lot of other businesses did, because companies who never had to think about digital marketing all of a sudden had to, and it was urgent. It was a burning need for them to figure out how they were going to weather the storm. And I think one of the things that HubSpot did, and this is one of the sort of phrases we use internally, is never waste a good crisis.

(01:17:14):
And so, one of the things we leaned into was sort of goodwill pricing, and we lowered the price on some of our tools and created some temporary leniency around certain things. And just the removal of that friction ended up being a really interesting tailwind for the business and specifically for the business that I run, which is our starter business, our free and starter business, we really accelerated growth during that period, which was not... I think if you would've looked at my Bingo card in March of 2020, I don't know that I had that on the Bingo card.

Lenny (01:17:50):
I'm looking at the stock price in another window here and I could see what happened. That went great, and even it came down with the whole market, but it's coming right back up. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Chris Miller (01:18:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:18:06):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Chris Miller (01:18:10):
Truthfully, I don't read a ton of books. Got a one and a half year old. I also probably didn't read a ton of books before, but it's a nice excuse to have. That's why I don't have time to read today. But when I think of books that I think about a lot still, there's a book called Everybody Lies, and it's a book... I believe the guy who wrote it was a data scientist at Google. And part of the message is that everybody's a data scientist and really trying to democratize the idea of using data in your everyday lives to make decisions and demystifying the idea of data science. But the way he kind of does this is through comparing Google search data and what we know people to be actively looking for answers for, with sort of qualitative survey data. And people lie on surveys all the time for a variety of different reasons, but no one lies to Google because it's transactional. If I lie to Google, I'm not going to get what I want. And so it kind of really explores what it means to tell the truth and how honest we are with ourselves and with the internet. And so I really love that book.

(01:19:15):
The other book I really love is Chop Wood Carry Water, which it's like a parable about a young boy who wants to become a samurai. But the sort of message of the book is about falling in love with the process, especially the most mundane parts of a process of becoming great at something. And that's something I... It's a good reminder about patience, humility, and sort of taking things one step at a time. And I often reference Chop Wood Carry Water a lot.

Lenny (01:19:47):
Reminds me of The Score Takes Care of Itself, I think is the name of the book.

Chris Miller (01:19:51):
Yeah, yeah, I've heard of it.

Lenny (01:19:53):
Bill Walsh. Amazing. Okay. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Chris Miller (01:19:57):
Oh, man. On Amazon Prime, I'm a Virgo, and it's a Boots Riley show. Boots Riley directed Sorry to Bother You. It just blew my mind. It's super surreal and funny and dark and it stars Jharrel Jerome, who I think he played one of the characters in the Netflix Central Park Five. I think he won a couple of awards for that too. And that was a show I watched recently where I had no expectations going into it other than I knew it was a Boots Riley show and was just enthralled. It touches on... It is a really cheeky way of touching on a lot of really important topics, but often hard to talk about topics and themes, and it's kind of delightful to get through it. So, I'm a Virgo. I just binged Barry from season one through four. Henry Winkler was spectacular. And then just came off of Succession, too. The theme here is I really dark comedies. Yeah, really, really dark comedies are kind of my thing.

Lenny (01:21:00):
And that first one was called I Am a Virgo, because I thought you were just saying you're a Virgo.

Chris Miller (01:21:04):
No, no. The name of the show is called I'm a Virgo. Yeah.

Lenny (01:21:07):
Amazing. I will check that out. Okay. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?

Chris Miller (01:21:12):
I think it depends on what level of role that they're interviewing for. I don't really interview as many frontline PMs anymore, but I used to really like doing case study questions and really random ones too. I'd be like, "Tell me how many people crossed the Longfellow Bridge in a week." And I could not care less what the actual number they arrived at was, but it's more for me to observe what's the array of data points that they can kind of start to collect in their mind to inform their calculus, and how close can they get to ballpark, and what's their defense behind their thinking. And then just the process of watching people's brains move in those moments is... You learn a lot about how they might operate as a product manager I think in those scenarios. I try not to overdo them, because I do think there's a lot of inherent bias in some of those types of questions. And so trying to think of things that are really relatable to anybody who might be looking to work on a team that I'm leading is I think a requirement there.

(01:22:23):
But I would say the other question I really like to ask is, if the people that you most recently worked with were in a room and you weren't there, how would they talk about you? One, it's because sometimes I will reach out and get references, and so the extent to which that might actually be part of the interview process is very legitimate, but also I think it is usually very clear whether the person is taking an honest and introspective and self-aware approach to answering that question. And I like to see people being really self-aware, because I don't think anybody ever comes in any situation perfect. I have a lot of rough edges to my personality that I think people have just learned to deal with over the years, but I try to be self-aware about them at the... If I can do nothing else, if I can't change them, at least recognize them and do what I can to mitigate the blast radius.

(01:23:17):
And so I think just getting a sense of the EQ of a candidate and their self-awareness is really important for me because at the end of the day, if you're in product, you can be the smartest person in the room, but if people don't want to work with you, you're probably not going to go very far.

Lenny (01:23:32):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you come back to or you share with other people?

Chris Miller (01:23:38):
The details matter.

Lenny (01:23:39):
And that's both in work and life, I imagine?

Chris Miller (01:23:41):
Yeah, the details matter. The details matter. I read a cool interview with the product leadership team at Stripe, and one of the things they talk about is for their product managers, they want you to have taste. And it was a really kind of controversial thing to say because it was like, "Oh, that is so subjective. Who gets to decide what taste is?" Maybe that's even biased to some extent.

(01:24:07):
And I think they had a super defensible answer about how they define taste, and taste in their opinion was to be so interested in something, it doesn't matter what that thing is, where you can go deep enough in it to have a strong set of informed opinions. And that's how they defined it. And they were almost ambivalent to what that thing that was, what the subject was. But having taste, having something that you were passionate about, that you have spent enough time learning and understanding and appreciating and critiquing and being frustrated with that you have a point of view that is potentially even polarizing is taste. Riding the fence is usually not taste. And so when I think about the details matter, that's almost like a nod to taste. Obsess over the details of something, whether that be art, music, product, film, whatever. I care a lot about that.

Lenny (01:25:11):
I love that. And that comes back to a lot of the things we've talked about of talking to customers, looking the data, actually having the firsthand information on what people need and what people want from your product.

Chris Miller (01:25:22):
Yeah, absolutely.

Lenny (01:25:24):
Okay. I'm just going to ask two more, and I'll let you go. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?

Chris Miller (01:25:30):
I fell in love with golf right before the pandemic, but the pandemic really is when I lost my mind and was obsessed with golf. It was one of the few safe things that you could do outside that was social and less dangerous than getting a drink with your buddy at the bar. That's the joke. It's like men invented golf so they could go on walks with each other, and that's essentially what kind of drove the interest in golf. And I also was horrible at it when I first started.

(01:25:59):
And so I think also as you get older and maybe you get more established in your career, or I've been in a product-led growth sort of lane for a while. You almost forget what it's like to be really bad at something until you have a kid and then everything's new and you're failing every day.

(01:26:18):
But golf was a refreshing, consistent experience of frustration and inadequacy and just really embracing that and just waiting in it for a while knowing that it's just going to take cycles and time to get better and better. It was something I got really addicted to, and so I tried to play golf whenever I can, and most recently I bought a Garmin watch, and that thing is just magical. You roll up to the first tee box, you look at your watch, it knows exactly where you are, which golf course. Sometimes it'll even tell you which tees you're at, because in golf sometimes you're further back and sometimes you're further ahead, and it tracks your swings, it tells you distances.

Lenny (01:26:57):
That's insane.

Chris Miller (01:26:57):
It reads the greens for you.

Lenny (01:26:58):
Wow. I just want to play golf just to use that watch.

Chris Miller (01:27:01):
Oh my gosh, some of the guys that I golf with, a couple of them had one recently and I just was enthralled by it and I literally went home and ordered it that same day. And it's been the coolest product or gadget that I bought in a while.

Lenny (01:27:15):
Damn. I love it. And I was also thinking as you were talking about getting into golf connects back to your relentless curiosity and resilience that you look for in people that you hire. So clearly you have it yourself.

(01:27:27):
Final question, I believe you have a dog named Ferney, which is short for Fernet.

Chris Miller (01:27:31):
Yes.

Lenny (01:27:31):
Okay. So on that note, what is your favorite current cocktail, if it's not just a shot of Fernet?

Chris Miller (01:27:36):
The nightcap is always a shot of Fernet. Sometimes you might mix a little Coca-Cola with that. I think, where do they do that? Is that Spain?

Lenny (01:27:46):
I have not heard of that.

Chris Miller (01:27:47):
Or Argentina. I don't know. It's definitely a country that that's a thing. My wife has been really into really high quality margaritas, made at home, and we're big into Aperol Spritz in the summer, so I would say that that's usually what dominates the happy hour rotation these days.

Lenny (01:28:06):
I just had an Aperol. Is it Aperol? Aperol Spritz, right?

Chris Miller (01:28:09):
Yeah. I'm not good at pronunciation. It's probably one of those two.

Lenny (01:28:12):
I just had that for the first time. It's amazing. That's going to be my new go-to.

Chris Miller (01:28:16):
You had an Aperol Spritz for the first time recently?

Lenny (01:28:18):
Yes. I didn't know what that was.

Chris Miller (01:28:21):
That was like the zeitgeist a couple summers ago and then there, oh man. There's the other one too. The Negroni Sbagliatos are having a moment too. It's like a Negroni with Prosecco. I forget.

Lenny (01:28:36):
Ooh, that sounds amazing. There's so much knowledge to be gained in this podcast episode. Chris, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you a question or two. And two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Chris Miller (01:28:52):
You can connect with me on LinkedIn. Shoot me a message. Christopher Miller. There's a lot of Christopher Millers. I'm the one that looks like me, works for HubSpot. I have a Twitter. I don't spend ton of time... X. I have an X account, but I don't spend a lot of time on the app, formerly known as the bird app, but I'm on Instagram @millsyjoeyoung, which is a nod to one of my favorite old monster films, Mighty Joe Young. And so yeah, I'm on Instagram a bunch, too. That's where you can find me.

Lenny (01:29:20):
Then I know two other things that you wanted to share. One is that you advise on PLG and things like that, so maybe talk about that real briefly. And then also you're hiring at HubSpot, or can people know about that?

Chris Miller (01:29:31):
I definitely do a bit of angel investing and advising companies on the side, and I really enjoy it. I think there's something really cool and awesome about getting to see fresh problems all the time and not necessarily being so laser focused on the sort of categories or verticals or target customers that you're dealing with for 40 plus hours a week. And so it's kind of refreshing to spend time with founders who are working on products in different categories and having different challenges at different stages of growth and being able to figure out how I can be a resource to them. And so if you're looking for, if that sounds interesting to you, you're a founder or head of product out there, definitely reach out and maybe opportunities for us to collaborate and maybe that can be a resource.

Lenny (01:30:21):
Cool. And then on the hiring front, any specific roles you want people to know about that you might be hiring?

Chris Miller (01:30:25):
There'll definitely be more roles opening up in the fall, but I think most immediately I'll be looking for a group product manager to work on the AI platform team that I'm leading.

Lenny (01:30:35):
What a role.

Chris Miller (01:30:37):
Yeah, it's a great role with a fantastic team and a space that might be a little important these days. And so if you go to the HubSpot job site, that role should be there by the time this podcast is live. That role should definitely be up there.

Lenny (01:30:50):
Amazing. Chris, thank you again for being here.

Chris Miller (01:30:53):
Lenny, pleasure. Thank you for having me. This has been amazing.

Lenny (01:30:56):

# An inside look at Figma’s unique GTM motion | Claire Butler (first GTM hire)

## Transcript

Claire Butler (00:00:00):
We had Coda. They were our first user, and they were based in Palo Alto. Dylan and I drove down and demoed the product to them, and they were the first ones. Their designer, Jeremy was like, "Yes, we'll take this on full time." And I remember we were both like, "What? Really? You will?" That was the first person who said yes to us. And so, we were so excited. This was a huge milestone. We were just so stoked. And then we got back to the office, and I think Dylan gets a text from Jeremy being like, "Oh yeah, I tried to share this with Philippe, my engineer, and he can't get the file to open, so I guess we can't use it." And we're like, "What is it? What happened?" Finally got someone. And I remember Dylan was like, "Everybody drop everything. We have to fix this."
(00:00:37):
And after some looking at the servers and things, they were like, "Nothing's wrong." And then they realized there's a problem with Philippe's MacBook. And Evan down only had a car, so Dylan had to drive Evan down to Palo Alto to fix the MacBook of Philippe just to get them to use the product.
Lenny (00:00:55):

(00:03:50):
Claire, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.
Claire Butler (00:03:54):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm excited to be here.
Lenny (00:03:56):
You've been on my wishlist of guests for a long time, and so I'm really excited to be finally chatting. You were the 10th employee at Figma, which is now worth tens of billions of dollars depending on which valuation you look at, and probably thousands of employees. I don't even know, but many, many. And you joined before the product even launched. And so, I have a million questions I want to ask about how Figma grew and all the things that went into it. I'm curious what it was like to be early days at Figma. Is there a memory that comes to mind that's zany, funny, fun, tangible of just what it was like to work at Figma in the early days?
Claire Butler (00:04:33):
Yeah, totally. No, that's a good question. We were right downtown on New Montgomery and Minna, and I think the thing that sticks out to me is actually two competing stories that talk about just how much at that time you'd oscillate between these really high-level strategic decisions and then total current work.
(00:04:50):
So my first day at Figma, I come into the office and we're going through some stuff. There's like 10 of us in the office, we're chatting, and I look at some of the plans, some of the things they're working on, and I see that they were actually had some branding and positioning and things that the products, Figma, was going to be named Summit, that was the name. So the company was going to be Figma, and then the product suite, the product design tool was going to be Summit with the idea that eventually we'll have other tools and that could be like mountaintop or I don't know what the rule, they had a whole thing around the different things that could be for the future product set.
(00:05:27):
And I remember my first day, I had an immediate reaction of like, " We cannot make this thing Summit. That's not going to work. We can't have two brands. Summit's not ownable, we can't build equity and multiple things. That's just never going to work. We kind of have to just stick with one." And I think Figma is ownable and makes sense and we should just go with Figma. So we kind of should probably kill the Summit thing. And Dylan said to me, he was like, "Oh, that's interesting. How about you make a presentation and present it to everyone tomorrow?" And so I did that. I was like, "Oh, okay, I guess this is what I'm doing the rest of the day." So I went and made a little presentation about how we couldn't build all this equity in two places and all of the things, and then the next day we decided to kill that name.
(00:06:05):
And so we went with Figma for the name of the product instead of Summit. And that's how fast things moved, right? And how much you just ran with it and how to ownership. I compare that to the first meetup we had, which was probably just 10 people in the office, honestly. But I remember I was in charge of that, so I had to get all the food and everything there, and I just Instacarted some things and ordered some pizza, but I'd forgotten ice. And so I had to go walk down to the nearest corner store, which was three blocks away or something, and get ice. And I got four bags. And I remember I was walking down the street down probably third street with three bags of ice and it was really heavy. And I remember thinking, "This is so hard. This is so heavy. I can't carry all this ice." And it's just like that's... I did that too probably the next week.
(00:06:50):
And so, I think it was just this oscillation between like, "Oh, we're making these high level strategic decisions and someone else has to go by the ice." So that's what it was like at Figma in the early days.
Lenny (00:06:59):
That's incredible. That's almost a metaphor. Someone's got to go carry the ice.
Claire Butler (00:07:04):
Almost got to the ice for the meetup. Yep.
Lenny (00:07:06):
That's so interesting about Summit, I had no idea that was [inaudible 00:07:09]-
Claire Butler (00:07:09):
That wasn't a good name. So if you liked that better, I'm sorry because I killed that.
Lenny (00:07:13):
Who could like it better now that everyone loves Figma and that's just what it is? Do you think Figma would've been as successful with that name, looking back?
Claire Butler (00:07:21):
I think we probably would've changed it later. I think we just saved ourselves some time and without having to change it.
Lenny (00:07:27):
And then how many days or weeks into your tenure was that happening?
Claire Butler (00:07:32):
The name change or...
Lenny (00:07:32):
Yeah.
Claire Butler (00:07:34):
The first day. No, that was literally my first day.
Lenny (00:07:36):
The first day.
Claire Butler (00:07:36):
No, no, no. That was my first day and my second day. Not even kidding. My first day, I made the recommendation, the second day, give the presentation and the decision was made.
Lenny (00:07:45):
Wow. I was going to ask you what the most stressful memory of early days Figma was. I'm guessing it's the same story.
Claire Butler (00:07:50):
It's not actually. So I think the most stressful thing, I was thinking about this, was when we launched out of stealth. So I come into Figma, I had lots of experience. I'd been in another startup before that, I launched stuff, but I was still kind of junior. I had done these things, but I didn't have a ton of cycles, and I never ran the whole thing from like, okay, messaging and positioning. This was a forcing function for us to do our messaging and positioning. And I remember there was more than one day where we locked ourselves in a conference room and I made Dylan and show at the time have this positioning up on the big screen and made them agree on it word for word. We'd just never done that before. But then I'd also never run PR press and all of a sudden, I had to run press and PR.
(00:08:36):
And I think the hardest part there and the most stressful part was I didn't have anyone to talk to. It was just me. And I didn't at the time have enough cycles to have the confidence that the decisions I was making were the right ones. And so it was hard not to second guess myself sometimes in that position. And I think that's some of the hardest times of being at a startup, especially when you're the only marketer, the only go-to-market person is, you don't have anyone to talk to, to like got check stuff with. And so it does take this immense confidence in yourself, but that's stressful when you don't have the cycles. And so that was very stressful for me for sure.
Lenny (00:09:12):
How did you overcome that? Did you find people to work with and run ideas by? Did you just do it and figure it out?
Claire Butler (00:09:19):
I mean, I had Dylan, but we just did it, right? Especially in those early days. I remember there were a couple of freak out moments where I would try to get our VCs to help us. I remember Greylock was helpful at least over there, but ultimately, they help a lot, but they don't know your business as intimately as you do. So at the end of the day, that's something Dylan's really good at is trusting his intuition and gut. And so, he was helpful on the decision making, but then also you just got to go for it. And I think that that's something that I learned at that time that's helped me throughout the rest of my career is building that confidence or that trust in yourself because it wasn't something that I necessarily immediately had.
Lenny (00:09:55):
Next question I wanted to get into briefly is, you joined Figma really early, became one of the most successful, loved companies in history. What did you see early on that convinced you that Figma was the company to join and ask? Because a lot of people today are looking for places to join and trying to decide what to do. Clearly, you made a good choice. What did you see?
Claire Butler (00:10:14):
So I had been another startup before Figma, a little bit bigger. I think I joined at Series B and then got through on acquisition. And I had a sense that I wanted to do something early. And I'd already made that decision that I wanted to go early stage. So I'll take that decision making part out. But then from there, I was talking to a couple different companies, and when I went to Figma, there were three areas that stood out the most to me.
(00:10:36):
The first was, it logically made sense. And I know maybe that sounds basic, but I was talking to just a drone company or a SaaS tech, like ad tech company, and I just didn't get it, honestly, it didn't intuitively make sense to me or I didn't understand the technology or something. But at Figma, the basic premise immediately logically clicked for me like, "Oh yeah, I use Google Docs, I use Asana, I use all these online tools. That's so weird. That design's not online. Why isn't it?"
(00:11:06):
And as a marketer, I'd worked with designers and sent feedback and emails, and that's really inefficient. And it made a ton of sense to me that yes, that should be online and collaborative. So that was the first thing that I was like check the box. And the next one was, I knew people who believed in it. So I got introduced to Dylan via Index. They were an investor at the last company I was at, and Danny Rimer specifically. And my old boss, Greg Smearon, who was an EIR there. And I trusted them a lot and they invested in it. I also met John Lilly. I didn't know who he was. I had to Google him, but he seemed really smart. And when they Googled in, he was very impressive, and he believed in it. So that was great.
(00:11:43):
And then I think the third thing was, I remember when I was trying to decide, Dylan really didn't take no for answer. He's very persuasive. And I remember he'd calling me and text me and then I'd have all these concerns or things and he would just pick them apart one by one of reasons why they weren't real concerns or things to get over them. And so I think that that was the third thing is, that's just who he was and that's how he is with everything. And so, if that's how with me, that's how he is with any obstacle that he has. And so, when I looked at that, I was just like, "All right, let's give this a go." And I didn't know. I didn't know. I had no idea it would be as big as it is today. So some of it was luck too, for sure. But those are the three things of how I made my decision.
Lenny (00:12:24):
So what I took away there is, one, you just believe in idea, obviously. Make sure you actually think this could be really big, two is some social proof people you trust really believe in it. In this case, it was really smart investors, they knew. And then the third is, it sounds like you were also just impressed with Dylan.
Claire Butler (00:12:40):
Yeah, totally. I believed in him.
Lenny (00:12:42):
So you joined Figma before it even launched, it was still in stealth. You joined as the first go-to-market hire. You helped launch Figma, you continue to lead go-to market at Figma. And so this is a good segue to where I want to spend most of our conversation. I essentially want to try to unpack what worked to build Figma into the business that it is today from beginning to even now. You're also there for eight years. So you saw a lot of what worked and didn't work. And so let's start with the beginnings of Figma and the go-to-market motion that you developed and how you actually implemented it. So maybe to start, if you could just talk about just what is a bottom up go-to-market motion? And then you also shared somewhere that Figma has a very unique bottom-up go-to-market motion. So maybe just those two areas, just broadly, what is bottom-up go- to-market motion, and then two, what is unique about Figma's approach?
Claire Butler (00:13:33):
I've reflected back to get to some of these answers. I think in the moment, so much of what we were doing was influenced by gut, by trying to connect with people, listening to them. But when I look back is when I'm like, "Oh, this is a repeatable motion." So when I look back at it, I would say that if I were to define and think about how I define our go-to-market motion, and we've said it, we've called it a lot of things over time. We called it product-led, we called it community-led. The way I think about it now is this bottoms-up motion, that really is focused on ICs. So it's all focused on like, "Okay, so you have this core audience." For us it was designers and they're largely individual contributors, so they're people who are practitioners who are using your tool. For us, it's like eight hours a day.
(00:14:17):
If you're a designer, you're in it all the time. And they love you, and you build this relationship with them within the product, but it's beyond the product, right? It's also believing what the product can be in the company and the brand. And they love you so much that they're willing to put their social capital and themselves in the line and spread the product throughout whatever their communities are. And the one that's connected the most to revenue is companies.
(00:14:45):
And so that's where the revenue model really clicks in is you have all these individual contributors who love you, but then they also work at these big companies and these big orgs, and they become these internal champions who spearhead adoption within their organizations and eventually turn into large amounts of revenue. And I think of that as our bottoms-up motion. And that's different from tops-down. And a lot of SaaS is tops-down where you go straight to a VP or an executive buyer, they then agree to buying a tool and then that goes down to their organization. I think with technical tools especially, this becomes really important. The practitioners have to love it. And also, sometimes I wondered as an executive care, you know what I mean, what tools people are using?
(00:15:27):
And so for Figma, what that looks like and why this is so efficient of a go-to-market motion for us is, we actually didn't have a sales team for the first three years. So all of our revenue, it was paid, but it was all self-serve. And so we'd work with these. We weren't worried about things. I mean, you cared about security, but all of the org features that people need and want when you're working with procurement, we were just focused on technical features for users mostly. And then the individual contributor or maybe the manager would just put them on their credit card. That was the way that things grew. And so there was no sales team for a long time. We did have one eventually, and I'll talk about what that looked like.
(00:16:04):
But then the second thing was, once we did have a sales team, and even up until now, so much of our revenue and our sales and our MQLs, our marketing qualified leads come from our free tier. So it's people, they're using it, maybe they use it for free. We have a very robust free tier. Maybe they use it for pro, which is on your credit card. And then once it's widespread and they've gained the confidence, then they're ready to bring in sales work with procurement. And they actually come to us and they're like, "Hey, I work at this company. I really want to get my whole company to use it, but security's not letting me. Can you help me unblock it with them?"
(00:16:39):
We didn't spend that much money, any money really programmatically on paid or programmatic marketing because all of our leads for sales would come in through a form on our website, which was current users either free or pro wanting to upgrade. And at that point, it's a very different sales conversation to unblock someone or to just help them implement Figma when they've already have an internal champion who's bought in, and they're really the one leading and driving the sale within their organization. So I think that that's made us really efficient as like this is a really efficient model and has really powered so much of our growth over time.
Lenny (00:17:14):
Somebody listening to this that has a saying, B2B SaaS companies like, "Oh, okay, I just need to get people to love my product and it's going to be great." And so I want to unpack that just like what you did because it wasn't obviously an accident that people loved Figma. But before we get there, you talked about that there's a unique approach to the way you did bottom up. What do you see as what the typical bottom-up go-to-market motion is that other companies try to play that you think Figma did differently? Is it this obsession with ICs on teams or is there some other element of it?
Claire Butler (00:17:43):
I think there are other people who do bottoms-up and who do it well. I think for us it's unique because the individual contributor spends so much time in the tool, and it's so important to them. I think about things that we focus on where it might take one click off of someone's workflow, and that seems like a really small update. You have to click one time instead of twice to do something.
(00:18:06):
When you're a designer and you're in a tool eight hours a day, saving that one click is huge. And so I think the obsession with quality and with craft within the editor for us, for Figma, is maybe the difference. And I think about other go-to-market tools that maybe focus so much on the collaboration side or the product-led of the expansion. And that is a huge part segue, don't get me wrong, but the tool itself, the editor, that's where it all starts and that's what these people love. And then the collaboration is like, yes, it's the thing that's like our differentiator, but it's actually like you stay for the collaboration. You don't want to talk about it or learn about it. Nobody wants talk about collaboration. You just want it to work, right? You care about the tool and that the tool's working well. And so I think that maybe that's the difference is the obsession with the tool itself.
Lenny (00:18:52):
Awesome. Yeah, something I learned recently is that multiplayer wasn't even a part of Figma at launch, [inaudible 00:18:56] a year later.
Claire Butler (00:18:58):
I know. We can talk about that, and we want to know making a decision of when to go to self because we almost didn't because it didn't have multiplayer.
Lenny (00:19:04):
Oh yeah, let's talk about that.
Claire Butler (00:19:05):
Yeah, that was a poor differentiator and we can't not have it, but then we did anyway.
Lenny (00:19:10):
Yeah, let's take a tangent there actually. Just that decision to go from stealth. So Figma was in stealth three years or four years before [inaudible 00:19:17] idea.
Claire Butler (00:19:17):
Gosh, three, I guess. I think is 2012 that they started, and then we launched in at the end of 2015. So between around there, yeah, around three or four.
Lenny (00:19:27):
Cool. And then you joined right before they launched. We're going to come back to what we were talking about, but just what did you see about that decision of now's the time to launch?
Claire Butler (00:19:34):
Yeah, I think it was a couple things. So I think the first thing is that the team had been building quietly by themselves in isolation for three years. And that's hard. I think that that was a very real part of the decision to get out of stealth was that people had been building for such a long time. We needed momentum. We needed to have a milestone that we were working towards. We could have just kept building it quiet for a long time more, but it was very demotivating. So that was a very big part of this. So there was a desire holistically to get out of stealth. But we didn't want to do it until we knew it'd at least be successful. But that was a key thing for me. I was working on that messaging, positioning that I was telling you, like we would have this.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]I still have the doc actually where I was like, projected on the screen and Dylan and Sean and I picked apart every word of it and sharing with a link and multiplayer is the biggest thing. That's the core differentiator. It's really funny. I remember Ivan from Notion's early days, he stopped by and was chatting, and he's like, "Wait, you can't launch with that multiplayer." And I was like, "I know." So I was like, everybody was like, that was the core thing.
(00:20:36):
But the idea was that we wanted to get out of stealth. We talked to Evan, our CTO, and knew it would take about another year for him to build it. And for me it was like, "Well, is there enough here to get people excited to start and to get users, get more feedback?" Because Evan was kind of building multiplayer. I don't know enough about the engineering if he was doing it on his own or not, but he was the key person doing it. But there are a lot of other things too that were being built or could be built through that year. And we wanted to get more feedback from people and to start really get started.
(00:21:05):
And so to me, the things that I wanted to see before just deciding like, "Okay, so we don't have our key feature. Can we still launch, or is there enough fear for people to get excited?" At least my first three months, especially before we get going for the launch with the product, and probably even after that, I would just go around with Dylan and pilot or demo Figma to companies. That was a lot of what we did. So we'd go to these companies and we'd show them Figma and we'd get their feedback, and I would be driving around in Palo Alto, around the city doing that with Dylan. And sometimes people didn't care. They were just like, "What is this? I don't want to design online," things like that.
(00:21:47):
But what we wanted to see, what I wanted to see was that designers were excited when they saw the tool. And once we got enough features, and I saw this pretty quickly actually when I joined Figma, is that the people that we showed it to were really interested in it and cared about it. And I remember after Vector Networks came out, after some of our other core features, there were enough things where people, I remember, they would take the laptop out of Dylan's hands when he would start showing it because they wanted to play with it. And to me, when I started seeing designers do that, even if I wasn't sure if they'd use it as a team, even if I wasn't sure if they'd buy it, we weren't selling it yet. They wanted to try it and they were excited about it.
(00:22:28):
And that kind of emotion, no reaction of wanting to play with it in these demos was really what gave me confidence that we were ready to launch. And we had a couple teams, small numbers, and happened to talk about metrics and how hard it is to deal with metrics of this size, but very small numbers. But we had teams who were using it full-time. So we knew that some people were using it full-time and people who weren't were really excited to try and were very impressed with the technical feat of it all and interested. And to me that was enough confidence that like, "Okay, it's worth it. Let's get out of stealth."
Lenny (00:23:02):
That story of the-
PART 1 OF 4 ENDS [00:23:04]
Claire Butler (00:23:00):
... let's get out of stealth.
Lenny (00:23:02):
That story of the potential customer pulling the laptop from Dylan is such a good metaphor for product market fit, which people describe as you feel pull. Someone's literally pulling it from your hands. You talked about metrics that you maybe could share. What could you share there?
Claire Butler (00:23:19):
At these early days, especially with bottoms-up and with all these things... And people ask me all the time, "How do you measure things in an early stage situation?" And I maybe have a controversial point of view here. I don't think you can, from a metrics side. Your numbers are so small. One of the quotes I always like to say, and I say this now too, when we're doing stuff, because we're launching new products [inaudible 00:23:40] and it comes up a lot, is you can't optimize your way to product market fit. I don't care at the early stages if something's optimized by 5% from an email.
(00:23:50):
That doesn't fundamentally tell me if something's working or not, so I think metrics are really hard and signal is actually way more important. Can you get a couple people who love it, not a slight improvement of a conversion of a landing page. And so I think that metrics are really hard in that way. They can help you, but when the numbers are so small, you have to, again, trust yourself a lot more and have more intuition, but then also find more signal of the things that are working, whether it's anecdotal, talking to people, examples, and that becomes much more useful than hard metrics are sometimes.
Lenny (00:24:26):
I'm working on a post around product market fit and a step-by-step somewhat of our guide to help people down this path. The way you described it is the way I'm thinking about it, is step one, get one company to use your product.
Claire Butler (00:24:37):
Yes.
Lenny (00:24:38):
Step two-
Claire Butler (00:24:38):
What do they want? That was step one, and then that's not easy. That's not easy.
Lenny (00:24:42):
Right. And then it's like, get them to continue using your product.
Claire Butler (00:24:42):
Yes.
Lenny (00:24:46):
And then it's get two companies to use your product.
Claire Butler (00:24:46):
Yes, exactly.
Lenny (00:24:49):
And then get someone to pay for your product. Yeah, so there's all these major milestones. Along those same lines, I saw an interview with Dylan talking about product market fit, and he had this interesting quote about how he realized first that they had product market fit a year later, which is when Microsoft, I think, was like, "Take our money. We want to pay for Figma." And he's like, "Okay, maybe this is going to work." Does that sound about right?
Claire Butler (00:25:11):
Well, it's interesting, and that goes up to the bottoms-up model that we could talk about. I think the difference, if you think about a company like Microsoft and what this looks like, this is just a really good example of this bottoms-up motion in market. Here's a funny story that I want to add. Our first meeting with Microsoft actually came, and this is the scrappiness of working in an early stage startup, because I slid into the DMs of my friend's ex-boyfriend. That's how we got our first meeting with Microsoft.
Lenny (00:25:41):
Well done.
Claire Butler (00:25:41):
I know, I know. I saw that they had signed up for Figma, and I was like, "Wait a minute. I think I know this person." And that's how we chatted with them and first got feedback from them, so that's just a funny anecdote.
Lenny (00:25:53):
This could be a new strategy if everyone's going to try to-
Claire Butler (00:25:55):
You literally do whatever. Uber driver, shared Lyfts, we can talk more about that. But yeah, you got to do whatever you can to get early people to try your product out and get really scrappy. But for Microsoft, over time, we would have, I think it was... What was the team that got acquired that we went into Microsoft? I'll have to remember the name, but it was a small team within Microsoft and they were... Xamarin, it was Xamarin. They were to ones who were using Figma first, and we saw that, so they were that patient zero at Microsoft. And then we had, slowly over time, more pockets within Microsoft using the tool.
(00:26:28):
But again, we've never gone through Microsoft procurement, Microsoft security. It just started popping up throughout the organization. And we have these really cool Node graphs that show this too, where you'd have these little pockets of people and then it would jump to another, like they'd have one more collaborator and then jump from another pocket. There were these really cool maps of how that spread within the organization. And eventually, we got to the point where that was a very comprehensive Node graph that had this massive thing of all of these people from Microsoft using the product.
(00:26:55):
But still, it was only on credit cards. I don't think we even had an enterprise product at this point, and so there was no salesperson for them to talk to. And Microsoft was like, "Wait a minute. We need to organize this. We need security. We need account management. We need procurement involved." And I think that that's what it was. They wanted to pay for it and they wanted us to have this enterprise product, because they had these requirements and they wanted to have a better control over it, because it was just popping up within the organization without their control. And so that's probably a good example of what that looked like as this bottoms in motion just spread to a really large organization.
Lenny (00:27:34):
This Node graph thing, is that a tool you built that's showing, helping you visualize within a company how it's all clustering? Or what is that?
Claire Butler (00:27:41):
Well, our data science team built it. I don't know if it's like... Yes, I'm sure it's an internal tool. I just remember there was a website in Node or something that we would use, and you could type it in an organization's name. You still could do this. It's within our data analytics system. You type in the name of an organization and it just pulls up everybody. And it shows, because Figma spreads through new users, but also gen one, gen two, these people invite people. And you can see these Node graphs of how somebody started Figma, maybe at the center, and then they invited someone else, and then it shows how that spread.
(00:28:16):
And so you get these clusters, and you can see the clusters are teams, but then you can see someone invited someone in a different org to a file and then that started a new center of a cluster. They're really interesting. And you can pull up, you can type in any org, any org at Figma and see what that Node graph looks like. But they're super interesting to see how those spread.
Lenny (00:28:37):
That is super cool. And I imagine that also informs how you go to market by figuring out who spreads to who and who's often [inaudible 00:28:45].
Claire Butler (00:28:44):
Totally, and that's when these internal champions, that's what the key is. And that's maybe the takeaway of how important these internal champions are, because you just need someone to land there and then them maybe passing it up. You could hover over and see this person's at the center of this Node graph and all of these people that spread from this one person at the company. And that, I think, was the unlock to be like, "Oh yeah, these internal champions, they're really the key to all of this."
Lenny (00:29:12):
I remember it spreading at Airbnb early on. I think Airbnb was one of the early customers and it was just one designer, a few designers starting to spread to the product managers. I was just a member on the team being like, "Goddamn it, we just switched to Sketch. Are we going to switch again to a new product?"
Claire Butler (00:29:25):
That was the hardest thing to feel like I don't want to switch twice. That was definitely something we had to get over.
Lenny (00:29:29):
But it happened for good reasons. Okay, one last thing that you mentioned that I wanted to follow up on. You said something about shared Lyfts, and maybe that's a funny story of some sort.
Claire Butler (00:29:38):
Oh, I don't know specifically. Actually, Dylan specifically is such a hustler, especially in those early days. And he would just, really anyone that he would meet, he would talk about Figma with them. I don't remember who it was, but there was definitely a situation where he met someone in a Lyft and then they became one of our users. He used every angle he could to try to get introduced to new designers, especially in his pre-launch days where we didn't have as many connections to just get people to try it out and get more feedback.
Lenny (00:30:06):
Okay, cool. Let's get back on track. We were talking about the go-to-market motion that you executed and modeled at Figma. There's two steps, right? Step one is get ICs to love you, and then step two is help it spread from that person, right?
Claire Butler (00:30:21):
Yep, yep.
Lenny (00:30:23):
Okay, cool. So, let's start with step one.
Claire Butler (00:30:25):
Okay, cool.
Lenny (00:30:25):
Like I said, obviously, it'd be awesome if somebody loved your product at a company. What did you actually do to make that happen in the early days?
Claire Butler (00:30:31):
Yeah. It's really interesting when you think about the early days too, because you're like, "All right. We don't exist." How do you get them to love you when literally, they've never heard of you before? Also, like you were saying, in your situation, "Oh, I used Sketch. I was maybe in Photoshop before that, something else. I just made the switch over to this new tool. We finally got it working. I really don't want to move tools again." You have that inherent thing against it there. Especially I thought about this, and I think there are four main areas that we focused on to make this start, to get it going, and then we kind of still do this stuff today.
(00:31:05):
The first thing is all about credibility. I think in the early days especially, credibility is so important in establishing that initial credibility, again, especially with a technical audience like designers. The second is actually building the product with your users. And I know you had Sho on your podcast and he talked a lot about this too, just the customer obsession that we have the care of, especially that editor tool.
(00:31:28):
The third is finding a place where you can, in a way, that you can build this relationship over time. Maybe that's specifically through a channel where they don't have to come to you, because they don't really care about you yet and they're probably not going to convert right away or start using you right away, so how do you get them to stick with you over time? So, find out the channel where you can do that and then continue to build that relationship with them. And then the four is just being extremely transparent and honest to build that relationship with people. I know those all sound really fuzzy, so maybe we can go into them specifically.
Lenny (00:31:28):
Absolutely. I was going to ask.
Claire Butler (00:32:04):
Because they sound really fuzzy when you talk about them. A lot of this stuff is hard like that, where you're like, "Oh, that just sounds like buzzwords." I can give you some examples of these four things, so maybe it helps to give some color to it.
Lenny (00:32:13):
Great.
Claire Butler (00:32:14):
Let's start with the first one, credibility. Okay. I was the first marketer at Figma. I think one of the things I learned right away, very quickly was that designers don't want to hear from marketers. They don't want to be marketed to and they have an extremely high bullshit meter. You use a word like efficiency, collaboration, all of those buzzwords, and they're just like, "I don't want to hear this." Traditional product marketing kind of stuff just doesn't work. They wanted to hear technical features. They wanted to understand how technical features work. They want to hear, "How am I going to use this?" And then they'll see the benefits, but they don't want to hear from marketers and they don't want to be marketed to.
(00:32:55):
And so I think especially with our audience in the early days, one of the things that I did was really try to not market. And that's so funny as a marketer to say that, but that was really core to build authenticity with people. And so the way that we did that in the early days was what we had was the tool, and that's pretty much what we had, and we had a design team and we had an engineering team. We did some cool stuff in the tool. First of all, the tool itself was a technical feat. It was the first time it used video game technology, WebGL. Evan's a prodigy. The fact that he got a design tool to work on the internet was just amazing, and so there was a lot of engineering interest there, credibility building of, "How did you get this to work?"
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]I got him to make technical content and that, I think, went to number one on Hacker News, that people were just interested in him. And then we had a design team, and our design team was our target audience. And so we talked a lot about how we chose to build features, all the things that went into it. And so many of the primitives of design tools have been like that forever, and so we changed the stuff. One of them would be how we did grids or how we did vector networks, and we'd go into these really deep details of how we chose to make those product decisions, all the craft decisions that went into it.
(00:34:08):
I remember one of my bars were deciding if something would hit this or not, if they would be interested was, "Did I understand it?" You know what I mean? And if I understood it, it was probably too basic, or if I could have written it myself, it was probably too basic. I remember we did one on grids in the early days, and we went really deep on Joseph Muller Brockmann and his influence on grids. And now, I very much know who Joseph Muller Brockmann is because I work with designers, but at the time, I had to Google it. I was like, "Who is this?" But that was one of my bars for if something would be good enough for our technical content, was if I could have written it, it's not good enough. And so that was key for us in building credibility, because we had this design team.
(00:34:47):
And then when six months after we launched, I actually got to hire someone to do marketing with me, the first person I hired was actually a designer advocate. So it was not a marketer, it was someone who was a designer. The designers and the engineers that I was trying to get to help me with stuff also had to design and build the product, so they didn't have a ton of time. But this designer advocate was working full-time with me on this stuff, and he came from our user base. He was one of the very few people in the early days who just loved the product and was very passionate about it. And that became his full-time job was to represent, to meet with users, talk to them, to write content and create content, and to bring that back to the product, and that was what he did.
(00:35:32):
And that designer advocacy positions actually scaled with Figma, and we still have it today. It's extreme. I think it's the magic dust, we call it, that we sprinkle on go-to-market to make a lot of our go-to-market function work. But yeah, we didn't focus on marketing, or traditional marketing. We're very focused on the technical aspects.
Lenny (00:35:50):
There's so many little lessons there. The designer advocate hire reminds me of something that Datadog did, where they hired engineers to write their blog posts.
Claire Butler (00:35:59):
That's a great idea. Yes, exactly what we did. Yes.
Lenny (00:36:03):
So, ways you build credibility, just kind of mirroring back what you just shared, one is writing content. Basically, putting out blog posts that designers would be like, "Oh, wow. This is really interesting," and start to feel like, "Oh, Figma keeps coming up in these really interesting pieces of content."
Claire Butler (00:36:15):
Yeah, even if they were using it, and I think that that was important. When we launched, people wanted to test it because it was cool and see what it is, but then they bounced. They're like, "All right. This isn't advanced enough. I'll come back later." Which is why we're give them reasons to come back, being like, "Oh, yeah, but the pen tools always worked like this, but we did it like that. You should test that out." And so we kept giving them these nuggets of reasons to come back in. Remember, this was also before multiplayer, and so we couldn't collaborate, so it was use the tools to do these things. That really helps people come back into the tool and spend a little bit more time in it.
Lenny (00:36:49):
How many posts would you say you put out in that first six months, just to give people a sense of here's how much? It's probably not a ton, right? It's probably some few really good ones.
Claire Butler (00:36:57):
They took a long time. Also, I had to work with an engineer or a designer to do every single one. Maybe 10 at most. But those ones that went out, we tried to get on Hacker News. We tried to get on Designer News at the time. Twitter, we can jump into that, but it was also extremely big for us. And so it was more about quality than it was about quantity.
Lenny (00:37:19):
Awesome. Okay, so one is put out great content. People are like, "Oh, wow. Figma's got some new ideas and maybe I should pay attention." The other is having someone that's that function actually talk to them.
Claire Butler (00:37:28):
Yes. That was when we started accelerating this much, much more is when we brought in that designer advocate to help us with this full-time.
Lenny (00:37:35):
Cool. Okay. Let's move to the next one, which I think is building with your customers.
Claire Butler (00:37:39):
That one, I know you talked to Show, he talked a lot about this, this idea of customer obsession and of building with your customers. And it also goes back to that whole decision that we talked about earlier, about when to come out of stealth. You can only build so much with your customers when you're in stealth, because you don't have that many that know about you. But especially, even in the early days when we only had a couple people, we really did listen. And back to also what you were saying earlier about those steps to product market fit, get one person to use it. That's really what we were focused on, especially in the very, very early days.
(00:38:10):
I remember the first one, I think I've told this story before, but was that we had Coda. They were our first user and they were based in Palo Alto. Dylan and I drove down and demoed the product to them, and they were the first ones. Their designer, Jeremy, was like, "Yes, we'll take this on full-time." And I remember, we were both like, "What? Really? You will?" That was the first person who said yes to us, and so we were so excited. This was a huge milestone. We went to Oren's Hummus in Palo Alto on the way back to the office to bring some back for the team to celebrate. We were just so stoked.
(00:38:41):
And then we got back to the office, and I think Dylan gets a text from Jeremy being like, "Oh, yeah. I tried to share this with Philippe, my engineer, and he can't get the file to open, so I guess he can't use it." And we're like, "What is it? What happened? We finally got someone." And I remember Dylan was like, "Everybody drop everything. We have to fix this." And after some looking at the servers and things, they were like, "Nothing's wrong," and then they realized it was a problem with Philippe's MacBook. Evan [inaudible 00:39:08] had a car, so Dylan had to drive Evan down to Palo Alto to fix the MacBook of Philippe just to get them to use the product. So anyway, get them to stick around. That's the first one.
(00:39:17):
But the building with people, the way that we did that was largely through just each person. We really cared and listened to their feedback, especially when there were only a few people. One way we did that was, I remember we implemented Intercom back in the early days, and there were so few users and so few of us that everybody was on Intercom all day too. And so we'd get a chat and I would jump in sometimes. Dylan would jump in, an engineer would jump in. And he'd open up a chat with people and they'd actually debug the product with us live. They'd be like, "I have this bug," and this engineer would be like, "Let me QA it right now." And so that was one example. We all did support back in that day, and the engineers would talk to users directly, get their feedback, and then go immediately fix things like bugs.
(00:40:02):
And so those are just examples of in the early days, what that looks like, and that just scales a lot over time as you're growing and you're talking to more people. That advocate ended up helping us a ton when they came on board, because some of this stuff, I mean, none of this stuff scales. Your engineers can't do support forever. In the early days, that becomes really important. But when we brought that advocate in, their whole job was talking to users, getting them to try to use the product, but then taking their feedback back when it wasn't something that wasn't working.
(00:40:34):
That helped us scale a lot, so that became really essential, and then telling people, "Oh, we fixed this." It made them feel more ownership of the tool too, being like, "Oh, yeah. I asked them to do this. They did it." That's just another way where you just build a strong relationship with people, because they feel very invested in your journey with you.
Lenny (00:40:54):
Which goes back to building credibility.
Claire Butler (00:40:55):
Absolutely, absolutely.
Lenny (00:40:57):
There's so many important lessons there. You talked about scaling this, but interestingly, this is very much doing things that don't scale; driving to their office, fixing their wifi on their laptop.
Claire Butler (00:41:08):
Early days, nothing scales in the early days. You just have to do it anyway.
Lenny (00:41:10):
Just as a tangent, we're talking about getting people to love your product initially. Why is love so important? That's a really high bar, and I imagine you have an interesting insight on just why it needs to be that level of appreciation.
Claire Butler (00:41:23):
Yeah, and it doesn't have to be over time. These are all things that maybe they just use it first or they're interested, but by the time you're getting to the organization level, or I'm spreading this to my other spheres of influence, like my community, people I know, you're kind of putting yourself on the line. You're taking a risk when you're doing that, especially if it's your job. You're bringing other people in, and you're not going to do that unless you really believe in something. And so just using it isn't enough to get someone over that stage of going from just a user to a champion. And so I think it is this love thing becomes important, because you just don't get the scalability and spread of someone doing this for you unless they have that level of passion.
Lenny (00:42:09):
That's an awesome lesson. I hope people are taking that in. You shared this story of Coda and Sho. Actually, he wasn't on a podcast. He wrote a newsletter and he shared all this stuff.
Claire Butler (00:42:18):
I read it. Yes, yes, yes.
Lenny (00:42:19):
Yeah. People often confuse the two. They assume it's kind of the same thing. But he talked about how when he joined Figma, this happened. Dylan's like, "We need to fix this problem." He's like, "They're not even paying us. Who is this? We have real things to build. Why do we have to hop on this bug?" And then later, he realized why that was so important, and that was a big lesson he learned from Dylan of just this needs to be taken really seriously. If someone's trying to use your product, help them actually be successful.
Claire Butler (00:42:45):
And we didn't have very many of them, but it's like, yeah, back to what you were saying earlier, how do you get one person to actually use it? And so we very much cared that that one person stuck with it and didn't bounce.
Lenny (00:42:55):
Today's episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI-powered features in your audio and video products, then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale.

(00:44:02):
So, coming back to this go-to-market model that we're talking about, we're still talking about get ICs at a company to love you. Step one was build credibility. Step two, I don't know if these are steps or just things you do in some sequence or not, step two is build with your users. What come next?
Claire Butler (00:44:20):
Oh, the next one is, this can take time. I think that's a big one. And also in the early days, they're not going to necessarily use you right away, and so it might take time. And then also, when you do get a couple of people who start to use your product, they're going to also start wondering what other people think about your product. And when you're the only marketing hire, and this is something marketers ask me a lot when they're the only marketer in an organization is, "How do you focus and prioritize, because there's so many things you could do? How do you decide what to do?" And so the thing that I think about a lot in this early phase, in thinking about ICs is, "How do you get to them, and where can you go where they already are as opposed to making them come to you?"
(00:45:00):
Because I'm a firm believer, I think now, we have spaces where people can come to us, but in the early days especially, they're not going to come to your space. They don't know you. They don't care about you. They don't want to go to your Slack channel or something. You have to go to them. And so for us, Dylan really identified immediately that Twitter was the place where that existed, and that had nothing to do with us specifically. The design community existed on Twitter way before we did, and that's something that they just did on their own and that grew over time. They had this large network on Twitter of influencers, and that's also how people learned about things.
(00:45:38):
Also, design's changing all the time, and so people would share best practices, things that they were doing, resources, and that just became kind of a home for designers. So, we really went all in on Twitter. That really became a key, our channel that we focused on, and really only focused on one. That was it, and we got pretty advanced on how we did this. Dylan is also a great engineer, if you don't know that about him, or a scrappy engineer who-
PART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:46:04]
Claire Butler (00:46:00):
A great engineer if you don't know that about him, or a scrappy engineer who could figure things out. And he had this idea and he built this tool or this scraper where he identified a couple influencers in the design community. People he thought were people he wanted to learn from and to talk to. And he inputted them into this scraper thing that he made. And then back to this, another node graph, he figured out who followed them and who followed those people and also the influence that these people had over other people, and made this massive node graph of these pockets of different topics of design. And when he looked at it, you'd see a cluster. So you'd have the cluster of iconographers, graphic designers, product managers, and you'd see them all there and you'd see who the influencers were in those areas. And what we did is we found who were most influential to start.
(00:46:51):
And that was another source, back to using whatever you can to get people to try your products. That's who we asked for feedback in the early days too. Just DMed them. We were like, hey, Raji, we'd love feedback, your feedback on Figma. And that was one of the ways we got to people, but that's also people who we followed, people who we tried to build this connection with on Twitter in the early days. And that's also where we pushed out that technical content that I was talking about. And then we tried to just drive and spur a conversation about these things. First it was our launches, but then later it was this technical content or whatever it was that we were producing so that we could go to people instead of making them come to us just in their feed. And that became super important to us. We'd also interact with people. So Dylan has a huge presence, and especially in the early days and now even has a huge presence talking to users, we all did show too our engineering team. And so it wasn't just the brand handle, it was the people. And I think that that's really important to put a personal face behind things, connect with people, answer questions for people, live there. And over time, we just built this very engaged group of people on Twitter with Figma. And that's still a huge place for us where the design community lives and where we get a lot from our users too. And I think the focus on that, and I think why it's so important is it allows people to passively follow you over time without having to invest in you, within the tool. So it was our way, especially because we knew it would take a while to build a product and get to a place for people to switch full time for them to follow along with us and build that confidence with us over time and keep coming back to the tool.
Lenny (00:48:24):
That Twitter graph story is so legendary. I think Dylan even shared the code online. I'm going to try to find that tweet.
Claire Butler (00:48:30):
Yeah, it's so good. We still use it. We used it again when we were launching another product, we were like, oh, can we go pull that Twitter graph for another audience? I don't know if we ended up using, how much we ended up using it, but I definitely looked at it and I was like, oh, this is so interesting to see for developers or whatever it was that we were looking at.
Lenny (00:48:46):
And also what you just mentioned is really interesting that he wasn't using it to go sell people on the product. It was first get feedback on the product, which ends up selling them.
Claire Butler (00:48:54):
Oh no, we never heard sold the product. It was always about feedback. And I think that that's so key to all of this is all about feedback.
Lenny (00:49:02):
Awesome. There's so many lessons here. There's a fourth bullet I think, around building relationships with users.
Claire Butler (00:49:08):
Oh, just transparency and authenticity. So I think that that really comes into when you get to the scale part, I'm talking about early days, being transparent with your users, and a lot of that does come down to the stuff we talked about too, about downtime, about what that looks like. And we just did that naturally with people one-on-one in those early days. But I think where it gets harder, and we stuck with it because it's in our DNA and how we act, is when you get to scale and you have to still do that stuff with a lot of people who care and who do these things with you. But I think it's just so important that you are honest and also you don't hide behind the brand. That you're human and authentic and transparent with people. And we can pull up the examples. I think the better examples are probably at scale than even in the early days because that's when it gets harder to do that.
Lenny (00:49:52):
So let's chat about that. Just... So this is about getting started.
Claire Butler (00:49:56):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:49:57):
How do you do this at scale? Or does it change completely? Do you continue doing this in a different way? How do you approach it as the company grows?
Claire Butler (00:50:02):
You just totally still do it, right? I think that that's just so important, that's how it stays, right? In the early days you do this stuff and you kind of get the flywheel going. You get these people, you have these people who love you, but today that's still how Figma spreads the most, right? We're going into new markets, we're going into new places, we're launching a new tool, and that becomes so important to how we still drive adoption. And so some of those things, the tactics, look a little bit different, but the themes are still the same and what that looks like at scale. A couple of just examples of that are those advocates, right? That's I think a huge one. When I was a marketer that advocate was just my partner. He gut-checked everything that I did. He'd be like, no, that's too thirsty here.
(00:50:46):
You're using a fluff word again. You know what I mean? Also, he was how we pitched the company. He was the people we talked to, he'd go to lunch at Etsy or whatever and just get feedback on things. And that function has really grown with Figma. So now that's a whole team at Figma, it's a large team and it's scaled with us with every product that we launch. So now we have developer advocates, FigJam advocates, and regionally. So we go into a new region and they're part of the landing team. We're in Japan, we need to find the Japan, now we have two of them, it's the Japan designer advocate because it's just so core to how we do things and we've scaled that. So I think on the credibility side, I think that those advocates and scaling those advocates are the magic dust that, I always call them the magic dust, that make sure that we are able to build those relationships and stay authentic around everything we do.
Lenny (00:51:40):
And these advocates, again, they're just, their background is designer, and then they end up being an advocate designer?
Claire Butler (00:51:45):
It's now developer, FigJam person. But they're passionate that... Their profile is, they're passionate users who oftentimes they find us more than we find them, right? You couldn't just post this job online and go source for it. It's like this will emerge from the community and then they love it so much and they know the product so well. They're technical experts. But yes, they were, for the designer ones, they were all previously product designers.
Lenny (00:52:10):
Awesome. Is there anything else you want to share around at scale, how these things change? You mentioned transparency ends up being really important. What else there do you think is really important?
Claire Butler (00:52:18):
I think there's two examples. The one is building with users. Because I think this is a good one that I like to get into because you're like, how do you scale that? You get so many bug requests, you go to our feature request page on our forum, and it's just so many. But also as you're building product, you're always like, oh, well I could go do all of these fixes and bug updates, but I also have to go build new stuff to grow. And that's always a tension with any company as you're looking at a roadmap. One of the ways that we've done that and still continue to focus on things that people care about that's so related to the craft of quality is through we do quality weeks with engineering.
(00:52:53):
And then we decided a couple years ago, we had this idea where we were like, oh, what if we package all of those quality updates up into one thing and launch them together and we could even show the tweet or the forum request that spurred us to do this. And that was where our idea of little big updates came, which is a launch that we do every year. Figma, they come from these quality weeks with engineering, that's where the engineers can just go and look at Twitter, talk to our support team, get all these small things that annoy people to fix them, and they just fix them all and they get so many done. And then we launch them all together. And that's one of our most popular launches that we do because people are like, yes, I care about this. This improves my quality of life every single day.
(00:53:37):
Back to that discussion of two clicks versus one click and things like that, they're that small, but we still do it. And I love that little big updates when I think, Airbnb did something like that too, with the a hundred updates thing on their website.
Lenny (00:53:49):
Airbnb has shifted fully to that, which is only big launches, just wait twice a year and launch a bunch of stuff. That's exactly, that's fully how they operate.
Claire Butler (00:53:58):
That's another way that we do the building with, and I think that even giving the engineers, we give them the ability to pick them, right? So they're like, oh, yep, this tweet, I want to fix this bug.
Lenny (00:54:07):
That's got to be so satisfying.
Claire Butler (00:54:08):
Yeah, exactly. And in the marketing even, we'll pull examples like, oh yeah, that for one, the person who said that. So that one's big. And then on the transparency side, I think where this gets hard at scale is all of a sudden you have a lot of people who care about your products. And I think it's really easy as a brand because you are a brand at this point, as you're getting bigger to be like, oh, I can hide behind my handle or the Figma handle, or do I really have to say something about this? And so just two examples of things like that where you just, we've chosen to be transparent when we didn't have to be or you might not, or downtime. Downtime is always a big deal. And I remember there was a specific instance, I think it was last year, maybe two years ago, where there was this issue with these servers and an AWS cluster went down and we didn't know what was going on.
(00:55:01):
And so we had downtime multiple times in a week and people were pissed, right? Things were not going well. Again, back on Twitter, we built... The double-edged sword of Twitter is you build this strong communication channel with your users and they communicate right back to you if they're not happy. So it's inundating us. And I remember we did a public postmortem and we always do that. If something happens or something goes wrong, we're like, yeah, that was bad. Here's what happened and here's the technical reason and here's how we fixed it. And then we tweeted that and promoted it and took just full accountability for it. And we always choose to make those choices when they're hard. And that was just one example. But I think the hardest example, and back to your question of the most stressful days at Figma, the true most stressful day Figma, for me, was the day that we announced the acquisition.
(00:55:52):
That was probably one of the harder moments of my career, where... My brand is social, that's my job, is running social. And all of a sudden you have this onslaught on social and you have to figure out what to do. And I remember the way that we announced it was we just retweeted Dylan. That was all that we had said
(00:56:07):
Raji on our team, I remember I was talking to him about it and he was like, "We've got to talk to our users. We just have to talk to them directly. We have to show we're the same company. We just have to not hide behind the brand." And he was totally right. And so I remember we decided that day that the next day we just had to have an open public forum where we could talk directly with our users and let them ask us any questions. And so we'd held the Twitter space the next day with Dylan and Cho and Raji and Tom, and we just had it open and people could ask us anything they wanted and we were able to be just really honest and transparent with them about everything that we could.
(00:56:44):
And I think that that is just a really good example of how even when it's really, really, really, really hard, you still have to just be transparent. And I think that that's when the tide started to turn of people giving us a chance to prove that everything would be great, even when it's the highest stakes and the hardest thing of still listening to people, maintaining that connection and not hiding behind the brand.
Lenny (00:57:06):
It feels like transparency is core to the values of Figma. Have you codified your values and is that one of them and is there anything there?
Claire Butler (00:57:18):
Interesting. We have codified our values. It isn't explicitly listed out, which is interesting, but I think of it as our value, especially with our users. We think about our values a lot as have fun with it, build community, love your craft, and all of those definitely come through, play, but maybe that should be one because I think it's so core to how we make decisions and our framework of when we have a decision which way we're going to go.
Lenny (00:57:43):
And also we mentioned Cho a couple of times, but on Twitter, he is always asking people, what do you need in the editor? Here's what's going great.
Claire Butler (00:57:49):
Absolutely. It's still how we get so much feedback is talking to people directly and Kris will come on when people have bugs and just respond to them. He's our CTO. People are just actively on there, listening to people, fixing bugs, responding.
Lenny (00:58:06):
I want to shift to kind of the second step of the go-to-market motion, but before I do that, I have a couple of things I wanted to touch on briefly. One is you haven't mentioned Config, this conference that you ran, which is a good example I think, of scaling a lot of the things you're talking about. It used to be Twitter, social graph, find people on Twitter. Now it's like this epic conference that I think people just love. I was on Twitter the days of Config, and it's just my whole feed was just like, oh my god, Config is the best thing. So many talks and so many people.
Claire Butler (00:58:34):
Config is such a good example. I remember, I can happily talk about Config. The way that we do Config, I think... I'd never run a conference before, maybe that's probably part of it. And I brought somebody on who had, but she and I were both sitting together and being like, okay, so we're doing a conference. How do we get the content for this conference? What do we do? And we didn't know. And so we just decided, oh, so much of what we do is listen to our users. Let's put out this call for proposals and see what they want to talk about. And so that's how we got and get a lot of our content for the conference. And a lot of it comes back to what I was talking about earlier, which is very technical deep content that targets individual contributors for the practitioners of the tool.
(00:59:20):
And through that process, we build these relationships with these speakers, our advocates help them shape their talks. And then I think that we do produce really strong technical content through that process and through Config. And we're also able to, with these people that we work with, help them grow their own profiles and that also helps them stay more connected to us, helps them become thought leaders in their own right. And so I think we're able to just draw so many different people who are the practitioners and the ICs because we're not just putting thought leadership out there. We're talking directly to how to use the tool and the things that individual contributors are still dealing with.
Lenny (00:59:58):
Yeah, it's kind of a lot like this podcast and my newsletter. It's like how to actually do stuff, not just a bunch of big ideas.
Claire Butler (01:00:03)
Really. Yeah, no fluff.
Lenny (01:00:04):
I remember seeing a tweet about it where someone filmed being inside of and they're like, it's a rock concert, it's not a conference.
Claire Butler (01:00:10):
Oh, that too. We also just have fun. That's another big part of it as well. I remember literally saying, how can I make this more fun? So that was a big part of it.
Lenny (01:00:19):
Sounds like another value.
Claire Butler (01:00:20):
Yes.
Lenny (01:00:21):
Okay. Let's talk about step two of this go-to-market motion that you've developed, which I think if I were to just simply describe it as help people spread it within the organization. Is that right?
Claire Butler (01:00:31):
Yep. Yep.
Lenny (01:00:33):
Cool. All right. How do you do that?
Claire Butler (01:00:34):
All right, so again, I've got four things here and I'll list them out and then we can go through them. The first is make it easy to try the tool and to share it without a lot of gates so that you can do this. The second is those DAs. I want to talk about how those DAs work in our sales process.
Lenny (01:00:50):
Oh, Designer Advocate.
Claire Butler (01:00:51):
Yeah, sorry. That's our acronym for them, designer advocates, because they are so core to how we sell and how this works. The third is finding the operational thing that allows you to scale. For us that's design systems, the thing that was the biggest blocker to somebody using Figma and turning it into your biggest reason to adopt. And then the last one was still about maintaining and growing that connection with those internal champions over time. So those are the four things, and again, it looks different, similar concepts with different ideas when you look at that in the early days versus what we do today with it with scale.
Lenny (01:01:30):
Awesome. Let's get into it.
Claire Butler (01:01:32):
All right, cool. So the first one's making it, the products easy to try and share. So we talked about this a little bit, but if you go to figma.com today, it's very easy to sign up for a free account. I have a free account myself on my personal side for designing my house, which is a thing I used to before, but you just go and you can try the tool. And I think that's so important for us to allow someone to use it over time for a long time until they have confidence enough to be able to want to spread it within their organizations. But then it's also pretty easy to create a free team and share stuff with your organization. In the early days, you could just share a link and that was it, and you could use the tool and everything was free. Once we implemented pricing, which was about two years after we launched, we had this thing called a starter team.
(01:02:21):
And this is actually something that was switched. So initially the way that it worked was our starter team was that you could have unlimited files but only collaborate with two or three people, and that was the starter team and you wanted to add more people to collaborate with, and then you hit the paywall. We realized that wait a minute, that's hurting us. And so we switched it and now it's like you can have something like three files, but unlimited collaborators. And that was huge for us. And that's a place where you can see it in the metrics very clearly, where it's like, oh, this is really easy for people now to share before they have to start paying. This is huge.
(01:03:01):
And so then you get people to start using it for free with their teams and the teams get confidence in it before then they all have to start uploading it to their procurement team or whoever it is to start paying for it. So not introducing payment too fast and giving people that time to build that advocacy and to try it out with their teams, with people before they have to pay, I think is huge there.
Lenny (01:03:24):
That's such a good and important topic that I want to pull a thread on a little bit. So what you discovered there is you don't want to get in the way of the growth engine of the product. If it's going to grow through people spreading it, you don't want to cut it off at three. That seems like a monumental decision that changed everything. Any sense of just how you came about to realizing that? Or was it just obvious, okay, of course we need to change this?
Claire Butler (01:03:45):
Well, I think it was intuitive and it was more about the change management process of how to do that when people... At this point people were using the tool and using that starter tier and setting people or what that looks like. And for a long time you could also get around that and just collaborate with people in drafts and just share a link too. And we wanted to shut that down. So it was a bigger decision on just change management, but I think we intuitively knew it and it was much more about to the change management of how to make that happen.
Lenny (01:04:13):
Is there anything else you learned about what should be in free and paywall versus what should be in freemium? Just broad thoughts.
Claire Butler (01:04:21):
Well, I think the other interesting thing is too, and I think I said this, but so much of ours is, so we have a couple tiers. We have a free tier and then we have a pro tier, and then we have our org tier. And the free tier, free tier includes this free starter team. And so you can just do that, go to figma.com, and go do that. Pro is all enter credit card, and then org is you talk to sales. Org and enterprise, you talk to sales. And so I think the other key thing here is we get a lot of upsells to org from pro. And so it's also a thought of what you put in org versus pro. So that's the other decision because pro is also relatively inexpensive, so that grows a lot too really quickly and it's still very important to us, but still most of our marketing qualified leads that are sales leads likely come from pro or from free.
(01:05:11):
And so it's the decisions that we think about are like, okay, what do you want to sell on? And to go from free to pro, it has to be pretty natural because you don't have any people involved. And so it's like they have to just do that on their own. And then when you go from pro to org or enterprise, it's more about the organization and the scale. And that's where that design systems conversation comes in that we could talk about. But that was the thing that we really indexed on for org and enterprise of why you would want to upgrade from pro to org. So it is this multi-step process, but it's also nice because you can increase your investment in the product as you're building your own confidence in the tool.
Lenny (01:05:51):
The other really important nuance in the way that you structured pricing, it's unlimited viewers, but it's just editors that you charge for.
Claire Butler (01:05:56):
Yes. So true. So many people, especially if you're a designer and you're working with our product manager, you can comment and so much of this is to yes, you can spread it and you can use Figma for free for a really long time because you can just comment on the tool. And it also gets us through many more places with the organization and helps us be more useful to more people because yeah, viewers are free.
Lenny (01:06:21):
This one topic could be a whole podcast. And I have so many questions. Let me ask maybe one more and then I'll move on. How often do you revisit the packaging and pricing at this point? And do you have any advice there?
Claire Butler (01:06:32)
Yeah, I mean it's interesting because the product's still growing. We just launched variables and dev mode back in at Config this year, and that influenced pricing and packaging and still is, right? And so FigJam too. And so I would say the core foundations aren't something we revisit a lot, but we're continually adding new features and we have to think about what tiers should they go in, what does that look like? So those things influence that all the time.
Lenny (01:06:56):
By the way, I recently upgraded to the non-free pack because I hit that limit of three with the designer that I work with.
Claire Butler (01:07:02):
Yeah, it's also just kind of annoying because you have to keep moving things in and out drafts.
Lenny (01:07:06):
That's exactly what it is.
Claire Butler (01:07:07):
It's like, oh, this is worth my $12 a month or whatever, just to not have to bother with it.
Lenny (01:07:11)
Yeah. Once you realize, okay, yeah, it's not that much in the scheme of things, I'm just going to, but it's interesting how it's not that much, but I still like, nah, I don't really want to pay that if I don't have to.
Claire Butler (01:07:20):
Oh, for sure. We all do that. Right? Especially because so much of pro, so many people have individual pro accounts, right? Because not necessarily a business or maybe it's a small business or you're an individual and it's very different from an organization where someone else is paying for it.
Lenny (01:07:33):
Yeah. So funny. Okay, step two is around designer advocates. Talk about that.
Claire Butler (01:07:39):
Yeah, so I just think these DAs, so sorry, I keep calling them DAs because that's what we call them internally.
Lenny (01:07:44)
It's cool. Now we know.
Claire Butler (01:07:45):
Advocates are just so special and such a big part of Figma. And like I said, it took us so long to start charging or bring in a sales team. And when we first hired our first salesperson and our first sales rep was the same day that our next designer advocate started, who... Eventually the first designer advocate left and did something else. And we brought in another designer advocate and he started on the first day that the sales team started. And at this point, more people were using Figma. We'd had that pro tier going for a while, and Tom, who is still here today and is leading that team, Tom Lowry, he was a passionate Figma user, but he was a passionate Figma user who brought Figma to his organization. But the first one, we were so early, he didn't have an organization to bring it to, he just loved the product. But Tom, he brought...
PART 3 OF 4 ENDS [01:09:04]
Claire Butler (01:08:27):
He really didn't have an organization to bring it to. He just loved the product. But Tom, he was the internal champion at his company, who got his company to adopt Figma. So, when he joined Figma, that was really the mindset that he brought to this, was also like, "How do you use this as a team?"
(01:08:42):
And why I think this is so special, and was so foundational that they started together, is that they would go talk to users together, and they would bring him into the sales process. But he was never a salesperson. Never had a quota, doesn't live on the sales team. Technical expert who has such a deep passion, and a deep, deep, deep, deep understanding of the tool, that he would come in and just help explain the product to other designers.
(01:09:08):
And it goes back to that same theme that I talked about earlier with marketing, where I realized that I would never have the credibility with designers that a designer has. Same is true with sales. They're never going to know the product as well as a designer will.
(01:09:21):
So, Tom being there, and Tom being able to be like, "Oh, I understand exactly what you're talking about, and what your problems are. Here's how this works." Or "Here's where you're blocked," or "Here's an idea or best practice how to use this."
(01:09:34):
That just became so powerful and so useful for them and for the sales team, that they ended up calling it the Tom Factor, [inaudible 01:10:15]. So, it wasn't necessarily a structured process at the beginning. They'd just like, "Hey Tom, can you come help talk to this company with us, or help show them how this works?"
(01:09:51):
But then they called him the Tom Factor because he was so powerful, and their deals were so much more likely to close if he joined the calls. But it wasn't his full-time job either. He also is connected to the products. Because he's this special person who was a designer, was a [inaudible 01:10:40] user of the product, and then talks to hundreds of customers. So, he has the best way of synthesizing product feedback, and then bringing it back to the product team because he has all of that context. So, I think that that role is just so special, and it's something that we've actually chosen to scale because it's just so valuable. In the same way it's valuable for marketing, it's valuable for sales.
Lenny (01:10:29):
I think we're going to spur a lot of companies building these teams with this conversation.
Claire Butler (01:10:32):
I can't speak highly enough about it. Marketing, we think about it, as we're scaling this role, we're marketing product and sales. That's where these people come in. And I think when you have a technical IC audience, I don't see how else you could build any credibility or get anywhere with people if you don't have someone who deeply understands it, integrated in marketing and in sales.
Lenny (01:10:52):
Who does this team report to?
Claire Butler (01:10:54):
Me.
Lenny (01:10:55):
Awesome.
Claire Butler (01:10:56):
Yeah.
Lenny (01:10:58):
Okay. So, we're talking about how to help your product spread within an organization. Talked about developer advocates. You talked about making it easier to spread. What else?
Claire Butler (01:11:06):
Let's talk about design systems. Let's say you're a designer and you're designing an app, and you need a button. Rather than going in and making a new button every single time, you need a library of the button ... with the color, the spacing, the padding, all that stuff already predefined.
(01:11:24):
Maybe it's tied to code, maybe it's not. But you just want to pull that in. And then, maybe there's someone on the design system, and maybe there's a brand designer or someone who's like, "Oh, we changed this from this font to that font." That you know that, and it just updates everywhere. Or a padding change, and it updates everywhere.
(01:11:38):
And that's the most simplistic version, is a button. But this stuff gets way more complex. This turns into, "Here is our welcome screen. Here is our header bar." All of the different components that then become whole pages. And it's a huge efficiency.
(01:11:54):
If you have a very robust design system, you're just pulling in all of those components, instead of having to design those from scratch every single time. And it's consistent. If you have hundreds of designers in an organization, they're all making buttons, they're going to be slightly different. And then engineering's like, "Wait. What patenting do I use?" It's very inefficient. So, a lot of organizations use these design systems, and they become very advanced over time. But Figma did not have design systems in the early days. Or if we did, they ended up having them at the file level. But you couldn't share them with other people.
(01:12:25):
So, that was a huge blocker for us for a really long time, was these big companies were like, "Oh, yeah. This is cool, but I need a design system. How else am I supposed to work with engineering?” Because this is so big in engineering, too. Because when you're able to identify all of these different buttons and these components in advance, you could tie them to code. And then it's easier for them because they don't have to inspect it every time. So, it's way better for everybody. It was our biggest blocker. But then we decided, "No, we're going to focus on this." And in the early days, that was just meetups still. And it was like, "We need to do design systems meetups." And we were all like, "What are design systems?" Or that I'm just like, "What is design systems?"
(01:13:03):
And then I went and read a pattern way of thinking and Brad Frost's atomic structures design systems, and started learning about it. But anyway, in the early days, we just literally brought … There's a community of design systems people, and we brought all of them together. Met with our product team, met with Dylan, started just having these really informal meetups around design systems to learn from these people and start just learning, hearing from them. And then they started building out more features from it. And then we just started really leaning into the technical aspects of how companies use and scale design systems. Because, while design systems are so important, it's also very hard to get an organization to do it. Because it's like an efficiency thing that they also have to invest in, that is immediately connected to a launch that day.
(01:13:43):
Every company is at a different phase of maturity of where their design system is. But we really leaned into the content, into the features, into eventually showing how people do it in Figma. Both at the beginning level, but then at the very advanced level, to really lean into that. And then, that also went into marketing. That was ... We have DesignSystems.com, it's a Figma property. We had a whole conference around it in the fall called Schema, where we just bring in these advanced design systems practitioners and they just show you how're they're working. And that's so important, too, because design systems are one of the main reasons you upgrade from pro to org or enterprise, is you're at this phase where you're getting more organized. You're more advanced, you're a bigger company, so that's one of our big gating features for upgrade, so that became just the key thing we leaned in on.
(01:14:30):
And that's bottoms up specific, because the people making the design systems are not like the VP, still. The next phase of bottoms up are the ICs, and then the design systems people. And now those internal champions are largely the design systems people, too. They're either the biggest blockers or the biggest champions, depending on if you can win them over.
Lenny (01:14:51):
I love just that lesson of the thing that is blocking you from being adopted, see if you can turn that into an advantage.
Claire Butler (01:14:57):
Totally. Totally.
Lenny (01:14:58):
Feels like, looking at Figma, it's like, wow, with so many advantages for a product to spread ... It's single player, you can use it on your own. It's got multiplayer, you could invite people. It gets better as more people are using it.
(01:15:09):
Versus, I don't know, a company like Slack, where it's useless on your own. Is there anything there about just, these lessons you're sharing are most helpful for a product that is useful on its own? Or could it be useful for all kinds of products? Anything there?
Claire Butler (01:15:25):
That's what I was talking about with the IC. An IC has to get a lot of value out of this on their own. And I think it has to be technical. Or, that's a hypothesis that I have. It's certainly easier if it's a technical product. They get a lot farther, because people want to talk much more about the product.
(01:15:41):
They care so much about the craft, and they want to spend a lot of time learning and understanding it. And I think that's true with designers, that's true with engineers. That's not true with every audience. Not every audience is ... deeply cares about wanting to learn the craft in the best way possible for a specific thing. So, I think that one of the ... I don't know about requirements, but things that makes this a lot more likely to be successful, is that your IC, there's a tool, and they can use it on their own. And it's technical. I think that helps a ton.
Lenny (01:16:12):
Coming back to the strategy of helping Figma spread within an organization, I think you mentioned there's one more item around champions?
Claire Butler (01:16:20):
Oh, yeah. Just the last thing there is, you have to keep that relationship going with those champions forever. Because they don't go away. And sometimes they get mad at you, too. I remember, there's one. I think it was at one of our companies, one of our bigger companies. And he was upset about something, and he tweeted it.
(01:16:41):
And then we immediately had to go talk to him and understand what he wanted, and what was wrong. They don't go away. But then also, I think a lot about how, through the process of maintaining a relationship with those people, we're actually able to help them, and what they get out of it beyond just the tool. Especially over time, especially as we have a larger platform, I think a lot about how can we help them grow. Whether that's growing their careers. Like they, because they brought on Figma, they get a promotion, or whatever that looks like.
(01:17:11):
But we have more direct control over things like, "Oh, you're going to speak at one of our events. We're going to amplify you on social. We're going to promote you and make you a thought leader.” And it works really well for everyone. Because these people also have the deep technical expertise to show other people, "Here's how I've flip my design systems. Here's how I do this." And [inaudible 01:18:03] people who want to learn from them. And we have the platform to be able to amplify them. So, I think a lot about, "Yeah, how can we help these people grow in their own careers, and get something out of this, too, beyond just the level of the tool?"
Lenny (01:17:42):
And then that builds back into building credibility for Figma, because now there's all these additional designers talking about Figma.
Claire Butler (01:17:48):
Totally. It's all a circle. It's all [inaudible 01:18:23].
Lenny (01:17:49):
Flywheels within flywheels. What a business you've built over there. Maybe just the last question along these lines ... What changes as you scale? A lot of these are things you did early on. What changes as you grow as a company, in this bucket of helping the product spread?
Claire Butler (01:18:02):
Yeah. I think the key thing is that you have to keep doing it. One of the things that I feel like, at my role now at Figma, that I think a lot about, is how I can keep advocating for this stuff when we are starting to implement more top down motion, and having to really prove ROI. Or thinking about, "How do you scale the sales team?" And all those things.
(01:18:24):
So, a lot of what I'm doing, too, is thinking like, "Okay. How do we keep this going and keep this model successful as the company is still growing?" Because it's not necessarily as intuitive as you are starting to add in more of some of these more traditional methods and motions. So, that's something that I think about quite a bit. Things like that conference that I talked about, Schema, that's a big one. Config, that's a big one. Scaling our DA team, and really having them grow with the company across regions and across products, is really big. So, it's how do you keep protecting those things. Because it's not immediately obvious when you bring in just a ton of new people.
Lenny (01:19:03):
Right. It's easy to break the thing that was working.
Claire Butler (01:19:04):
Totally. And you have to do new things, too. You have to layer on new things. But how do you not just walk away from this thing that got you to where you are, as well?
Lenny (01:19:14):
Is this a fit for everyone, this sort of approach? Let's say every B2B SaaS company, what are maybe prerequisites for who should apply this sort of approach and this motion?
Claire Butler (01:19:25):
I thought about this a lot myself, actually. Because Figma also has new products. So, I think to myself, "Oh, can I replicate this?" Like FigJam. FigJam's one of those examples. And Dev Mode, all of a sudden we're working with developers. So, I've thought about this a lot. And I don't know if there's like, "Oh, you have to have this, or you have to have that." But I think there's certainly things that make it easier. And they're both true on the market side, of the type of the audience, and also on the team side.
(01:19:50):
Within the market, I already mentioned it. But I think it really helps if people are technical. And you have this technical audience of people who really care about the craft, and they get a lot of value out of the tool by themselves. Because that just allows them to really learn something and really build confidence in something, before they have to spread it or start collaborating. And it gives you something to talk about with them that's not collaboration. Because, like I said, no one wants to talk about collaboration. Nobody wants to talk about it. So, you have other things you can talk about. Even though collaboration's so important, no one wants to talk about it.
(01:20:19):
So, being technical is important. And caring about your tools, that's another one that I think a lot about. As a marketer, I don't know how much I care about my tools. Some of them I do, but a lot of them I don't. If you're like, "Oh, Claire, you have to move from Dropbox Paper to Google Docs," I'd be like, "Fine." Maybe that's their personality. But designers, specifically, and I think engineers are the same way, just as examples, have deep passions for their tools. Probably because they're in it eight hours a day, so they're using them all the time. So, it certainly helps if you ... These people already care, care deeply, about what their tools are.
(01:20:55):
Another thing that helps is that you have a community that exists within the target audience already. We had that with designers. Yes, we grew it a lot, and have grown with it a lot. But like I said, that Twitter community, that existed without us. That was there before we were there. So, it made it a lot easier for us to get started, because we didn't have to make something to bring people to us. We had a distribution channel already in place that we could work through. That helped a ton. And then I think the last one was that that core IC audience has a lot of connection points within the organization. Designers are so collaborative. Like you were saying, as a PM, you were working with designers. They work with everybody. If you're building something, you need comments, you need feedback. So, it was really natural for them to be a super-spreader, because their role was such that they were collaborating with a lot of people.
Lenny (01:21:44):
And again, when people are hearing this, they're like, "Of course Figma did so well. They had all these advantages." But I think people forget how many disadvantages that also [inaudible 01:22:24]. Like convincing a designer to switch to a new tool ... very hard.
Claire Butler (01:21:54):
One of my favorite stories there is that when we launched Designer News, which was a popular forum back in the day, the first response was, "If this is the future of design, I'm changing careers." Because designers do not want to be collaborative. There was this process where people were like, "Oh, no. I want to do my work on my own, and then present when I'm ready." It was a massive shift in getting them to think in a different way to do this. So even to me, it was intuitive. But of course, you'd be collaborative. But designers did not want to be, all of them, right away.
Lenny (01:22:23):
I think it's only a clearly successful product after the fact, only after the fact. This reminds me of another story [inaudible 01:23:02] shared with me about Uber, which was also very classically not collaborative and very siloed. And there was a big push to adopt Figma to help encourage more sharing, because that was against the culture.
Claire Butler (01:22:40):
Yes, yes. That was a key problem. And it's still a key problem with a lot of design organizations, is that they're siloed. And it's an organizational shift to get people to be collaborative.
Lenny (01:22:50):
What sort of team do you need to have in place to approach growth and go-to-market in this way? What did you find was really important?
Claire Butler (01:22:57):
The most important thing there is that you have an executive and a leader who believes in this. I did not start this; Dylan started this. He was the core person who believed in this, and who drove a lot of this. And he continues to. And he's built this up to be a culture of our team.
(01:23:13):
And since he believes in it, he's able to help bring more people on board and make everyone believe in it. And then, I think the other thing is, through that, is that thing that we were talking about earlier with metrics. I think so much of this is people being like, " That doesn't scale. How do you measure this?” And yes, we are [inaudible 01:24:05]. We are working on all those things. But it's not immediately clear. The metrics don't immediately show you if something's working or not. It goes back to signal over metrics. And I think that that's so important.
(01:23:43)
And having leaders who believe in that, too, who are able to trust their own intuitions and their own guts, is so important. And it's so interesting, too, because I was just thinking when I was ... Just now, that I was talking about earlier about how trusting yourself and trusting intuition is the hardest part, the most stressful part in the early days. But even here, it's the thing you need the most to be successful. So, I don't know how that connects back, but it just feels like that's just so important in this type of model. And with just being at a startup, is that you're able to believe in it, and have the confidence and the trust in yourself.
Lenny (01:24:16):
I'm going to quickly summarize this model just for people to have a very clear, succinct explanation, and then comment on anything I'm forgetting and missing. I'll keep it really brief. And then we'll get to our very exciting lightning round.
(01:24:28)
So, the idea here, basically, is step one, make individual contributors at a company love your product. Step two is get them to help spread you within the company. And to get people to love your product, the four keys that you shared is: Build credibility for your product, build a product with your users, focus where you can connect with your users, one to many. In your case, it was Twitter. And build a relationship with users so that they can start to trust you. And transparency is a big part of that. Before I move on to step two, anything I missed there?
Claire Butler (01:24:56):
Nope, that's it.
Lenny (01:24:57):
Okay, cool. And then step two is help them spread that product within the organization. And what you found was really important there. One is make it easy to share the product and try it for free. Two is designer advocates being involved in the sales process, have the Tom Factor. Find and target the operating thing that spreads adoption. In this case, I think it was design systems, you mentioned mostly. And then the final piece is shine a light on champions, and help them be successful. Make it help them in their career.
Claire Butler (01:25:25):
Yep, that's it.
Lenny (01:25:26):
Awesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?
Claire Butler (01:25:30):
Yes.
Lenny (01:25:32):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?
Claire Butler (01:25:35):
I recommend management books to lots of people. The other piece of this that we didn't touch on at all is scaling a team, and all the things that go into management.
Lenny (01:25:41):
That'll be our next step, our next podcast.
Claire Butler (01:25:44):
Teaching, and also growing new managers. So, Radical Candor and Dare to Lead, to be honest, are the ones I recommend the most. Because I do a lot of [inaudible 01:26:26] coaching new managers and helping them learn how to manage. And those are the first two I start with, because they're so good.
Lenny (01:25:58):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've recently watched and really liked?
Claire Butler (01:26:02):
I just watched 100 Foot Wave on HBO. And I watched it because I'm going to Portugal next week, and that's the place where they have the biggest waves in the world. And it was just really interesting to learn all about this, Nazare and Portugal, and all the waves and the surfing culture that's grown there. That was just a fun one that I watched recently.
Lenny (01:26:21):
And is your plan to do a 100 foot wave?
Claire Butler (01:26:23):
No. Because I am expecting, so there will be no surfing for me.
Lenny (01:26:32):
Oh, wow. Congratulations.
Claire Butler (01:26:28):
Yes, I know. I will be doing yoga on the beach while my partner surfs.
Lenny (01:26:32):
Amazing. We just had a kid. That's a whole other podcast. This podcast, just, parenting starts to come up again and again. It's interesting. Okay, we'll keep going. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?
Claire Butler (01:26:48):
Okay. You might cut this because it's a little promotional, but FigJam. In the last couple of months, especially, I've spent a lot of time having to create strategies and files and explanations, and I've spent in meetings. And I spend all of my day in FigJam, literally, all of my day. And I work with Figma. I use the product. And I was using Figma for a long time. But FigJam for me, in my role, literally use it every single day. And now I cannot imagine living without it. It replaces so many different tools for me.
Lenny (01:27:20):
Great pitch. We will not be cutting that. I'm also a big fan of FigJam.
Claire Butler (01:27:23):
Great. It is true, it's very true. I'm in there all the time. I think I'm the most active FigJam user. [inaudible 01:28:01] validate that in the metrics. But I'm in FigJam all the time.
Lenny (01:27:31):
Next question, what is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, that you share with people? Something that comes up when I ask that.
Claire Butler (01:27:39):
When I was younger, I really was ... I've always been motivated. But like, "Oh, I have to get this thing right now." Whether it was in my career, or I was an athlete growing up. I really wanted to perform and do well in things. And I just put a ton of pressure on myself.
(01:27:53):
But I recently got, or not recently, in the last maybe five years, got this motto of consistent pressure over time as being more of my motto. And taking some of the pressure off of having to do things immediately, or get to a certain place too fast. Maybe it's more of like Atomic Habits, or things like that. But I'm just much more in this mode of like, "You're not going to get everything done. It's a startup. But career, whatever, it's not going to happen immediately." You just have to keep working at it, and not giving up. And having that grit to keep going and keep pushing over time, is way more important than any immediate accomplishments.
Lenny (01:28:26):
That is so good. I just added this question to lightning round and these answers are so good each time. Consistent pressure over time. I so get that. Reminds me of how I think about the newsletter. It's just like, "Keep at it, keep at it. It doesn't have to be the best thing ever, every single time."
Claire Butler (01:28:40):
Just don't give up.
Lenny (01:28:41):
Great answer. Final question, what's your favorite use case of Figma that you never expected?
Claire Butler (01:28:46):
I think I mentioned this a little bit, but I use it for home renovation, FigJam especially. I renovated a house with my partner, and we're doing another one right now. And I couldn't do renovations without it. I copy and paste. I start with Pinterest, get ideas. But then I pull them all to the mood board on FigJam.
[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And then I circle things, and this helps me communicate with my partner. I'll send it to him and get comments from him on stuff, links. So, yes. We also will draw out rooms and model things up, and have them on the iPad. Yep. Interior design and home renovations on FigJam.
Lenny (01:29:23):
Claire, we've talked about making people love your product. I think people will love this episode. Hopefully, they'll also spread it within their organization. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?
Claire Butler (01:29:37):
I guess Twitter. I'm not active, per se, but that's probably ... I don't look at LinkedIn, so Twitter. That'd definitely be the place. Just Claire T. Butler there. And then, helpful to me, you can tell me your feedback on FigJam and Dev Mode. That would be really helpful to me. And then I guess the other thing is parenting tips with work. I'm a little nervous about that. I love my job, love my career. And I'm going to be a mom soon, and need to figure out how to make that work. So, I want to hear how other people have done that.
Lenny (01:30:06):
I can give you two quick tips right now. One is, there's a guest post during my Pat Leave, that Tamara ... I forget her last name, wrote. Which is basically a leave guide, a guide to setting yourself up.
Claire Butler (01:30:16):
Oh, I need this. I'm working on this right now. I need this.
Lenny (01:30:18):
Okay. I will send this to you, and I'll link it in the show notes. Also, right before I went on Pat Leave, I had Noah Weiss on the podcast, who was just leaving Pat Leave.
(01:30:27):
And he gave me this awesome advice of "Don't over-extrapolate every moment." This is less about getting ready for paternal leave, and more just being in it. Which is, "Don't over-extrapolate things that are going on." That one thing that's bothering you or is a problem, is not going to continue, necessarily.
Claire Butler (01:30:43):
Let it go. Good one. I love it.
Lenny (01:30:46):
All right. Well, that's a parenting podcast, a little bit, which is totally cool. Claire, thank you again so much for being here. I'll let you go.
Claire Butler (01:30:55):
Thank you. That was really fun.
Lenny (01:30:56):
That's my KPI for this podcast.
Claire Butler (01:30:59):
Great, great. Great.
Lenny (01:31:00):

# Lessons from scaling Stripe | Claire Hughes Johnson (ex-COO of Stripe)

## Transcript

Claire Hughes Johnson (00:00:00):
What I say to people at Stripe... In our onboarding, I used to run a session. I was like, "If you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you. And I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to like slow the whole company down. Follow a process and get it done, and don't forget to actually make a decision. And if you don't know who the decision maker is and you're worried it's not, you just ask. Don't get stuck." Too many people get stuck and it makes your work terrible, right? What do we all care about? Progress, impact, momentum. If anything I would say about advice to people generally is be a force for positive momentum and it will be actually a real career maker.
Lenny (00:00:50):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Claire Hughes Johnson. Claire was most recently chief operating officer at Stripe for the past seven years, where she helped scale them from a small startup to the legendary company that it is today. Before that, she spent about 10 years at Google where she was VP of self-driving cars, VP of global online sales, director of sales and ops for Gmail, YouTube, Google Apps, and AdWords. Before that, she was in politics. She's also on the board of HubSpot and the Atlantic. And this week, she's releasing an incredible book called Scaling People, which in my opinion should be and likely will be on every founder's bookshelf. In our conversation, we dig into many of the meaty topics that her book covers, including building your operational cadence, defining your company and personal operating principles, your company's operating system.
(00:01:46):
Also, tons of tactical advice around saying things that you cannot say, building self-awareness, distinguishing management from leadership, so much more. I say this a couple times in our conversation. If you enjoyed my newsletter and podcast and the fact that it's very tactical and full of templates and frameworks, you'll love Claire's book, and you'll love learning from Claire. I had such a good time chatting with Claire, and I know you'll learn a lot from this conversation. With that, I bring you Claire Hughes Johnson after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.
(00:02:19):
This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, this sheet tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or are you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies.
(00:04:18):
Use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to vanta.com/lenny. That's vanta.com/lenny to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today.
(00:04:47):
Claire, welcome to the podcast.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:04:49):
Thank you, Lenny.
Lenny (00:04:51):
So you wrote this book. It's called Scaling People. It's coming out this week. I actually read a preview copy, and it's incredible. Everyone listening to this should buy it, especially if you're a fan of this podcast. It's full of frameworks and templates and guides and all these things that I try to do with my newsletter and podcast. And so if you like what I do, you're going to love this book. And I can't imagine how much work it must have taken to write a book like this. So my first question just have relieved are you that you're done with this book and you can move on with your life?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:21):
I am so relieved, Lenny. Writing this book was not my idea. Patrick and John Collison, Stripe's co-founders, really sort of pushed me into it. And I'm glad they did. I will admit that, as I am with most things they pushed me into, but it was a lot more work than I thought it would be, and it's very rewarding to have it done. Of course, though I've been re-looking at it and realizing there are things I want to add information or tweak what I originally said, but maybe we'll have to do a second edition. We'll see.
Lenny (00:05:55):
That's the benefit of a newsletter. I can just edit things and they're immediately live.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:05:59):
Yes.
Lenny (00:06:01):
I want to talk about John and Patrick a little bit. But before that, something I wanted to ask is I find that when I write stuff, I am able to better understand and crystallize my own thinking. And I'm curious, having written this book, what is it that you were able to better understand and crystallize in your own thinking through that process?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:06:20):
It's true, and it's funny, because if you asked me, I would've said I crystallize more by talking and speaking. But whenever I do write something down, I'm glad I did. So I probably do more crystallizing by writing than I would admit, but maybe I'm just lazy and I just like to talk. There's a part of the book, I think it's toward the end of the third chapter, which is about hiring, and that's a really long chapter. Turns out I had a lot to say about hiring and hiring leaders and processes and what you need want to set up. And as I got toward the end of the chapter, I found myself saying to the reader... You maybe have read this and thought, is she for real? You need to do all this work? You need to put all of this in? And I had to say, well, look... I started the chapter saying, if you believe that talent is everything, then your hiring process is everything.
(00:07:11):
And so yes, you do need to put that work in. But I think, Lenny, to your point, when you see all the templates and the frameworks and the examples and the advice from my career... And I was at Google for almost 11 years, I joined Google when it was about 1800 people pre IPO and left when it was about 60,000. I had eight different jobs while I was there. And then joining Stripe when it was about 160 people, and now we're over 7,000 people. Yeah, I have a lot of examples, but really what's crystallized is how much work it is to build, to build a company. You know this. And I hope this book is a bit of a shortcut, but there are no shortcuts. I hope it will accelerate people's knowledge so that they can get down to work with our product and with our customers.
Lenny (00:07:58):
There's a story you share at the end of the book, I think it's in acknowledgements, about how people went and took John Collison out for dinner and were just picking his brain, and "How did you scale Stripe? How did you build this amazing machine of a company?" And he often came back from these dinners, and he's just like, "Claire, they just want to talk to you. You did all these things, not me." And it sounds like that kind of encouraged you to write things down, and then led to this book. One, is that true? And then two, I'm curious, what else did you learn from John and Patrick Collison that have stuck with you? I imagine there's a lot, but kind of what stands out?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:08:31):
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think it is true that at Stripe, we're fortunate where we have so many users, customers who are themselves founders or interesting companies growing up around the world, whether at scale like Amazon or scaling. I've spent time with Discord and Toast and all kinds of interesting companies that are growing up around us. And a lot of their questions are not necessarily about Stripe's products always. They're really about, "Well, how do you guys do this thing?" Or "We're having this challenge. Are you having this challenge?" And John, yeah, would often come back from trips. He would travel more, and he is often probably meets with more customers than anyone in the Stripe leadership team, maybe other than our sales leaders. And they would ask about scaling, and he would joke. He's like, "We need Claire in a box." So I think the book is Claire in a box, I guess.
(00:09:23):
But Patrick also would have that same experience. And when I contributed a chapter to Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook, even though if you look at High Growth Handbook, which I also really do recommend not just because I'm in it, I'm probably the least, I don't know, celebrity participant in his chapters, and my chapter got a lot of traction because I think it was very specific. It was very tactical. And Elad actually helped me to realize, look, examples and details and frameworks, my working with Claire document is in there, is like... He said it's catnip. And I think that is also what inspired Patrick to push me to do basically a longer version of that chapter that I did with Elad. But I've learned a lot from both of them. I used to think that I was... My parents are teachers, Lenny. I used to think I was very curious, and I'm a learner and I'll seek out information.
(00:10:21):
And I grew up in a very educatory environment, right? Well, once I met the Collisons, the two of them are huge sponges, seeking out knowledge constantly. But also, anytime we were confronted with anything, even things I felt I'd done before, that I had the experience and we were going to build it, they were like, "Well, who have you talked to?" Or "What have you read?" And it was really good. I don't think I made enough phone calls in my earlier career and asked people's advice and asked for help and found the person who did that thing five years ago and found out what they learned. And I think that's probably my biggest lesson from working with both of them, is how much it pays to seek out knowledge from others because we're all just learning all the time.
Lenny (00:11:11):
Is there a story or example of that comes to mind that was really beneficial where you actually ended up follow that advice and reached out to someone, talked to someone, and that changed the way you think, changed the way you operate?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:11:21):
There are two things that just jumped into my mind. The first one is early on at Stripe... When I joined, we were about 160 people. I started bringing in some leaders. We were building out go to market, we were starting to stabilize our support operations, building out recruiting and HR, all the things. We were really growing. And it became very apparent that we needed to put in some kind of job structure. Levels and ladders is what you would call it, which is there are different levels of pay, and they have to do with your experience and your impact and their expectations of those different levels, right? There's an engineering ladder. And this stuff is probably making some people listening like their skin start to crawl because it's never fun or easy to define all that, and it's not perfect. You're immediately getting into something that feels pretty suboptimal, but it is worse to have nothing because it starts to feel very unfair in the environment, especially if you have to start to change up compensation and reward or reward systems, right?
(00:12:24):
So I realized, oh my gosh, we're going to have to put this in place. We didn't know HR people, so I basically ran a project. And the first thing I did though, thanks to Patrick and John, is I talked to Square, I talked to Airbnb, and I talked to two or three other companies. But those two conversations, I'm not going to say who said this, but one of them, the person said, "Oh, that's a blood bath." They were not encouraging about what we were about to go through. And another one said, "You know what? I'm so impressed that you're doing that so early. We waited too long." And actually, that's what a lot of my book. It's about is when should you start to think about this thing that you might need, right? And it's sooner than you think. And so putting in levels of ladders felt like ripping the off, honestly, but I was glad. One company I talked to waited until they were like 800 people, and it was apparently not fun because people don't like to be... Who likes to be categorized?
Lenny (00:13:26):
Yeah, and put it at a level that maybe they're not happy with, right? They're like, "Oh, I thought I was a lot more senior than that."
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:13:32):
Yep. Yeah, exactly. It's not easy. It's a form of change challenging. And I would not say we did it perfectly, but I'm glad we did it. I think that example was definitely one of them. Another was like we were really... We wanted to roll out 24/7 support in multiple channels, email, phone, chat in multiple languages and getting from where we were to where we wanted to be as quickly as possible. Not many companies have done at the scale, because Stripe has millions of customers. We're B2B, but we're B2B at a very high scale, which actually Google was as well. And so that was beneficial to me coming into the Stripe environment because I'd done parts of that for Google. And again, that's an example of something I thought I knew how to do, sort of, but we certainly didn't do it perfectly, and it's certainly different when you're talking about payments.
(00:14:24):
That's people's money. That is a business'... If they don't know how to contact you and they have a problem, that is a huge issue. And so I did seek out a lot of advice. And I would say... Did anything change dramatically what we did? I think if anything, the advice pushed me to go faster on some of my intuitions about, for example, using vendors and outsourcing parts of the model. And I realized we're not going to scale all this internally, especially not at the speed that we're going, but it's hard to start to use outside sort of contractors if you haven't filled figured out all your tools and processes. So that balance was sort of freaking me out, but you just got to push through it.
Lenny (00:15:15):
There's a couple directions I want to go, but I'll go in an unexpected direction. At Stripe, you're kind of infamous for your titles. When I created this career ladder document.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:24):
[inaudible 00:15:24].
Lenny (00:15:24):
Yeah, it's like everyone's product manager., They're like a VP of product potential and it's like product manager. What's the rationale behind that? I guess, and what's the benefit of that? But, we don't have to go too far down the road. I'm just curious.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:15:37):
So this is something that Patrick and I actually really agreed on without a lot of discussion, which is not always the case. It has to do with a combination of optionality as you scale and grow, and also culture, right? And so the minute you start titling a lot, you're signaling hierarchy and authority. And the culture piece to Stripe still today, which is I think we could use more, at least more overt trappings of structure because it can get confusing. And I'll be the first to tell you that, and I admit that this might have carried on too far. But early on, at Stripe, there's a real belief. It's not a particularly hierarchical company. And if you're the person who has the knowledge, you are the expert on the thing, you better be, one, in the room helping make the decision, and two, driving, helping to drive the decision. And I don't care how senior you are, right? And that was the cultural signal that was important, which was about mutual ownership, and also expertise not sitting in hierarchy.
(00:16:43):
And then the optionality thing is probably a little more obvious, which is don't make somebody the CMO, or even the head of marketing, if you're marketing team is two people, right? Yeah, you might make the right choice, but two years later, your marketing team's probably going to be more than two people, say it's 20. And are you going to have to layer somebody or have too many titles? And then someone feels like they're losing something, right? It goes back to the levels and ladder saying, but it's worse because you've given something, and then you're sort of taking it away, and that's just not... Organizationally, you want more flexibility. Honestly, I'll say my final thing, which is I have a little bit of a knit where you meet a company. I get what's happened, which is in order to hire this person, they had to sort of say, "I'll make you the VP of sales or the VP of this," but the company's like 25 people and there's seven VPs.
(00:17:40):
If you're a customer or you're evaluating it, you're kind of like, "Really?" It's a little incongruous with the scale. So we kind of more flexible. We had a lot of growth, head of this or growth lead. I know you're all about growth, Lenny. Well, we definitely took growth and find that very broadly. But the other thing I've said to people internally... Sorry, you can really get me going on this one. I bet you didn't think that. If you are a stripe and you're going out into the market, actually it speaks to the same thing, which is you're going and trying to sell to a customer who's a lot bigger than you. I'm not saying make up a title. Don't say you're the VP of sales, but you can be creative about how you represent your scope because you probably have really big scope because you're one of the only people helping to sell the product. And that will help you because a lot of more established mature companies are trying to do that hierarchy match, where "Well, bring your SVP because my SVP is coming to the meeting."
(00:18:42):
And we could be like, we don't really have that. It just gives you a little more selling flexibility too.
Lenny (00:18:48):
I like that. I like combo where you can just say something that fits in this situation, even though that's not your technical title.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:18:53):
Yes, you can say, "Oh yeah, I actually am in charge of optimization for our payments product." I'm sure you are. I'm sure that's what you
Lenny (00:19:01):
Do. Coming back to something you talked about with the career ladder, and I had a question around this, you talked about how oftentimes people do it too late, and I'm curious why it's so important to think about the stuff that you wrote about in this book so early in your company's life cycle. I think in the book you mentioned that it's oftentimes as important to get your operational structure and cultural structures in place incorrect as finding product market fit or finding your first few customers, which I think would surprised a lot of people. Can you talk about why you found that to be so important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:19:35):
Not only can I talk about it, I wrote a whole book about it, so let's try to restrain me. But here's what I would say. Obviously product market fit is the most important. And what I do say in the book is focus on that and don't get too far. My book is definitely not zero to one. It's more like maybe 0.5 to 1.5 or one to two. Because I do think when you're smaller and focused on product market fit and finding your user and getting that traction, that shapes a lot of how you work and your goals and who you hire, and that all makes sense. I think the thing that happens though is, one, some companies don't quite realize they're hitting it and they start to get behind on actually building the company part. Because guess what?
(00:20:23):
It turns out product market fit is just the product, and that is not a company, and that will not scale, to point. You see these companies that sort of fall over and there's sort of a bad article about them, and often it's not the product, it's the fact that they didn't actually build the company very well, and that started to harm, in fact harm the product and harm the mission. You have this vision, you're going to solve this problem with this product. And all of a sudden you can't solve it because you didn't scale the org properly. You didn't keep the cultural fabric strong as you grew, right? And so that's why I think it's so important. And so let's say you are hitting traction, and hopefully you do notice it. Because I think a lot of founders, you're kind of paranoid.
(00:21:08):
Like Stripe, I don't think Patrick and John fully embraced that they needed to start scaling maybe until I showed up, and that was part of hiring me. I was like, yeah, this is it. It's happening. It's not just look at the numbers. It's like look at the inbound support demand, look at the inbound sales leads. I just did the math, and I was like, this company should be probably twice the number of people it is right now, which of course freaked everybody out, but it was very obvious to me because I was coming in outside with that perspective. But more importantly, not just scaling things like sales and support... And as you probably know, if you work in payments, you've got a lot of other functions that are very important around risk and compliance and you name it, or the machine learning models and that help you do those things.
(00:21:55):
But for the sort of structures and operating processes that I talk about in the book, I do have this analogy which I think you picked up on to building a house, which is you have the supporting beam. Say it's a post and beam structure. You need the posts and the beams, and then you're going to have to do the mechanicals, right? There's going to have to be some amount of wiring in order for you. I don't know if you have your solar panels, but you got to bring in the heat, you got to bring in the cooling and plumbing, and then you have foundational stuff that you have to build or the whole structure will fall over. And I think of putting in the posts and beams and the mechanicals and the foundation as actually essential to scale. Because if you do those things well, you build them in such a way. This is almost like a Russian doll kind of thing, but you build them so that they're replicable, right?
(00:22:49):
So the way that you do goals as a company can start at the company level, and this is how OKRs were so beautiful for Google and they can replicate down to the individual. And the same common structure allows that to happen at really different levels of scale. And that's what you're looking for, is what are these common things? We do not a lot of them, by the way. You don't want to mandate a lot, you don't want to put too much structure in place, but enough that everyone can play with it up and down what I would think of as the stack of the company. And if you don't start putting those things in early, people will just invent those things. And then you'll have... Picture a house that got added on to 17 times and it's not even two years old. It looks not super stable. And then you're going to find yourself having to do a tear down, which I think we've all seen companies do that.
Lenny (00:23:40):
I definitely want to get into that house structure and all the components of it. But before we get there, if you're a early stage founder just looking for product market fit, maybe the skipping ahead a little bit, but which elements do you think are the most important that they need to do now? Because they're going to read your book, which gives them so much advice on all the things you can do.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:01):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:24:02):
If you have to pick a couple things that you have to nail when you're just starting out before product market fit, what do you think is most important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:24:08):
I think really that early, keeping it very simple and being focused on that goal of product market, which is like what is the problem you're trying to solve? What's your vision?Everything you have to do for an investor pitch deck matters not just for the investors. By the way, people forget this. A lot of the story you tell to investors, early ones especially is the story you should be telling internally to anybody you hire. Why do we exist? What problem are we trying to solve? What early customers have we attracted, and what's their feedback. That's what you mostly need, but you need to remember to share it and don't just use it for fundraising, or don't just use it for a board meeting or an investor meeting. Use it internally. And I think you can get pretty far actually with that core content. As you start to...
(00:24:56):
The first thing you're probably putting in place is a little bit of hiring process, and I think that's going to matter sooner than you think. Don't just be tempted to hire people in your friends. Think about what you need, what capabilities you need to build even pre PMF, right? And so as I said, there's a chapter about that, but I think some of the simplest versions of it is how do we evaluate talent? What kind of talent are we looking for? Where do we go look for talent, figure that out, and sort of train people a bit internally on interviewing. I think interviewing is not a skill that comes naturally. People think it does. It does not. And there's really basic easy tips and tricks you can find even on the interwebs about interviewing. And I really recommend... And my book has examples of rubrics, questions you can use. How do you really get at... Because it's hard to really evaluate someone in 30 minutes or 45 minutes.
(00:25:49):
So I think interviewing some of your fun fundamental early investor kind of content you need. But then when you start to get some traction, then you're showing to codify and actually document what I call more foundational content. Because if you're pre-product market fit, you're probably small enough that you just can tell everybody all the things. You don't have to send them the packet or have them sit in the onboarding. But the minute that you're starting to get any kind of hiring speed, you're going to want to document it more and you're going to want to start to put some very lightweight processes of how you get things done in place, because again, you're trying to replicate velocity. It's easy when you're all in one room and everyone knows like, "Oh, this is the most important thing to get done today," hack, hack and hacking away. But then pretty quickly, that is not going to be the case.
Lenny (00:26:38):
I definitely want to go one layer deeper on that, but there's this area I wanted to get to before we dive into some of the weeds around that, which is I found it really interesting that you started your book with this idea of personal operating principles versus here's how the company should work. It starts with here's how you should think about yourself. So I want to go... There's four of them... But before I get into them, can you just describe what is the idea of a personal operating principle and why is that important?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:27:02):
Remember the book is about two things, company building and company structures, and all that, replicating all that good step and management. So the other thing that the book is really about is management tactical guides to... It would be easy to build companies if there weren't humans involved, right? But there's humans and they're complicated, and I'm complicated and you're complicated. And there are things that motivate us. There are things that demotivate us. They're not the same things, though Lenny and I, I think you and I have some things in common, but point is the book starts with you. And I think a lot of people think management starts with the team, or even the company. And actually, I think founders make this mistake. Founders think, well, it starts with my product. And yeah, but it actually starts with you. And so the book starts with sort of my belief system, which is self-awareness, which is the first operating principle. Self-awareness to build mutual awareness is actually the most fundamental thing you need to crack if you're going to succeed at company building or management, in my opinion.
(00:28:08):
But I would say I'm one of those people who has strong opinions that are pretty loosely held. This one is a strong opinion strongly held, which is the more that you can seek feedback, seek to understand your motivators, your strengths, your blind spots, your tendencies, and take that on board and expose it to others, you're going to be a much more effective company builder and manager. So it starts with you. And those operating principles that I articulate are sort of mine, but they're also foundational to the content of the whole book. I do think authentic leaders tend to have their own, right? Lenny, you probably have a few that you... You maybe have not articulated them all out loud, but I do have mine and they're in the book, but I think you would also find that some of them you could adopt. If you were looking for were some to start to use as a leader, I would hope that I've put forward a couple that might be useful.
Lenny (00:29:04):
I want to talk about these four, but while you're on that topic, what are ways to help crystallize your own operating principles? What advice would you give people to do this? Because to your point, people probably have them in their head, but they haven't really written them out.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:29:17):
That's right, they haven't. The book has an exercise that I recommend in it that's a little bit more about crystallizing your personal values, but that's kind of the place you want to start. And it's essentially there's a whole menu, and you can find these online, of say 70 or 80 different values. And by values, I mean family, ambition, impact competition. People value education. People value different things differently, by the way. And there's no judgment. You might value being a very competitive person and I might value collaboration above competitiveness, and that's fine. We probably would both be very effective in a team for different reasons, right? So basically if you take a list of values and you say, okay, if I had to pick 10 of these that matter to me, then if I had to pick five of them, and then you really force yourself if I had to only pick three of them...
(00:30:09):
And it's actually good to have this in a dialogue with someone that you work with or well, and you sort of had to explain, well, why? Why, when I'm really pushed, do I have to hold on to say education or learning as a value? Or why do I have to hold on to integrity as a value? And I tell a story in the book about a manager I worked with where transparency was a very important value to him. And the thing is you usually have a story behind that value, right? And in the book, I use the name Eli for him. Eli ends up sharing this story at this offsite that we had. And the transparency value actually was a little bit problematic to manage because Eli would tell everyone everything, including his team, even when we weren't finished with the plan, right? But Eli got up and told a story of being younger, like seven or eight, and realizing his mother was very sick, and no one really told him what was going on.
(00:31:07):
And then unfortunately watching the process of her dying and then being taken out to lunch by his stepfather and told, "Your mother is gone." And okay, well, your whole worldview kind of explodes when you hear that, and you're like, oh, okay, this transparency thing is really real. This was a formative experience for him and it has changed how he operates, and it will probably have changed it for his whole life. And if you can get to that point on your own, of telling yourself, what was the story? What was the thing that made this so important to me? Then you're starting to be in a mode of self-discovery and then you're starting to document, okay, if these are my three top values, and here's why. And then I think what you want to look for are my, what I would call my work style tendencies? And so you get your values, and then you sort of go on a... I'm sorry, I could go on about [inaudible 00:32:08]. I warned you. I wrote a book about this.
(00:32:09):
But basically, all these work style assessments, Myers-Briggs, DISC, Enneagram, you name it. And by the way, I would take all of them because I find that very good. I mean some of it's just data. You're just taking on data. But a lot of them come down to are you introverted or extroverted? Are you more introverted or extroverted? Where are you on that continuum? And are you more task, if you kind of picture a horizontal and a vertical, are you more task or people oriented? And so I would take your values, and then I would plot yourself. Am I a more extroverted task-oriented person, which means you're kind of a director, get what done kind of person? Or am I a more extroverted people-oriented person, which might mean actually you're probably great at being very charismatic and building some followership and maybe selling a vision? A lot of salespeople are very extroverted people oriented people.
(00:33:03):
And then you start to see, okay, if this is my sort of tendency in my default and this is my value system, what are the ways that I operate that really make up who I am and becomes almost a belief system. And my operating principles in the book, one is to build self-awareness, to build mutual awareness. Another one is say the thing you think you cannot say. I think that I've come to believe that often your biggest strength, one, is also your weakness, but two, is something that you don't know is a big strength because it's almost like breathing. For me, saying something actually fairly openly and directly but in a non-threatening way is a thing I do. John Collison actually once said to me, he's like, "It's so interesting when you give feedback, that can be actually pretty brutal, I leave feeling really optimistic."
(00:34:02):
But I don't mean to be brutal, but I think I can sort of unpack and say this thing, like here's my observation, here's going on, and it's not judgmental, it's not threatening, it's actually opening up an opportunity for people. So say the thing you think you cannot say. You would actually find that more of us can do that. And then I come back to distinguish between being a leader and a manager, which is something early in my career, I did not do well, Lenny.
Lenny (00:34:30):
Before we get to that one actually, just to briefly ask you a follow up question, because I love that you're getting through all four here. This is great. But I was going to ask, is there something.. So clearly, you're really good at saying the thing you cannot say, and I love that. Many people are not good at this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:30):
No.
Lenny (00:34:45):
Do you have any tactical advice for someone that is not good at this for how to actually say something uncomfortable?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:34:51):
I think the main thing is, and Fred Kaufman has this in his book, Conscious Business, this concept of a left hand... He calls it the left hand column, which is you're in a dialogue with me or you're watching a meeting happen, and you've got a running commentary in your head. And honestly, some of that stuff is pretty harsh, right? You do not want to open your mouth and just say that thing. But what Fred says is, learn how to detoxify the left-hand column. I would say think about a way to say that thing that you think you can't say. You've filtered yourself out, which I don't like. And I want you to think, okay, can I? And I think that the... Here are the tricks, a couple of them. One is, ask a question.Right? A question is not threatening. By the way, the question could even be, is there something we're not talking about? It feels like to me... And then you own.
(00:35:47):
So the next trick is you own it. This is your observation, this is your perception. This is not a judgment. I am not saying, "Lenny, I think you really botched that interview." That's not useful. If I said, "Lenny, you know what? I wonder if you missed an opportunity in that interview. Did you feel like you missed an area that..." And then you're kind of curious. You're like, "What do you mean?" And I'm like, "Well, I'm kind of looking at this with you, and I'm standing next to you and I'm observing it." Right? That's less threatening. So one, ask a question. Two, make an observation that you own. So if I said, "I feel like there's something we're not talking about, and I wonder..." Oh, I own it. "I wonder if it's the fact that these two teams both seem to have the exact same project."
(00:36:32):
I talk in the book about a meeting I was in where it was very clear that we had two teams in conflict, and no one was saying the thing that was really pretty bad. I was like, this is pretty bad. We have two teams that seem like they both own a piece of work and are in conflict with one another. But I would say if you do those two things, ask a question, own the observation yourself, don't pass a judgment, you will get way farther than you would've ever thought sharing. And by the way, that sharing, one, there's probably other people who just haven't, can't get it out of their head, and you have ar opened up a door that a lot of others can probably walk through. You're not alone.
Lenny (00:37:12):
You have this framework, I think you call it being explorer, not a lecturer. Is that what you just described? Is that how you describe it?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:37:18):
It is. And to me, what I just talked about was more of a meeting or a conversation scenario, but I think that this... I'm glad you brought that up. I think this is actually a very fundamental management framework of mine, which is in a one-to-one interaction, your job as the manager... First of all, too many people think your job as the manager is to be the expert and tell people what to do. No, actually, your job is to enable people to be their very damn best on your team. And you have to create an environment and a context and provide them information, and then you need to provide them a form of coaching. Now, again, I think people start think coaching is lecturing, like let me coach you how to make this Excel model. And sometimes they do. Sometimes someone comes to you and says, "Can you exactly show me how to do this thing?"
(00:38:05):
Fine. But most of management is actually exploring with someone. It is being curious. It is saying, "I have seen this pattern of your work. Have you seen this pattern? Is there something..." I have a whole other framework which is about hypothesis based coaching. I think intuition as a word gets kind of a bad rap, and I kind of get why, look, especially if you work with a lot of engineers, which I do. It's not particularly always data driven, but guess what a scientific hypothesis is? It's a well-informed piece of intuition. And I think too many managers wait until they have a million pieces of data to make an observation to someone about an area for improvement. Instead, I would say take some data, form a hypothesis, and then explore it with the person. Because if you're well intended, which I think any good manager is, I'm bringing up this thing because I'm trying to help you see it and tell me if it's true so that we can both help make it more effective, better.
(00:39:11):
One very light example could be, "I felt like in that meeting... How did you feel that presentation went?" And the person sort of says, "It's fine. I think I got through the material." You say, "Yeah, I felt like you were maybe a little bit nervous. I'm just exploring. Were you..." And by the way, the person could say, "Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no." And then you could back off, or you could say, "Oh, well, maybe it was just me, but I noticed some physical. Your leg was shaking a little bit, your voice, you were kind of repeating yourself." And they're going like, "What?" And you're all you're doing is holding up a mirror... And you have to own it. You have to say, "My experience of you in that meeting was that you seemed nervous to me. Maybe you were not, but actually maybe this is just a physical coaching thing."
(00:40:04):
Have you ever had that? I have a few people on my teams who do this weird thing. This is pre virtual world, but when they're sort of getting it uncomfortable in a meeting, they put back their chair up off the table, sort of exit the circle. And that is a very physically big statement. And they had no idea, Lenny. They had no idea. I'm just watching the meeting, and I'm like, oh my gosh, you're like four feet from the rest of the group because you do not like this topic. And what I need to explore with you is how do you vocalize that instead of physically exiting the room or exiting the circle? These are just examples. Sorry, I could keep going. But I really think that that attitude of exploration and mutual sort of collaborative, let's discover some things about you...
(00:40:54):
And by the way, it can be mutual. They can go right back at you and say, "Well, I observe this." Great. Great. I've interviewed a lot of people for the book, different leaders and managers from lots of different fields, but one of them was Reid Hoffman, who's a more typical. But Reid, we were talking about the other operating principle, which is management versus leadership. And Reid was pretty honest. He's like, "Look, I'm more of a leader. I'm not a manager." He's like, "I'm not a great manager." And then he told me the story. He's like, he had in his first company that he was building, he had a guy that he'd hired who was more operational. And Reid was sort of making an observation to him about something they should do, and the guy goes to him, "Reid, I wouldn't hire you to manage McDonald's."
(00:41:42):
And Reid was like, "Okay, good. So tell me what we need to do so we can fix this thing." But what actually Reid's operating principle, interestingly when unearthed that whole thing, was that he prides... It's very important to him to create an environment of open feedback. He said, what I love about that story, yeah, it's funny and embarrassing, but actually that guy was comfortable saying to me, "I wouldn't trust you to manage a McDonald." And I think that actually I found inspiring because I don't think everybody who founded a company or who's managing someone has created an environment with how much trust in it, right? And that's how Reid thinks he gets a lot of stuff done, is people just come right back at him with the feedback.

(00:43:19):
So we've done three of the operating principles that you personally use, which I love. I love that you're going to going through [inaudible 00:43:25]
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:24):
Distinguish management and leadership is the third one, yep.
Lenny (00:43:28):
And then just to summarize real quick, the second one was to say the thing that you cannot say. The first one was-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:34):
Say the thing you think you cannot say, yeah.
Lenny (00:43:36):
And then first, build self-awareness to build mutual awareness.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:39):
Yeah.
Lenny (00:43:41):
And what's cool is you're sharing all these amazing stories and tactics. In the book, you actually have templates to do each of these things for yourself. So a lot of this is pointers too. If you actually want to do this, go check out the book and you can actually do this. It's not just in a bunch of high level stuff. And then the fourth is-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:43:57):
Come back to the operating system.
Lenny (00:44:01):
Let's talk about it.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:44:02):
So this one is, sort of like I was talking about, touchstone documents that you might create for your company. This is our operating principles, our values. This is my touchstone, which is I think that especially high growth environments, but every environment you operate in can get really chaotic, and there's a lot of ambiguity. There's a lot of stuff you don't know, and it's kind of easy to get paralyzed or to sort of give into the chaos. And you're like, oh my gosh, I don't know what this day is going to bring. I'm just going to randomly assign some stuff, and I'm just going to get through it. And all you're doing in a lot of those moments is creating more chaos. And I think a really important role of definitely managers, but some leaders too is to create a stability when there doesn't feel like there's a lot that's stable.
(00:44:52):
And where stability comes from is in ritual and in common practices that you share. So we set quarterly goals or monthly goals. And that's a ritual, and that's a thing we do, and it's actually a source of stability. And yeah, it feels like a process. It might feel like a way of managing, but it also has a cadence to it. And I think one of the things that happened is you picture yourself sort of spinning out of control. You think, how do I come back to this is the order I do things, this is how I get decisions made, this is how we make plans, this is how we make decisions. Those touchstones are not processes to run the thing. If they're done well, they're stabilizing because they're a common way of approaching that everybody has, so they can at least hold onto that even when all the other stuff is going haywire.
(00:45:45):
You've got a customer churning, and you've got a big launch happening the next day, like, oh my God, oh my God. Come back. What's our launch? How do we launch products? We have a way of doing that. We do not need to spin out of control and reinvent the wheel here, right? And that's a stabilizing thing. And the other thing on come back to the operating system for me was, as my career scaled, as I went from a individual contributor, to managing a small team, to managing a bigger team, to managing multiple teams, to managing managers, you get it, I realized actually, and I started to have multiple functions. So I was context switching between... At Google, there was a point where I had some product people, industrial design operations, really BD, really different functions. Actually, how I fundamentally ran them at the bare bones, at the house architecture level was the same.
(00:46:38):
And that gave me a stability as a leader where I would dive into a meeting. I'd be like, all right, let's look at the metrics that matter. We all had... We had them for every team. Let's look at the goals we set. And that also helps you stabilize when your contact switching between seven different projects or seven different teams. And so I wouldn't say it's the operating principle that I talk about the most, but I think if you were like, "What's your sort of... How do you scale yourself?" I would say, "Well, I actually have a common operating system like a computer, and that is how I maintain a sense of stability."
Lenny (00:47:17):
Perfect segue to the next kind of broad area I want to spend time on, which is this house metaphor and the three components of it that you talked about. And this is like the core of the book. Can you talk about again, the three kind of pillars of this house structure? And then let's just go through each of these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:47:33):
Yeah, it's definitely, the beginning of the book is about company building, and the company structure chapter is all about the sort of supporting beams, the mechanicals, and then the foundational stuff. And interestingly, it's sort of, well, I guess when you build a house, you build the foundation first. So one is the founding documents that you might create, which I'm happy to talk about. And then another are the supporting structures, which are some of the ways you do things we talked, like quarterly business reviews or OKRs, or how you use planning to create a structure that everyone... And then the mechanicals are what I might call the operating cadence, which is essentially the rhythm of how you work, right? The calendar, the year that we all experience tends to dictate a little bit how we work. Mondays feel different than Sundays, right? Well, companies have that same kind of a cadence, which is often also calendar driven, but also can be event driven.
(00:48:28):
We've talked often at Stripe about how our customer event, which we have called Stripe Sessions, is as important internally as it is for the customers because it's a forcing function for our cadence, how we plan our products, what we want to have achieved by that point, what we want to demonstrate. And that's true for a lot of companies, but we actually use it in our thinking about our cadence of the year. And actually, we've built this other event that I usually help run, which is an internal event that happens generally about six months before that, which is great because you can demo the stuff you think you want to demo internally. You sort of create a cadence of we're going to push ourselves to do some crazy wild stuff, internally demonstrate it, and then see if we can externalize it by the time we hit the customer event.
(00:49:16):
But that is a cadence. Quarterly business reviews are part of your cadence, et cetera. So that's the fundamental, but really while I'm trying to do is say, one, I don't think this stuff is super hard. You know this. It's kind of hard work. It's just putting it in place, and then actually using it. I think where a lot of leadership teams go wrong, especially of young companies, is they experiment with different vehicles to try this stuff. And then they either don't actually follow them or they throw them out the window after they haven't tried it for very long, and it creates a lot of chaos. So I would say do very few things consistently and try to do them well, and then see if they're working for you, and then once a year, maybe think about a revision. But don't keep throwing out new things you heard that other companies do. And it turns into a weird grab bag of operating stuff. You're nodding because you've seen this too lot.
Lenny (00:50:16):
Yeah, I think a problem I've seen is people think there's going to be this perfect system and process that's going to not have any flaws, and they're always like, "Oh, it's not perfect. We got to optimize it further." And what I find is it's always just like, this is the best one you can come up with at the time. This is the best idea you have now. There's going to be flaws. Just work around those flaws. But just know there's never going to be the one thing that works.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:50:35):
There is no one. There's no perfect org structure, there's no perfect operating approach, there's no perfect, yeah, performance and management and level system. But having one and committing to it is good. And don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Lenny (00:50:50):
There's another, you mentioned that I thought it'd be fun to talk about, that it's often chaotic at a company. I imagine people think about Stripe from the outset, like, oh, they've got it all figured out, so smooth, just runs like a machine. And I think people look at other successful companies and they're like, man, things are so crazy at our company. This isn't normal. But I think, you tell me if I'm wrong, most places are crazy and chaotic internally for a long time and often, right?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:51:15):
Yeah. There are different kinds of chaos, but it's so true. What is that? There's like a saying. Don't ever believe your best press or your worst press. It's never as bad as whatever someone's saying it is never as good. It's just normal is not pretty. It's a lot. And that is true. It's happening everywhere. I used to have a friend who was building a company. We would see each other. We both were from the Boston area, and it's a long story, but we'd end up on the same flight off in Rhode Island, coming back to Boston occasionally for stuff, for family. And we'd be in getting yelled at by the passengers because we'd be in the aisle of the airplane comparing notes about stuff that was broken.
(00:52:02):
And we had this expression, it was like, oh, and then I picked up the rock, and under that rock were some really ugly, creepy crawlies. But that's just like the way it is, is it's never perfect. But I guess I would go back to what I just said about having some stabilizing ways of doing things because that can create, I don't know, I'm not trying for a perception that the thing runs a machine, but more of a, that is a well run thing, right? And how do you create that perception? Because you adhere to some ways of running things and that are consistent, and it feels better even to the outside, even if there's a lot of chaotic stuff going on.
Lenny (00:52:45):
Coming back to the founding documents, could you just talk about what are in this group of founding documents? And I think even more interestingly, what's a sign that you should invest more time in this area as a startup?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:52:55):
Yeah. Very classic stuff is in here, nothing that you haven't seen or examples of. So one is I think it's good to have a mission. When I joined Stripe, we did not. It came to be apparent that to increase the GDP of the internet was probably the mission, because people kept repeating that back to us, and Patrick had written it on some website copy early on. But it was interesting that candidates and customers kind of grabbed it. It was very Stripe because it's a little bit intellectual and pointy headed and aspirational, but also it is... The GDP does involve economic progress, which we're all about, right? We're building infrastructure for commerce and payments for not just the internet actually. But anyway, point is have a mission, or at least the beginning of what's your one line of what you're seeking to accomplish.
(00:53:47):
And then I'm a big fan of writing sort of what we Stripe called our long-term goals, which were just not our short distance, but our longer distance, like why did we exist? And so the mission is one line, so you need a little more meat behind that, right? And actually, I think if you looked at our long-term goals, which by the way I thought would be a three to five year goal, I would say they're still relevant today. But one of Stripe's long term goals is to advance the state of the art and developer tools, which would not be something that everybody, especially every customer of would initially call out. But when you think about it... Lenny, you just did it. You think about it for a minute, you're like, yeah, the API and the docs and a lot of stuff that we've open sourced, Stripe cares.
(00:54:38):
Our forever user is fundamentally a developer. It's the person who's integrating Stripe, right? By the way, simple integration, complex integration, anywhere in between, we really care about their experience, and we care that the tools are excellent, because how are you going to increase the GDP of the internet if you don't advance the state of the art of developer tools? Right? Anyway, point is articulating that, because until I said that to you and I could talk about it with you and say you came to work at Stripe, you might not understand why we invested in certain things or why it meant so much to us in terms of our user experience and the mission. So articulate those things. And some of them might be a little bit aspirational, but they should feel at least real enough that you can have that conversation about... You look at anyone who works in a company, what they choose to do all day with their time should be guided by things like, what are we trying to accomplish?
(00:55:35):
What are our long-term goals? So if they don't know them, how are they going to make the right choices? So that's one. And then another is a lot of companies write company values, or at Stripe, we wrote operating principles. I think you had [inaudible 00:55:50] on, and she talked about these, and we even sort of took a version of ours and put them out for candidates so that they could evaluate, do I want to join this company, because I kind of want to know what it's like to work there? And I think that's really valuable to do because not every company is right for every candidate, and the more you can mutually match the better. But having some operating principles matters. I think you can go farther than that, but that's where I would sort of start, is those three things.
Lenny (00:56:17):
Awesome, I like the simplicity of this.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:21):
How you know is people are asking you. Especially new hires are asking you a lot of questions about what's important, or "Why do we do it this way?" You said it yourself at the beginning. Doesn't writing something down, crystallize it? Time to write it down and crystallize it for everybody who works there.
Lenny (00:56:40):
And just to summarize you as a mission, your operating principle/values. What was the third one?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:45):
Yep. Long-term goals.
Lenny (00:56:47):
Long-term goals.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:56:48):
And sort of more details on why you exist. What are you really trying to accomplish?
Lenny (00:56:52):
Interesting. And then are those numbers in your experience, or is that a story of what [inaudible 00:56:57]?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:00):
Those are a little bit more, I think headlines. And I think your shorter term goals have numbers against them, right? So if you looked at your long-term goal, which might be... Another one of Stripe's is about accelerating globalization, and if you thought about what would that require, that would require us to be in a lot of markets. That would require us to have users and customers in a lot of market, and also to eliminate friction across borders. So those things, which is a very high friction thing, unfortunately in payments, and moving money, which it shouldn't be if you want to advance globalization, accelerate it, right? And so that can then become numerical goals and short term goals.
Lenny (00:57:41):
Basically objectives, and then-
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:57:43):
Yeah, it's sort of the longer term objective, and then the key results part is early is shorter term. But actually, if you're having trouble writing your company goals, actually zooming way out and being like, "If we're going to meet this mission, what do we have to accomplish in the long term?" You can then walk back from that and be like, "Oh yeah, every goal we ever have probably fits in these three to five buckets." Bam. And then you write your short term goals actually more easily because there's always going to be one about, say, international expansion. There's always going to be one about additional products because we're trying to do X, and you can't do it with one product, or whatever. You can imagine the example.
Lenny (00:58:22):
Awesome. And I know your book has a actual examples of a lot of this stuff.
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:25):
It does. It does.
Lenny (00:58:26):
So again, pointer to that. Okay, so that's the founding documents. The next piece is operating system. Maybe we go there, just what fits into an operating system for a company? What are the components of that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (00:58:38):
I think a lot of the components we've sort of touched on, which is do you have some sort of goals? This is now goes back what we were just talking about. For Stripe, we have an annual set of numeric targets that we put together, we have a system of goals or OKRs, objectives and key results, but sort of like what is your structure for setting milestones that you want to achieve, whether they're numeric or more like a binary, we got this thing launched, we didn't? And then QBR, so quarterly business reviews. How do we review parts of the business? What is the cadence? Well, first, what is the form by which we do that? Which would be this... I share examples in the book of this might be the template you fill out if you're a team and your reporting on how it's going and versus your strategy and your goal.
(00:59:24):
And then there's also getting into metrics and dashboards. What are things that you look at internally to measure progress, the input metrics and the output metrics? And I give some examples of that. And then mostly, I think there are other... As I said, there could be less frequent forms you use, like a user event or a launch, a way of launching products, et cetera, but it's really simple. It's mostly goals and how do you review the business. Planning. I talk a lot about planning, which is. You said this earlier, and you and I think both agree, which is there's no perfect process to plan for the next year or the next two years, but you still need to fight your way through having something, especially after a certain stage. And every COO I meet with, we sort of ring our hands together.
(01:00:11):
We're like, oh, planning and everyone hates us, too burdensome, but you still got to keep trying. You got to do it. And so we talk about planning processes and what they might look like and how you set them up. And then that's how you'd use goals and QBR to measure against the plan, right? So those are some of the operating systems. And then the cadence is just how often do you do these things? Actually, one of our big lessons, I think companies that are moving quickly and that are younger tend to resist some of the calendar based cadences of more mature companies because they seem slow. You're like, really? You're going to just achieve that goal in three months? Or are you artificially restricting yourself to some lowest common denominator of time? And so I get that fear, and I would say your cadence doesn't have to be one quarter or one six month, or even 12 months.
(01:01:08):
Stripe, we did sort of six month processes for a while. So instead of a year, we did it in six months. Still, there were things that took, by the way, a year or longer, but I think that play around with the timeframe and don't feel restricted by what other companies do. But one of our lessons on the QBR was sometimes those quarterly, because that stands for quarterly, those quarterly business reviews were too infrequent, especially for new product areas. They we're still in development. They were still getting a lot of feedback, launching a lot. And so we just said, okay, they're not quarterly anymore. They're like every six week business reviews. Fine, change your cadence. The point is to have one, because then it's predictable for teams. They know what they're marching toward, they know when they're going to be reporting out, and they can set their goals in a way that makes sense to make progress in that timeframe.
Lenny (01:02:02):
One quick question there. What's a sign that your cadence is off? What's a flag that we should go shorter or longer?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:02:10):
Well, everyone usually complains about these things, but I think if the... One, nothing, like you said, it's probably too fast if not enough progress is being made in between whatever your review or your reporting function is, and it's probably too slow if the content you're reviewing seems stale. And you're like, "Well, we knew this," or "We already did that thing," or "Yeah, we already had the meeting where we talked about that." That's another thing that's interesting, is some companies will have a pretty frequent metrics review cadence, and then an infrequent strategy review cadence. And what happens is the metrics review becomes the strategy review because you're not talking about the strategy often enough. And so you're talking about it through the data, and so then by the time you get to the strategy review, you're like, we already had this meeting. And that's just a sign that some things are just off. And to me, it's about timeliness and freshness of the content, but also that there's actually new content. If there's not new content, you're creating work for people. By the way, give them time to work.
(01:03:12):
And so I think don't fool yourself that thinking, having more frequent checks on things is going to actually make things run faster. I would say that the opposite can be true. And so be very wary of actually slowing velocity down by creating overhead. One thing we try to do at Stripe is if we're looking at metrics, let's just look at your dashboard live. Let's not create a special presentation. I actually just share your screen please on your dashboard, right? Which is a good discipline, because one, that means you have to have a really good dashboard that's real time, that's web accessible. No one had to pull or massage the data. That's a good sign. But it's also, you're not wasting people's time prepping all that information, which happened even... By the way, at Stripe, even when we put that in place, we still ended up with versions of that problem.
Lenny (01:04:04):
Yeah, [inaudible 01:04:05] I think mentioned that. I think there's a term for it, data something, where you randomly get chosen every week and someone has to present your data.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:04):
The metrics review meeting, yes.
Lenny (01:04:10):
And it's like the next day, you're going to have to share your meetings and [inaudible 01:04:12]
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:12):
Yes. We called it the spin the wheel, the spin wheel on who gets to present. But that has a logic in it, which is then you're not working. So just prepare it.
Lenny (01:04:26):
Right. That's awesome. I love that policy. There's so much more I want to chat about. There's chapters on hiring, self-development, personal development, all these things.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:34):
Team development. Yep.
Lenny (01:04:36):
What was that?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:36):
There's a, yeah, intentional. There's a team building.
Lenny (01:04:40):
Team building.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:40):
And performance management.
Lenny (01:04:41):
Yeah. Okay, so we could go through all that stuff. Instead, I want to talk about the COO role broadly.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:47):
Yes.
Lenny (01:04:48):
I asked on Twitter, preparing for this chat, what people wanted me to ask you about it. And most of the questions ended up being about the COO role and things like that. So I just have a few questions lined up here for you.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:04:48):
Sure.
Lenny (01:04:58):
Okay. So Amir [inaudible 01:05:04], with little accent at the end there, he asked just at what point do companies need a COO, and how would you judge if someone is a fantastic COO?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:05:12):
Oh yeah. Well, I would first say most companies, if you looked at the universe of all companies, do not have a COO. I think it's fewer than 20%. It's definitely fewer than 30. And I think that's something to know, that I don't think it's an automatic role to have or hire. And I think you see it in more prevalently in earlier stage or high growth companies. You also, by the way, see it in certain business models. I actually think Apple was an interesting version of this, where Steve Jobs was oriented in terms of product and design, but also that Apple has... It's very intense to manufacture software and hardware that then works together. I learned that when I worked on self-driving cars at Google, and you need a very intensely operational, detailed manufacturing, hit the marks, hit the timelines person. So I think some businesses that have a very deeply operational, say a manufacturing component, that role might be more prevalent.
(01:06:19):
But point is, it's not an automatic. I think it's useful in a high growth... In an environment where you're having... Think about the founder/CEO of a company that is achieving product market fit and also having to build a company, and hire all the leaders. That is a lot because you are building the product and the business, you are building the company, and you are building all the people, bringing them all in. And that is where I think a COO type of role can give you leverage, which is... Essentially, it's a layer that takes some of those functions and helps build them with you and on your behalf, and also in some cases, bring some experience in maybe there's a particular function like go to market that needs to be built. And I think that's where you see it come up. What I've said to some people recently is I'm a little worried, just like there's a mythical founder, that there's some mythical silver bullet COO hire that everyone's like, "I will just find that person."
(01:07:20):
And first of all, we're all human beings. I'm not perfect. I certainly did some things well when I joined Stripe, and other things not as well, and I'm working on my self-awareness of what those things are. But I would say one lower risk strategy could be to bring in, say, a head of business operations or a role that's sort of COO like and try a couple of functions with someone and see if they scale with the company and with the role, and then maybe you decide they're a COO. I mean, I mentioned Stripe's business operations team. You could hire a business ops leader and sort of say, "Hey, build this team to help be the Swiss Army knife to help scale the company, and then maybe that turns into more." Or there's some CFOs that are quite operational. They could take on more scope sometimes.
(01:08:11):
But I think there are other paths to getting that leverage, and there are also ways to de-risk the hire because you could end up searching forever, right? And I worry that it's become too much of a panacea in people's minds, like somehow they're going to find... And people will call me, and they'll be like, "I just need to find you." And I'm like, "One, I may not be right for your company, but two, that was a lot of work, and I think we actually, in the end, maybe got pretty lucky." How would you know someone is fantastic? Someone said something very smart to me, which was... I was in a meeting. It was me and Patrick. So Patrick is the co-founder and CEO of Stripe. And they said that having just the right amount of tension in our relationship was how you knew it was working for the company.
(01:09:03):
And it gave us both a little bit of pause, but we ended up having quite a good conversation after that meeting, which is there has to be mutual understanding and trust and an ability for Patrick to say, "Hey, can you go do this thing?" And then believing, I will do it at the level of quality and intensity and intentionality that he would like. But there also has to be some friction, where I would maybe say, "No, I'm not going to prioritize that. I don't think that's important for the company," or I'm going to give you feedback that I don't think we're doing this well, or he's giving me feedback. The customer experience is suffering. All your scale stuff is degrading this thing, right? So fantastic is not all hunky dory. Fantastic COO is just the right amount of friction intention with forward momentum and mutual trust, because then the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, right? That's what you're looking for.
Lenny (01:10:03):
I was actually going to say, I've worked with some founders, and they have this concept that they hire a COO, and they would just solve all these cultural issues they're having these relationship issues. And sounds like that's exactly what you're saying, is that that is not often the solution to some of these deeper issues.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:10:18):
Well, that would be the other problem, is actually believing... I was getting recruited, Lenny, and people would... Essentially, I felt like the founders were saying to me, "I'm going to give you all of the things I don't like doing as your job." And I was like, even if I'm by the way not qualify to do all those things, number one. And two is sometimes that list would be quite long, and that would make me nervous. I was like, "Do you really not running a company actually? Is that what's going on here?" And really, I think they weren't confronting elements of their work that needed to evolve and change. And what I loved about joining Stripe was... I think people also think, "I'm just going to hand all this stuff to this person and..." I'd love to say I took all this off of the Collisons plate, and Billy and John and the other people who were there at the time, and no, we actually were more collaboratively worked together, and I think it helped...
(01:11:18):
Well, one, you don't feel as isolated because you're in a team, but also there's more joint work than people realize, I think at least in the companies I'd like to work for.
Lenny (01:11:30):
For the final 10-ish minutes we have together, and you have to run-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:33):
Yes.
Lenny (01:11:34):
... I was thinking I could go through just a rapid fire set of tactical questions and see maybe one piece of advice you would share with someone that's maybe struggling with this thing.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:11:44):
Okay.
Lenny (01:11:45):
And the first is from a also Twitter person, Manuel [inaudible 01:11:52]. And he just had a question around, as you're scaling, keeping alignment strong is challenging. What would be something you'd recommend to someone that's scaling quickly and trying to keep people aligned?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:02):
Well, a lot of what we talked about, having common codified documents of what we believe in, how we work, and then using communication practices very intelligently. Never think that one communication, meaning an email or an all hands, reaches the audience. You have to be smart about how you communicate.
Lenny (01:12:23):
Awesome. Amazing. On a different podcast, we talked about how the leaders are often the repeater in chief, just having to repeat the same thing again and again.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:30):
Yes. And just like a marketer, use different channels. Some people read emails, some people watch videos, some people attend the meeting. Repeat.
Lenny (01:12:40):
Love it. That'll be our clip to take away from this. I was watching an interview with you, and you talked about the value of offsites for creating cohesion within a team. Can you just talk about why offsites are so important to a company and a team?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:12:53):
I think offsite is really a vehicle. The concept is the following, which is when you yank people out of their day-to-day routine, you create space, and also you imprint memory. And so if you say, "We're going to do a very different thing with your time today or the next two days, we're not going to do our emails, we're not going to do our regular meetings, we are going to sit and work together, we're going to brainstorm," you're basically activating new parts of their brain, and then you're also having a group experience that cements a belief system usually, or a set of plans. And it also helps bring people along. We formed this thing together, it's not effective if I say, "I locked myself in a room for three hours, and then I came out and here's the plan." You want to lock yourselves as a group, as a team in a room for three hours. How do you do that? And so that's why I think it's valuable. It's just out of time, in a way. You're taking it out of your day-to-day time, and I can't not found a good substitute for that.
Lenny (01:13:56):
On a different topic, one of the most common questions I get from product managers and just founders that I haven't tackled yet, and I'm curious what your take is, is around just keeping the company updated on what's happening broadly.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:14:07):
Yes.
Lenny (01:14:07):
What have you found works for just keeping people informed on what's happening across the company and-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:14:12):
Having really smart communication practices is something that I think a lot of companies don't invest in early, and it's partly because it feels like extraneous, but it's a lot of time. If you're going to communicate well, you have to invest in your intranet site and what's on it. Ideally, everyone logs in and sees information on the homepage of your company internally. Do you have a newsletter? Do you have founders do like a message or a quick video, whether that's on Slack or email. There's a lot of smart tools. You can learn a lot from social media in some ways, but you actually need a strategy for it, and you need a set of people who help make sure it happens so that again, it creates stability and cadence. And if I want to find information about X, this is where I go. And I think there's also that if you do it well, it can replicate down to teams, which is, oh, we have our weekly snippet stock that everybody can see the important news or whatever it is.
(01:15:09):
But you need to create those things because they'll start to spring up, but then you'll have a million of them, and you won't be able to point people to the core messages. But it is not a thing to be taken lightly. And I think having someone who really not focuses on internal marketing, I'm talking about just good, "Here's what's important. Here's what you need to know." Sales teams actually do this really well, because they have to, because they have to keep the sellers up to date on the product and up to date on how to pitch it. And so it actually is worth talking to smart sort of sales leaders who've scaled and saying, what do you do that keeps everyone on the same page
Lenny (01:15:48):
As you're talking, I realized [inaudible 01:15:49], who we mentioned a couple times, she left Retool, and she's working at a startup that has trying to solve this problem, I think it's called. It
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:15:56):
Is a lot about what they're working on. And it's because it is, again, an unsung thing that is critical and that I don't think people naturally come to.
Lenny (01:16:03):
Next question, what are one to two, or maybe three things that people can do to run more effective meetings? I say give this masterclass on running more effective meetings. And just to boil down, what are a couple things people could probably change?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:16:16):
I do have a video on YouTube about running an effective meeting, but I think the number one thing is the work of a meeting is not calling the meeting. Calling a meeting is easy. In fact, that is a problem. The barrier is very low, and it should be higher. What you really want to know... People need to know why are we meeting, and what is the point, what's the objective of this meeting? Is it to make a decision? Is it to share information? Who needs to be here? One of my favorite things to say is make the thing that's implicit explicit. Too many meetings are implicitly about something and not explicit enough. And I'm like, "No, no, no. I want to know why I'm here. Are we making the decision? Who's making the decision? And how?" Even better, you say, "Does anyone not need to be here? Because we'll just send you a note afterwards about what happened? Right? Make it more efficient, but be really explicit about the point of the meeting, and really do some inquiry on whether it's important, whether it's needed.
Lenny (01:17:17):
Maybe a final question is around decision making. So product managers who are, a lot of the audience of this podcast, have to, one, make a lot of decisions, get people to alignment, but they also don't classically have authority over anyone. What advice do you have for aligning and decision making?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:34):
I love product management, so much accountability. So little authority. Such a hard job.
Lenny (01:17:39):
What a fun [inaudible 01:17:41].
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:41):
Everyone's like, "I want to be a product manager." I'm like, man, that is one of the hardest jobs in tech.
Lenny (01:17:45):
Yeah.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:46):
But anyway, how do you get people to a decision?
Lenny (01:17:48):
Yeah.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:17:50):
Actually, it's exactly... And I mentioned in my book, Gokul's SPADE Framework, which you can look up. He has a coda on it. But actually, it's the same thing that I said about meetings, which is making it very explicit, that there is a decision to be made, who is making the decision, the criteria by which the decision's going to be made, who will be informed. There's all these models. There's racy and radar, and there's a million different decision models. Just pick one, make it explicit, explain that's what's happening, and get people through it. Follow the model and do it. And by the way, you can always have an asterisk, which is if we want to revisit this decision, this is what we do. But I think too many teams get paralyzed because they're afraid, like, well, maybe they're not the decision maker, or maybe... When I say to people at Stripe in our onboarding, I used to run a session, I was like, if you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you, and I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to slow the whole company down.
(01:18:52):
But really, I think the other thing is, in the book, I talk about this framework that Bezos uses, type one, type two decisions. Is it high impact? Is it irreversible? Is it not? Really evaluate, what kind of decision is this? How hard is it? And then follow a process and get it done. And don't forget to actually make a decision. And if you don't know who the decision maker is and you're worried it's not you, just ask. Don't get stuck. Too many people get stuck, and it makes your work terrible, right? What do we all care about? Progress, impact, momentum. If anything I would say about advice to people generally is be a force for positive momentum, and it will be actually a real career maker.
Lenny (01:19:41):
I love that. Maybe we'll make that the title of this interview. With that, Claire, I know you have to run. Anyone listening, you got to buy this book. Like I've said at the beginning, if you like my newsletter, it's exactly my newsletter, but as a book about operations.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:19:54):
Thank you. Scaling People.
Lenny (01:19:56):
Scaling People. Is there a website they can go to to check it out on Amazon, or is there-
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:00):
They can go to press.stripe.com/scaling-people.
Lenny (01:20:00):
Amazing.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:06):
Or Amazon. Just search scaling people on Amazon.
Lenny (01:20:08):
Cool.
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:09):
But thank you, Lenny. I appreciate it.
Lenny (01:20:12):
Absolutely. Just two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to maybe ask you questions, follow up, reach out? And then two, any other way people can be helpful to you, other than maybe pre-ordering the book?
Claire Hughes Johnson (01:20:20):
Well, definitely pre-ordering the book and giving me feedback on that. I guess Twitter is probably the best place to find me. I'm @chughesjohnson on Twitter. But honestly, I do hope you'll consume the book in some form and interact with it because the goal is to make it useful. We talked about this, Lenny, your podcast for my book is just trying to be of use, and I hope it is a positive force for positive momentum. And I really appreciate the opportunity.
Lenny (01:20:49):
Absolutely. Thanks for making time for this.

# Bending the universe in your favor | Claire Vo (LaunchDarkly, Color, Optimizely, ChatPRD)

## Transcript

Claire Vo (00:00:00):
People often think that I get hired into later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company, and in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup.

Lenny (00:00:11):
Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:00:16):
I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster. If you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half.

Lenny (00:00:24):
There may be a trend happening here of combining engineering product.

Claire Vo (00:00:27):
I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design speed. What is best for the organization?

Lenny (00:00:38):
You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there.

Claire Vo (00:00:44):
Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably.

Lenny (00:00:56):
Today, my guest is Claire Vo. Claire is a longtime chief product officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. She's also been a two-time founder, engineer, designer, and a marketer. She's also the creator of ChatPRD, which I suspect is the most used PM-specific AI product out there, which she builds on nights and weekends.

(00:01:19):
In our conversation, we dig into what PM skills AI will complement and potentially replace in the future, the story behind ChatPRD, and Claire's advice for how to stay ahead of the curve on AI within the PM role, the importance of feeling agency over your career, and how to bend the arc of the universe to achieve the things that you want to achieve, insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an exec, how she creates a fast pace within larger companies while also keeping the bar very high, the rise of the CPTO role, combining product and engineering under one leader plus a ton of career advice both for early career people and senior leaders, and so much more.

(00:02:01):
This episode has something for anyone that's in product or interested in the role of product, and I'm very excited to bring it to you.

(00:04:16):
Claire, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Claire Vo (00:04:20):
Oh, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I'm even more excited. You're someone that, to me, has always felt inevitable would be on this podcast and that we'd be doing an episode together. Do you feel the same way, or not? And it's okay if you don't.

Claire Vo (00:04:32):
It's a privilege and a pleasure, and I'm glad I'm here. I've been so impressed with your guests and your content. It's been so exciting to see just the wide range of product leaders and thinkers in this space. And if I can be on a list of product leaders and thinkers in this space, then I'm doing something good. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:51):
It's absolutely my pleasure.

(00:04:53):
I want to start by talking about career advice. I was perusing your LinkedIn, and your career path is basically what most PMs probably dream of in their career. Just to summarize, you went from associate product manager to product manager to senior product manager to director to senior director to VP to SVP to chief product officer, and now you've been chief product officer of three different companies. And along the way, you're a founder, you're a designer, you're an engineer.

(00:05:22):
Here's my question. If you had to boil down what you think your secret sauce has been to progressing so far and so quickly throughout your PM career, what might that be?

Claire Vo (00:05:33):
Yeah, so when you list it all out, you can probably guess underneath it all is a relentlessly curious, impatient, eager to build person at their core. I just like building stuff and I find a lot of fun, and I think if you find a career or a craft that's fun, it's easy to accelerate your growth in that career. One thing, I just love what I do.

(00:05:56):
But when it comes to career growth and that progression from, I actually started as a copywriter of all things, copywriter all the way up to a CPO or CPTO that runs an engineering organization, it boils down to something really simple, which is know what you want out of your career, be clear and ask for it, and then make it easy for your boss or whoever can support or champion you to get you from here to there.

(00:06:20):
And so I'll take a really specific example from earlier in my career, where I had been in management for design and product management, so a senior manager level over product and design at an e-commerce company, and worked very closely with growth and marketing. We were just two sides of the same coin and worked very closely. And the head of marketing left and there was this big to-do pretty quickly of, "Well, what are we going to do with marketing? And do we need to hire somebody?"

(00:06:49):
And I sat for about a half a day and I thought, I think I can help here, drew out an org chart, put my name on the top, walked into my boss's office and said, "This is one potential solve of your marketing organization question, is we'll bring product and marketing growth together. I can be in this position. Here's how I'd change the management structure underneath this. Not just where do you put me, but where do you put everybody else? And I think this could work for the company, and this is how I'd suggest we roll it out and this would be my JD." And I got that job. I think when people ask me about career advice, they want to hear, "What can I do?" Really, what do you want? And how do you make it as easy as possible to make the case to your boss to get you here to there?

(00:07:33):
The other thing that I give people advice about is know what you want out of your current role and know exactly what you want your next role to be. And I even know this, and I even say this to my boss. When I was VP of product at Optimizely, I said to my boss, "I want to be a chief product officer. Here's how I'm going to get us here to there, and I want you to partner with me on it." And even coming into this role when I was interviewing at LaunchDarkly, my boss, Dan, the CEO of LaunchDarkly asked me, "What do you want out of this role?" And I said, "I want my next role to be a CEO role, so I want this role to fill in my gaps, learn, help me elevate my experience to get me to that next step."

(00:08:14):
And so I always know what that next role is going to be and I'm always clear about it. Now, I think there's a fine balance here. There's one thing to be very clear about your goals. It's another to suck the oxygen out of the air about only talking about getting promoted. These are probably 0.005% of my interactions with my boss are about my career growth and my path. It's very small. "Am I clear? Are we on the same page? And am I communicating as I'm making progress against those goals?"

(00:08:44):
High-slip people I think get promoted basically as fast as the org can support. I've almost never wished I promoted somebody earlier. I've seen managers or folks promote a little too early, and so as somebody that's managing their own career, you have to be a balance of ambitious and assertive and take care of yourself and advocate for yourself, and the work needs to speak for itself at the end of the day, and that's what's going to drive for your career growth. And so know what you want but do the work and produce the results, and you can have a career like mine.

Lenny (00:09:24):
Maybe first to summarize, some of the core advice you're sharing is know what you actually want because you're not going to progress towards this amazing future career if you don't actually know where you're going. Otherwise, you'll be pushed in directions that you're not necessarily interested in going.

(00:09:38):
I have a sense of where you want to go to tell people and ask for it. "Here's what I want to be doing in the future. Help me get there." And I love the other point you made of just, don't over-focus on that. There's many people that spend a lot of their energy on, "I need to get promoted. How do I get to the next level? I deserve the next level." And I guess maybe along those lines, is there any other advice you could share of just how to avoid being that person that's just constantly obsessed with promotion? Any more advice of just how to find that balance?

Claire Vo (00:10:06):
Yeah. One, you've got to lock to the norms, the talent norms of your organization. You should know how those things work, and they can work very casually if you're a very small startup and they can work more formally if you're at a very large company. And one, understanding how promotions operationally happen inside an organization can help you have those conversations at the right time in the right moment with the right context. That's one thing I advise. We're a slightly larger organization. We do promotion cycles. We have times during which we promote people. And so if you're talking to me four months before a promo cycle, maybe it's top of mind, maybe it's not. I sometimes functionally cannot promote people inside larger organizations whenever I want.

(00:10:52):
One is, I think, understanding the talent calendar of your team, especially at a larger organization. I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, "I want to be promoted because I want to be a director of PM, because I want to become a manager, because I need direct reports." Instead of saying, "Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here. I have a lot of credibility with this side of the product organization. I think we could be doing more if this position existed. And I think I'm good for this position because of what I've proven A, B and C."

(00:11:43):
That's solving a problem for the company. That's not solving a career growth issue for an individual. And I think people who want to be promoted need to think in that orientation versus the other, because honestly, especially now, let's say [inaudible 00:12:01]. There are not just these wrote every 12 months we're going to give comp increases and merit increases and you get to be promoted. We really have to be thoughtful about the structure and size and organization of teams. Product teams are naturally pretty small.

(00:12:19):
So, there aren't just management and director and senior director roles to go around. And if you want to get into a management, for example, you have to prove that you're good at organization design. I think really focus on why a role is good for a company or necessary for a company and then why you are the best for that role, rather than, "I want to get promoted."

Lenny (00:12:41):
That is such good advice and such important advice that focus on how do you solve problems for your manager and the business, not, "Hey, here's what I need for my career. This sucks. My career is stagnating." I love that. And I love so much of your message is empowerment. It's not just, here, there's the place you're in and there's not a lot you can do about it. Look for opportunities to help your manager, help your business. "Here's what I can do to move things further."

(00:13:06):
And I think there's an element of timing that you touched on. Propose this at a time when something could happen. You shared this example of there was a marketing gap.

Claire Vo (00:13:15):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:13:17):
Is there another example where you did this sort of thing where you presented, "Here's how I can help the org," and that helped another promotion? If not, that's good.

Claire Vo (00:13:25):
It's honestly how I expanded into leading engineering teams in the technology organization. I was at Color and there was a real need to up-level our engineering organization, and I knew exactly what to do. I had high confidence I had the skills, both technical and organizational, to scale the engineering organization in a way that was really critical to the business, both from a architecture perspective and from a team and talent perspective. And so that was one where I knew there was a problem to solve. I knew that problem was important. I knew we had to solve it fast, and I was confident I knew I could do it. I had confidence that I could help there.

(00:14:06):
And so I'm still doing it today. And at Color, I came in as product. I very quickly began leading the engineering organization, which was fabulous, and then I actually took on some of our non-clinical operations as well where we had a pretty operational leader. We had some high-scale challenges to deal with, and it fit my talent set and I knew I could help the company pretty quickly.

(00:14:32):
And this is the other advice I might give particular to PMs. PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role. That was actually my first director role. It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing and I had to develop skills there, but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career. And so I do think also looking left and right outside of your scope of product can be a really effective way to find growth opportunities.

Lenny (00:15:08):
I love that advice, and it leads to so many unexpected opportunities. One of the, I think, big questions with PMs, and coming back to your original advice of know where you want to go, there's so many directions a PM can go. You can eventually become a founder, become a GM, become a CO, something else. And trying these sorts of things often helps you understand, "Here's what I'm actually excited about. Maybe I want to move into design."

Claire Vo (00:15:31):
Yeah, and one of the other things that I think people don't understand, and maybe I experienced this as a founder and I really feel it inside companies, is the universe is bendable to your will. And what I mean is in most, at least in the stage I operate in in startups and growth stage companies and late stage startups, organizations are very fluid and I like to organize around talented motivated individuals.

(00:15:58):
And so just because we're organized in a particular way now, just because these organizations are separate or these are different, together, doesn't mean that's necessarily the way they have to be, and so you should think about your career growth in the existing structure of the organization. But as an org design thinker, it's a very important job that I have to do. You also have to think of this system as a living, breathing entity that can shift over time in particular around highly motivated, highly talented people.

Lenny (00:16:30):
And I think along the same lines, referencing this advice you've already shared of just thinking from the perspective of what is my manager and folks above, what are they struggling with and how can I propose, "Here's a solution that happens to also have me move into a more interesting role?"

Claire Vo (00:16:46):
Yep, exactly.

Lenny (00:16:48):
There's a direction I wasn't planning to go into, but I think it's really important and interesting is people like you that are incredibly good and successful end up taking on a lot, and that often ends up not being what they want.

Claire Vo (00:16:58):
SOS.

Lenny (00:17:00):
Exactly. Any advice on the classic, be careful what you're good at advice? Any advice on just how to not end up with everything?

Claire Vo (00:17:08):
I really believe operating in your zone of genius. I really believe in leaning into strengths. And if you are in a position in which you're good at things and you've been giving a lot of responsibility, but you have tremendous growth edges and you're spending more time on the things you need to level up than the things you are exceptional at, I think that's not fair for the organization. I think that's not fair for you.

(00:17:32):
I truly believe defining and understanding your zone of genius, where you are exceptional, where no one else can step into the job and do just as good of a job as you can, and where you derive tremendous intellectual emotional joy out of the work is what makes it sustainable over time. And so I don't actually think it's about the volume or breadth of the work. It's about sustainability of the work. And can you show up every day energized and engaged and excited about what you do?

(00:18:04):
And I think being very aware if you are operating the space or if you're not. And this might go back to, I think, I have never regretted promoting somebody too slowly, I have regretted promoting somebody too quickly. High-slope individuals in particular areas want to get more responsibility, want to have more scope, and I've seen less experienced managers or directors or even people at my level want to give opportunities that put people in a position where they're neither effective nor happy. And so I think being self-aware of that is really important, and then I also think as a manager, being cognizant of that is really important.

(00:18:50):
Individually, I do do a lot, but I do feel like I'm in my zone of genius and I also know that part of staying in my personal zone of genius is having this breadth of responsibility but preserving builder time. And what I mean from time is I have to have time to produce real work that comes from me as an individual, and that means that calendar management is quite important. Time management.

Lenny (00:19:21):
We're going to talk about some of the things that you built.

(00:19:23):
In terms of finding your zone of genius, any advice for someone that's trying to figure out what it is that is in that zone of genius? I know there's a Ted Talk of here's how to think about the zone of genius specifically [inaudible 00:19:33].

Claire Vo (00:19:32):
Yeah. I'm not going to relay it in precision, but one of the tactics that I've seen out there is basically go through your calendar for the last month or quarter, whatever it is, write everything down, and basically group them into, I hated doing this, I didn't love doing it but it was fine, I love doing this, and then I love doing this, and if I could spend all my time on this, I would be the happiest person in the whole world. And literally categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, "How can I be here more?" And often, that is a true guide to where your passion is, where your special expertise is, and where you're going to add a lot of value because you're highly engaged.

(00:20:26):
I think the other thing is really asking yourself, and this maybe goes back to the career advice perspective, really asking yourself, "What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?" There are lots of things that I do that other people in the organization can do, but what are the things that I do that are... You think about a differentiated product that are hard to replicate, and knowing what that is and leaning into that can drive a lot of exceptional career growth but also just make you quite happy.

Lenny (00:20:58):
What's an example of that for you?

Claire Vo (00:21:00):
I think I'm actually quite good at traversing across and up and down. What I mean is I am fluent across product engineering, design, data and operations, and candidly revenue in a way that vertical or functional leaders maybe are less so. I feel like I have a high level of fluency broadly and can bring conversations between functions together against a business objective pretty easily. It's just the way I'm wired. I was a founder. It's second nature.

(00:21:31):
And the other thing that I think I can do pretty well that I find very joyous is traverse elevation. And so, yes, I love to be up here and think about strategy and vision, but I also like to drop into the details to move things forward. And I think that operating horizontally and then being able to spend some time in the vertical up and down, wherever that vertical up and down happens makes me quite happy. I think I'm pretty good at it.

Lenny (00:21:58):
Amazing. We're going to touch on some of these things you just mentioned actually, but real quick, you mentioned this idea of essentially an energy audit. There's actually a really good guide that I'll point to in the show notes by Matt Mochary that walks you through how to do this. And we talk about this a bunch on this podcast actually, this whole idea of just find things that give you energy, do more of that. Find things that zap you of energy, do less of that. Easier said than done when you have a job and you have to do stuff that people are paying you to do, but it's still really helpful if nothing else to help you point you where you want to be going in your career long-term.

(00:22:29):
Okay, so you mentioned you're a founder, and it feels like you're a founder at heart, but you've been working at larger companies for a while now. And I hear that you're really good at setting a fast pace within larger companies and maintaining that startup focus while also having a very high bar for quality and product. Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, "Yes, move fast, amazing quality." Why would we not want that? I'm curious just what you actually put into practice concretely that allow for you to build teams that move really fast and maintain a high bar. Are there processes you find helpful, values, ways of working?

Claire Vo (00:23:06):
Yeah, it's really funny, people often think that I get hired into the roles that I get hired into in later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup. And so I think about it completely differently.

(00:23:23):
And there are two things I think about in terms of pace and high bar. From a pace, it's know what your internal pace is, and essentially don't let it degrade to the pace of your recurring meetings. I often find that pace of organization locks to pace of the calendar, and so I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, "Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting," it's, "No, we should discuss this now. We should decide this tomorrow."

(00:23:58):
The other thing that I think about is setting one click faster pace expectations inside an organization. I tend to come in and love this, hate it, it's what I do, which is if I look at an organization that is operating at a lower pace than I would expect, I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster, which means if you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half. If you think it needs to be done this half, it needs to be done this quarter. This quarter, this month. This week, today. End of day, in this meeting. And actually setting an expectation that your natural pace is going to be slower than your ambition and being explicit about pulling things in I think can change the way expectations are set and honestly change the energy and momentum in the organization.

(00:24:51):
The third thing on pace is personal SLA. I never want to be a bottleneck for the organization. This is one of the more challenging things about being in my role, is you are often a point of decision-making, tie-breaking, next steps, approvals, socialization. And if my personal SLA is slow, then the rest of my organization cannot be as fast as possible. I try to be fairly responsive. I try to say, "Do both very high rate," and also very quickly. It's really hard, sometimes it's not totally possible, but it's a goal I have.

Lenny (00:25:27):
I love this clock speed concept of just let's move one iteration faster than we would normally move. How do you actually do that? Is this just you doing it and then everyone trickles down from the way you're approaching it? Is this a principle on a team? Is there a phrase you use?

Claire Vo (00:25:41):
Yeah, it's a phrase I use and something I asked our leadership teams to do. It started at, one, I'm going to do this, and two, my expectation is you look for opportunities to do this. And the reason I think this is effective, it's very tangible and it's very tactical. It just is one of those things that a moment when you're about to say a due date, you check yourself and you go, "Is this right or do I need to pull it in by an iteration?" And so it's a very tactical piece of advice and expectation I give to my leadership team. If they can show up that way, then the expected pace of the organization goes up, and then people tend to rise to the occasion.

Lenny (00:26:26):
And then it connects very directly to your first piece of advice, is not rely on the meeting cadence to determine your action cadence. I imagine that's a similar situation where you tell people, "Here's how I want to operate," and then you actually work that way and that starts to filter through.

Claire Vo (00:26:41):
Yeah, I just think there's this anti-pattern of, "We'll make the decision in the next meeting," or, "We'll follow up on this in the next meeting." That is an artificial timeline introduced by Google Calendar or whatever calendar you use. It's not a real thing, and so I want to put us on real timelines. When can we make the decision? How much information do we need? And that doesn't mean that every decision is made now, today, tomorrow, but it does mean we don't snap to artificial cadences to make our product move forward.

Lenny (00:27:12):
Awesome. Let's talk about quality. What are some lessons there?

Claire Vo (00:27:17):
Yeah, I think in terms of high bar, there's probably two things that I think about as a leader. There's the talent bar being exceptionally high, and then there's the product bar being high.

(00:27:28):
I'll start with talent, which is, on the talent side I think you have to define the bar. You have to be really specific, and that means you have to think about pretty deeply what are your leadership principles? If your leadership principle is bring the clock speed up one iteration, be explicit that that's what you expect to see, and then articulate that and hold people accountable to it.

(00:27:51):
And so I do think it's really important to have a specific and measurable career ladder, especially at the senior levels. I often find that they're very soft. They're hires and manages multiple departments or takes in cross-functional stakeholder feedback. Those are just not tractable, specific things. And so I think, PMs, put on your product definition or OKR hat or whatever and define some real goals for these levels and be specific in a way that you can look at people and say, definitively, "Yes. Measurably, yes, they're meaning this bar measurably. No, they're not meeting that bar." And so I think that's very important.

(00:28:39):
The second thing I think is you have to normalize feedback. And Brené Brown, fellow Texan, love her, "Clear is kind," I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar. They just do, because the expectations are not stated and you're not holding accountability. And I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers. That is not helping them become the best teammate that they can become.

(00:29:08):
I really like to normalize feedback and, as I say, take the temperature out of the room when it comes to open and candid feedback. And that means being very clear when people are not meeting expectations, making it very clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent. And I think that has something that people need to hear to normalize feedback. But I think feedback is quite important.

(00:29:30):
And I think the third thing is unfortunately when you're working to build a high talent bar and high talent density, then when folks aren't a fit and it's not working, moving against that quickly is part of the job. And it's a hard part of the job and it's part of the job that most managers really avoid, but I think it's important because it keeps your overall team operating in a really healthy, effective, performant way that makes everybody happier, including people that probably weren't a great fit for the work of the role at the time.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Is there an example of you being surprisingly candid to someone or giving feedback, hard feedback, to someone about quality, something that's just like, "Oh wow, that's what I should be doing?"

Claire Vo (00:30:16):
There were two leaders in my organization, I won't say which ones and I won't say when, but two leaders in the organization, partners across product and engineering, and they could not get it together. They could not work together. They were having misalignments and priorities strategy. They could not communicate. They were having conflict in front of the team.

(00:30:38):
And the managers that had managed them were taking this very soft pedal approach of, "You need to work on your [inaudible 00:30:47] functional stakeholder, and here am I expecting all this performance management stuff to happen." And I called both of them individually and I said, "The way you are operating is not meeting our leadership expectations. If you do not change, you cannot be part of this organization anymore. I believe you can operate differently. I do." And I did. I believe these are very talented people who could operate. "I believe you can operate differently, but it is your responsibility to do so, and I need to see change starting tomorrow."

(00:31:20):
I wanted them to succeed. And in fact, they did. It snapped in, they got it, and one of the... Turned into one of the most influential effective managers in our team over the course of probably the next six to nine months. And I think just clearly saying, "You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path. I believe you can get here, but it is your responsibility." That is the conversation that is clear and kind and honestly very effective in most instances.

Lenny (00:31:55):
That's an amazing example. Clear is kind, as you said. It reminds me of Kim Scott, who's on the podcast, shared this story about Bob. I don't know if you remember that story at all of just this guy at their company who was just doing a bad job and everyone knew he was doing a bad job, and then they had to fire him. When they're firing him, he's just like, "Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone tell me that nobody thought I was doing a great job?"

Claire Vo (00:32:16):
And I honestly think saying, "You are not doing a good job," is much kinder than, "I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect." Or, "I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at..." That's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else.

Lenny (00:32:36):
Okay, let's go in a different direction. Let's talk about being a woman in tech.

Claire Vo (00:32:40):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:32:41):
This doesn't get talked about a ton on podcasts like this. I know you have a lot of thoughts. Obviously, you've been through a lot. You've had a lot of experiences. There's probably a lot of stories you haven't shared in other places, so I just want to give you a chance to share what you've been through, what you've seen, and any advice you may have.

Claire Vo (00:32:58):
Yeah, and I'm happy to talk about this. I know a lot of people don't want to be defined or consistently asked about being a woman or a mom in a C-level leadership role. Let's not have women in tech panels anymore. But I've been reflecting a bit on this lately because I just came from a few years in healthcare, which, from my experience, it's a lot more women in leadership roles. I was a little spoiled, even in our technology organization. And now, I'm back in startups and tech, where the ratios are completely opposite, especially in roles like engineering, which is a team that I run.

(00:33:30):
And look, this is just, it's math. I think Carta said that 13-something percent of founders last year were women. It's declining year over year. FEMA led founded teams, or at least 2% of venture capital, women hold 30% of senior leadership org roles. Women are 30% of software engineering teams. This is just math. We're just facts. We're not in the room in the equal proportions. And as somebody who has, despite the numbers, had a fairly successful career so far in technology, I feel like I owe it to the industry to say it hasn't been easy and it's still not easy, even at my level.

(00:34:09):
And what I want to be clear about, because it gets talked about a lot in forms like this, this is not about imposter syndrome. How could I have any right to imposter syndrome? I've proven myself. I've been a founder, I've raised venture capital, I've had a successful exit. I've been, as you said, a CPO across increasing large teams. I get to invest in red companies. I'm on boards. I get to be on this podcast. I'm a TikTok influencer. This is not about feeling like an imposter. It's really about, it is hard and it is different, and the numbers pencil out in a way that is not favorable to women.

(00:34:47):
And as you said, there's been a lot of stuff in the past that you look at me now and you say, "Oh, she did associate and all the way up," but I had to fight for my all-girls school to carry computer science at the same rate that the all-boys school had it naturally. I grew up in teeny tiny startups in the early aughts. I saw some nonsense. I had VCs tell me, "Don't get pregnant," when I was... These things happened. And yet here I am, and it's fine.

(00:35:21):
And I'm not complaining. I just think what people also don't understand is that stuff still happens. I don't need to litigate who it happens with, where it happens. It still happens. I have arrived and it still happens. And the reason I bring this up is I think it should be a point of reflection for industry, and I think it can be a really effective point of reflection for women who want to get into leadership roles.

(00:35:46):
And the way I approach it is I'm just very curious. I wonder what is structural about technology that creates these things happen? What is cultural? What is external? What has happened to me or happens around me? What is internal? What do I bring into the room that doesn't serve me? And so I try to stay very curious. And then constant product thinker, what are the points of leverage I can use to move things not just forward for me, but for the industry broadly? How can I influence thinking? Where can I not? Where can I walk away from things?

(00:36:24):
And then as for the internal aspect of it, I think this is also a very powerful thing, which is I try to stay in an empowered space. I know my value. I have no time for imposter syndrome. It's not a constructive thing for me, but I do think knowing that, as I said earlier, the universe is bendable to your will. There are things we can change. I don't think these numbers are not tractable. And so my recommendation and what I'd love to say to the industry generally, to women in particular, is curiosity and empowerment have been my path to joy in this sometimes complicated industry. And I think there's a lot better we can do. There's a little bit of ways to go.

Lenny (00:37:10):
Is there a story that you could share if you're comfortable of just something you've gone through or been through that maybe people are like, "Oh, wow, I see what stuff she's dealing with or other women are dealing with that I had no sense of?"

Claire Vo (00:37:21):
I've been trying to wrap my head around this one, which is I consistently get asked if I'm technical enough. Not even if I'm technical enough. Let's put enough aside. If I'm technical. And it's fascinating to me because as a technical co-founder of my startup, I wrote code for the first 12 months solo. I led the engineering team there. That code is still in production in very large environments. I have run multi-hundred people, engineering teams for many years, and I spend my Saturdays and Sundays shipping code. This is what I do. And truly, the first question most people ask me is, "Oh, well you're not technical though. You're a product person."

(00:38:11):
And I've been really trying to unpack where that is coming from. It's hard for me to imagine somebody else that looks different, that has a different name, that has a different gender getting that question with my background. And so that's one of those things that has really been spinning my head. Again, it's not about imposter syndrome. I don't have anything to prove to people, but I am quite curious where that orientation comes from. And if it comes to somebody like me, who has really had some proven success, I know it's happening to other people, and I'm hoping that I can do something from my position to turn that a little bit.

Lenny (00:38:50):
And this connects to what you shared, the advice you had of just try to get curious about why it's happening, which is exactly what you just said. Is that just mostly to help you not get upset and frustrated? Let me just understand, why is this happening again and again?

Claire Vo (00:39:02):
One, I do think sitting in your power is very effective. And so curiosity means that I'm in control, and I do think I'm in control more than I'm not. That's one part of it is, I think. And the other thing is I think a lot of this is it's complicated. It's structural, it's cultural. It's what you see and what you don't see, not just in the workplace. It's what you see and don't see in media. Am I reading my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old books of, "My grandma's a software engineer?"

(00:39:35):
Books called the Mom Test, which I actually think is a great book, but it has this underlying presumption of who is technical, who's not, who understands things, who doesn't. And that all bubbles up into how individuals experience an industry that's driving tremendous economic growth here, where at the end of the day, it's about economic participation. It can be about individuals and aspirations, but it is also about economic participation.

(00:40:00):
The reason I'm curious about it is I do think it's complicated and I do think you can be successful, but I don't think we're being successful at the rates I would love to see. And I think we're missing a lot of innovation and a lot of economic growth by not having incredible, technical, capable women start companies and lead organizations. And so I think we're all missing out for that, and I'd love to see more of it.

Lenny (00:40:25):
And is there an answer to how do we do this better? Anything you think, hey, you've seen work to help get us past this?

Claire Vo (00:40:34):
I think normalize seeing it, so thanks for bringing me on this podcast, but I do think normalize seeing it is one of the simplest ways. If you close your eyes and imagine a software engineer, my dream is you imagine a diverse set of folks. You don't imagine a very specific art type. And so I do think you can't believe it unless you see it, and so the more that you can provide platforms for diverse voices to talk about their journey in technology, expose that there are leaders out there that come from different backgrounds, technically, culturally, all those things, the more the industry can imagine different types of leaders in different types of roles.

(00:41:17):
And so I just want to see it more. I want to invest more and raise the voices of female founders. I want to call out their amazing female CTOs out there, all those things. And I think if you can see it, you can start to unlock these very embedded concepts of who is and is not a technology leader who is and is not technical.

Lenny (00:41:40):
Awesome. I love that advice. It's something I try really hard to do with this podcast.

(00:42:36):
I know you have a fun story about when you were very pregnant selling your startup to Optimizely. Can you share that story? I haven't actually heard the story.

Claire Vo (00:42:45):
Yeah, this was a fun one. Again, this is the universe is bendable to your will and lean into your power, which is, I had been running Experiment Engine, which was a platform for enterprises to run high scale experimentation programs. Not necessarily the underlying A/B testing technology, but all the stuff around hypothesis gathering, insights, aggregation, operations, keeping things on track. Because I really know, as you do, that high scale experimentation programs can be very impactful to businesses.

(00:43:19):
That being said, it was like a niche inside in industry, as opposed to a large TAM problem. And so I think we just fundamentally hit a TAM ceiling here. We had a great product for a great market that was very narrow. And three years, four years into running the company, I knew that to be true and I knew that we would be better served by being part of a larger organization, and one of those organizations could be a large testing company. And so I remember that was noodling on my mind, but we were also really trying to sell to enterprises.

(00:43:52):
And I heard that Microsoft, who was one of our biggest customers, was doing a experimentation day with Optimizely, and I knew Optimizely was a natural acquirer. And I knew I had to get into that room, so I called Microsoft and I said, "Hey, friend of Microsoft, I'm going to be up in Seattle seeing our other customer, very large Seattle company, this week, week of experimentation day. Could we stop by?" And they're like, "Oh yeah, sure." Well, then I went to other big Seattle companies and said, "Hey, other big Seattle company, I'm going to be up Microsoft at their experimentation day. Would you be..."

(00:44:34):
I got these two meetings to manifest against each other, and then I walked into that experimentation day and I eyeballed the CFO of Optimizely and I sat in front of him and started pulling up the product and coding at the same time. I was just like, "I'm going to sit in front of him in the row and I'm going to do this and we're going to have my screens." And then I went up and did a demo. And I'm not saying that's the thing that made it happen, but I will say very quickly after that, we became very close partners and ultimately they acquired me.

(00:45:06):
And I give this advice to founders because one of the things that, and founders and PMs, one of the things that I really hire for is scrappiness. I think you have to be able to do a lot with a little, and I think you have to know where you're getting and, come hell or high water, figure out a way to get there. And this was a very fun example of working my way into the right room, setting myself up for the success that I wanted, and having the backing, the good job, the great product, the outcomes to earn it. But you also have to get yourself in the room.

Lenny (00:45:39):
And how many months pregnant were you?

Claire Vo (00:45:44):
I was extremely pregnant. A ticking time bomb of a belly is a really good negotiation tactic in a deal. I think I remember when we were negotiating the final term sheet, I was 34 weeks pregnant, something like that, and they said, "Can you fly out to San Francisco?" I was in Austin at the time. And I said, "Literally, you can fly me out today and back tomorrow, and then I'm not allowed on planes." And that's how. It was very fun. It was fun, and what a happy acquisition. I can talk all day about how that was great. Great experience.

Lenny (00:46:11):
And I love it's another example of the phrase you've been coming back to of bending, I don't know if it's bending the world to your will.

Claire Vo (00:46:17):
Bending the universe towards your will.

Lenny (00:46:19):
The universe? Even bigger. I love it. It feels like a recurring theme here, is to take agency and control where your career and life is going. And that's such a good example of just finding a way into this room that would be very hard for someone to get into.

(00:46:33):
You've touched on the CTPO role that I haven't heard much about. And I know that this is a big topic for you, and I feel like there might be a trend happening here of combining engineering product. Can you just talk about this role and why you think it might be emerging?

Claire Vo (00:46:51):
Yeah, I get asked about it a lot because it's not super rare, but it's not super common either, and I think it could potentially be rising. And I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. It's very different. I've done both. It's very different than a pure product or a VP product role.

(00:47:13):
And so first, I talked a little bit about how I got into this role. I do think you have to be technical to do a role like this. I think a lot of people look at my professional background and think that I use my broad leadership skills and leverage of a great SVP to keep engineering team going. But no, actually I spent quite a bit of time on the engineering side, because as somebody who is responsible for the business outcomes of the product, one of the best ways to drive value is having a highly performant engineering team that works on a scalable platform.

(00:47:45):
And so I spend a lot of time making sure that we're building the right architectural decisions, that our infrastructure meets the needs of our team, that our edge team is operating in a way that drives velocity. And I just don't think you can do that job if you don't understand how software gets built on a technical level. So I'm the kind of person that when we're doing a product review, I have the PRD up and GitHub up and I'm comparing both, because I think both sides matter.

(00:48:10):
I think the other thing that's different about this role is it's quite operational, and so you really have to know about operations and organization design. Edge teams are by nature much larger than product organizations. You just think about the classic ratios, there are more people in engineering than there are in product. And the talent challenges are significantly different in engineering, whether it's the high volume of recruiting, culture-shaped challenges are different. You have to really think about org design. And so you have to have a different level of mindset around organization design and operations when you're in a CPTO role.

(00:48:51):
You're on pager duty. You're getting paged at 1:00 AM if a service, if there's a Sub-Zero and it goes down. That is not what it's like to be a product leader. So you got to know what you're getting into and you have to be technical. And then the thing I would be remiss to say about this role is the P and the T get a lot of air time. Product and engineering get a lot of air time. Design data, these are such functional, very important organizations, and why these roles get... That's what the role is and how you could be good at it or whether it would be a fit for your skills.

(00:49:24):
The question of why have this kind of role, and I think there's two reasons. There's the obvious strategic reason of, they're all the same thing. They're all building capital P product, they're all builders, they're the same types of folks, they're all builders, and bringing them under one house allows you to optimize for the whole, as opposed to optimize for the function. And if you can find a leader that is effective at that, I think you can get a lot of value added. And honestly, the second thing is it provides a tremendous amount of leverage to the CEO in many ways. At the end of the day, R&D is a very expensive and complicated investment the company is making, and having a single person responsible for R&D investment at the executive level is quite important, especially when you're candidly spending a lot there.

(00:50:21):
And so I think it's those two things. It's, these are one team. There should be be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design. It should be what is best for the organization at whole. What do our customers need and what do our business needs? And then it's the accountability candidly of this quite meaningful investment against business objectives and having a singularly responsible individual to care for that investment.

Lenny (00:50:46):
It sounds wonderful, having one person to deal with across all these functions.

Claire Vo (00:50:50):
It is and isn't. I'll just say, I've done both. I've been a CPO next to an SVP of Eng. I've run both together. Founders can play this role. And again, this is why I say you have to optimize around talent in your organization. If your CEO has the skills, bandwidth, et cetera, to do this, they can do this. You can keep the organization separate. They can hold that. If they have a different area of expertise, if they've never done that before, if it's just not working operationally, they have broader areas of focus, then bring it together under someone. I don't think there's a perfect organization structure. This has just been one that's worked well in the shape of organizations that need someone like me.

Lenny (00:51:33):
And along the same lines, designing an org around the person, I imagine there's not many very engineering background experience people that are also really good at product and can do design. I guess how deep do you need to be in each of these functions to be successful in this role? Because it feels really rare.

Claire Vo (00:51:51):
Start a company and then you have to do it, in some ways. I've worked for both and they've told me, I've worked for two, they go, "I'm not a founder, but I'm the CEO." And I go, "That's fine. I'm an operator, but I'm going to bring a founder mindset."

(00:52:08):
And so I think as a founder, especially early stage, you do all of this. You see how all of this is one person, because honestly sometimes it is one person, and sometimes that person is you. And so I do think working in a very small startup gives you the opportunity to experience a breadth of functional skills and develop a breadth of functional skills that can set you up for this kind of role much further down the line. I do think early stage startup experience is one of those shortcuts to getting visibility here.

(00:52:46):
I think the other thing is, again, I said this earlier, so many people get siloed into, "I'm a product manager, and so my job is this, but it's not that. And I can only do this, and if designs are needed, I am blocked and I will just wait." And I just give permission for people to make... We have a leadership principle inside our team that's like, "There are no lanes." Our lanes are dotted. They're not solid in that you can shift over and pencil out a design, an engineer can write a spec. All those things are fine. They're natural, they're normal, and I actually think they're quite healthy. And it's that kind of thinking that probably is going to breed the type of leaders that could do this type of role.

Lenny (00:53:29):
Awesome. It reminds me at GitLab. I just interviewed their head of product, or CPO, and they have a core value of, "Short toes." Don't worry about stepping on people's toes. Have short toes. Don't worry about people getting into your stuff. It's all good.

Claire Vo (00:53:43):
Yep.

Lenny (00:53:43):
Okay. You mentioned AI. Amazing segue to my next topic that I want to spend some time on. You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there, other than some big company's tool like, I don't know, Sprague or Figma or something like that. First of all, just what is ChatPRD, and then why did you build it?

Claire Vo (00:54:06):
Yeah. ChatPRD comes out of, again, pace setting. And I'll actually tell you the real genesis of ChatPRD, which is at a previous company we had a quite technical product we needed to build. We're scrappy and resource-constrained, and our platform PMs were working on something very important, but this was critical and we needed to get it done. And we didn't really have a platform technical PM to spec this thing out. And it was quite complicated.

(00:54:35):
And I raised my hand and I said, "I'll IC this. I think I know what we need." And between the beginning of the meeting and the end of the meeting, I had used ChatGPT and a prompt to come up with a very serviceable PRD spec for this very technical product. And I took that prompt and that long-running ChatGPT thread and crafted the Claire version of a product leader or product person that could, with really solid consistency, output product specs, give good feedback, build out plans, build out tracking mechanisms and goals.

(00:55:20):
And so while I say, "She may just be a prompt, but she is prompt," this was lovingly crafted over several months. And so when the GPT Store came out, for my team I just said, "Hey, you all know I've been writing PRDs with ChatGPT." I created a GPT and just gave it to my team. I was like, "Here, you can use this if you want it." And they really liked it, and other people started asking about it and I eventually ran into the monetization and access wall that is the GPT Store right now. And so I've also been having a lot of fun coding again, and so I thought, this is easy. We're just going to stand up a standalone app and wrap, come on, it's a wrapper, it started as wrapper, wrap some of these capabilities and just publish it and put a fairly reasonable price tag on it and see what happens.

(00:56:12):
And now, I have thousands of people using ChatPRD. Every day, people are creating dozens of specs and PRDs every month. It's everything from, "I'm an engineer on a team with too few PMs and I get blocked, so I'm going to build my own requirements," to, "I'm a solo founder and I need to put some structure on my thought for my team," to, "I'm a PM and this has saved me truly hours of work to get the basics of my product requirements done so I can spend time on the details." And then I've added on more functions and capabilities than the standalone app. It is my personal product copilot that I've released for the world.

Lenny (00:56:49):
Okay. First of all, where can people check this out? Is it chatprd.com?

Claire Vo (00:56:53):
.ai. Come on.

Lenny (00:56:54):
.ai, of course.

Claire Vo (00:56:54):
Yeah, chatprd.ai.

Lenny (00:56:58):
I saw some stuff about the country that has .ai is just making so much bank right now.

Claire Vo (00:57:01):
So much money.

Lenny (00:57:02):
All these domains.

(00:57:04):
Then in terms of the stack, just to be clear, so it started as a ChatGPT prompt, custom prompt, you evolved, then it became a GPT, a custom GPT, and now it's your own app that is using the OpenAI APIs behind-

Claire Vo (00:57:17):
It is, yeah. It's using the assistance APIs. And what's different about the standalone app versus the GPT is every person that uses the standalone app gets a customized assistant. It learns from their specific content. It learns from their role. It learns from their company. If you use the GPT version, you're not getting that customization. When you use the standalone app, you are getting that customization. And then I've layered on a couple of different capabilities. In addition to having the chat format, it will actually create the document for you and iterate on the actual doc for you, and then working on some additional tools and integrations in the future.

Lenny (00:57:55):
Okay, great. What are the most common use cases again? Just so people can get a sense of, "Oh, let me use this for these things."

Claire Vo (00:58:00):
Yeah, about 60% of people use it to put in an idea and get a PRD out. Just get the specs of what are my objectives and user goals, what are user stories, what is out of scope, walk through the UX. In our standard template, I have what's called a narrative, which is, how do you pitch this product? Which I feel like is a thing product managers miss a lot, which is how to position and pitch it, sequencing and milestones, measurements and goals, all those sorts of things.

(00:58:33):
Now, that's the out-of-the-box template. As I said, you can actually customize what your PRD template is in ChatPRD if you do something different or want something different for your company. About 60% of people are using it for that. 30% of people, I would say, are using it to put in a spec or a PRD or a strategy doc or a roadmap and improve it. And then the rest are using it to brainstorm ideas, internal PM work. How do I come up with a good agenda for X, Y, and Z? That kind of stuff.

Lenny (00:59:02):
Amazing. Okay, so I wrote a post recently sharing a bunch of examples of how people are using different GPT specifically at work, and I think it's spurred a lot of people to experiment with this stuff. If there's one tip that you could share for someone that's trying to build a GPT or their own custom app using APIs, any advice?

Claire Vo (00:59:24):
Prompt matters. We went through this whole cycle of prompt engineering is a thing, it's not really a thing, fine-tuning is... Prompt really does matter, and a good PM, I do competitive analysis. I use the same input and look at different GPT or ChatGPT. I look at the GPT Store version, I look at other PM tools that do this and I look at mine. I think mine is actually better.

(00:59:50):
And then I'm getting into a mode now where I may do some model experimentation and tuning behind the scenes, so it might not be OpenAI, it may be other things, but it matters. The instructions matter, the context matters for the quality of the output is something that I would say when building these kinds of products. I think the other thing is there is no solution right now for monetization. Knock on wood, open it and we'll figure it out. If I had more time, maybe I would create a platform out of what I've created for ChatGPT to let other people monetize their GPTs and add on capabilities. But it's not out of the box yet for folks. There's a lot of work that I had to do to get it from here to there.

Lenny (01:00:31):
Are you making real money with this thing? And is it an idea that this becomes the thing you do someday maybe long term?

Claire Vo (01:00:38):
My original goal, and I said this out on X, my original goal is I just want to buy a nice glass of wine a week. That was my goal. I could buy cases of wine now. This is very exciting for me. It's making what I would consider real money. Is it a venture scale thing? No. Does it need to be? No. I have a goal around my kids' education expenses. I would love for this to cover a little bit. I have a ambitious but not audacious goal for ChatPRD.

(01:01:13):
The other goal that I have, which is, let's put monetization aside, is this is my joy space, zone of genius joy space. And my goal with ChatPRD is it has to be a hundred percent fun for me. This is my hobby, so I'm not doing anything that makes it not fun. It is a pure bliss space for me. I get to code on the weekends, I get to do customer support at night, and I get to build things that I would use. I get to learn new technologies. I want to keep it in that space because it provides a lot of joy for me. Put money aside, I just want it to be fun.

Lenny (01:01:51):
Love that. Okay, so some people listening to this, especially PMs, may be like, "Claire, what the hell are you doing? Are you going to replace product managers in a year or two?" This connects to something I've just generally been thinking about and that's come up a bunch, is just over time, which skills and jobs of a product manager will be greatly enhanced by AI and which will be completely replaced by AI, if any, so that people can understand which skills they should be investing in and which maybe are less important.

(01:02:22):
I guess just broadly, do you have a sense of just here's skills that are going to continue to be incredibly important and AI will not take these skills and jobs off your plate? Versus, these are going to be the less important, AI will do these?

Claire Vo (01:02:36):
At the highest level, I tend to be very short-term pessimistic, although I'll frame that short-term pessimistic and very long-term optimistic. I am a big believer that technology has made society generally much more affluent, wealthier, happier, healthier. I am a big believer in technology and I am optimistic about its impact on the human race. There are lots of things that are not going well, but I really do believe that innovation and technology, I'm excited for my kid's future. I'm not afraid of it.

(01:03:11):
Now, that being said, I am of the mind excitedly that this is going to change stuff in companies incredibly quickly. And part of building ChatPRD is I hold myself to the bar as a technology leader, I need to be leading the league on understanding what this can disrupt, using these tools to make a better team, and actually shifting the size and shape of my organization in response to the technology around us. Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the ratios between PMs and other teams going to shift over time? Yes. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably. I think there's a lot of change coming and I want to be prepared for it.

(01:04:00):
Now, what do I think this replaces and what does it not replace? I was reflecting on this question and communication, lowercase C, I feel like is one of the places that's going to be replaced. And I call it lowercase C. It's the functional trading of information that allows other people to do jobs. I think that these language models and these tools are really good synthesizing information, putting together communication, and can coordinate who that communication goes to and get it out in many modalities of content.

(01:04:41):
And so I'm really thinking about the PM as the keeper of cross-functional relationships and communication is really, I think, potentially going to change. Now, but capital C communication of are you influential? Are you convincing? Are you bold? Can you get this system of humans to follow you down a path? That's, I think, going to be much harder to replace, and so I'm thinking about the edges of communication and where they'll change and what they won't.

Lenny (01:05:15):
That's really interesting. I did a little poll on Twitter asking people of between communication, execution, strategy, and product sense, which skills are most likely to be basically taken over by AI. And communication was number one, by far. I have a contrarian perspective. And strategy was the least voted. I feel like, so strategy work is essentially, "Here's everything we know about the world and competitors and the market and our advantages. Here's a plan to win in the market essentially." I feel like that's what AI is incredibly good at.

Claire Vo (01:05:49):
I agree with you. I totally agree with you. I think, and again this comes to synthesis, good decision-making, and communication, if you can synthesize, distill it into a plan and communicate that plan, I found these tools exceptional. Use ChatPRD and give it a try.

(01:06:09):
Now, I think it's the human aspect though of boldness, seeing the future in a way that a thing trained on priors cannot. Those things I still think, and then charisma and attracting all those things to actually make the thing happen are pretty hard to replicate, which is why I love using ChatPRD. I'm not going to come up with the most genius way to do data export for Snowflake for some... That is a solved area that we should just scaffold up. I should customize it to what we do, and then we should ship it. That is not a place where my magic skills as a human are going to impact.

(01:06:54):
But I don't think a lot of PMs see it that way. I think there's this real identity shift that's going to happen where PMs think that their value is coming from their ideas that they manifest into the world and how they individually manifest them. And I think we're going to shift to, are you building the right stuff? Are you building it quickly? And is it delivering? No matter what the tool chain is.

Lenny (01:07:19):
Yeah. I think your point about getting buy-in and getting everyone aligned, I don't know how an AI bot does that unless everybody's got their own little bot and they're all talking to each other.

Claire Vo (01:07:29):
They all just get along.

Lenny (01:07:30):
We're in. I'll [inaudible 01:07:32] this a little higher.

Claire Vo (01:07:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:33):
I actually made this list. I feel like this could be the entire podcast, but I made it a quick list of, "Here's the jobs of a PM." And it's interesting. I don't know if this is really a question, but it's just interesting to think about which of these will some ChatPRD maybe do in the future. What does the job feel? You're writing PRDS, you're setting goals, proposing a roadmap, aligning a team behind a roadmap, developing a strategy, developing a vision, communicating timelines, finding blockers, and unblocking people, getting buy-in from up on high, getting budget resources for your team, giving feedback on product and design. Those are just some of the day-to-day jobs. I'm so curious just which of these AI can actually just do and not have to worry about it.

Claire Vo (01:08:17):
I think a lot of them AI can do. And so the question is, which of them do you want to hand the keys to an AI tool? And which of them are going to be much more valuable as a tool that an individual or a team's intellect can use to do a better, faster, higher impact job?

(01:08:38):
Again, I believe in technology and I think this stuff, what's interesting about this moment right now is every week I see something that I would not have in a million years thought was possible three years ago. Every week, something new comes out where it just changes my mind of what's possible. I believe all of those are 80% good functionally tractable. The question is, is 80% good functionally tractable the best way to do that? Or can we take a certain type of person with a certain skill set backed by a purpose-built toolkit and make it 3X better, 4X better, 10X better? I think that's the more interesting question.

Lenny (01:09:16):
I think on the point of amazing things are happening every day, we had SpaceX launched the Starship and it was barely mentioned anywhere. We have the spaceship that could take us to Mars and, "Meh, we don't need to talk about that."

Claire Vo (01:09:31):
We get the kids up and stream it on YouTube.

Lenny (01:09:32):
Oh, that's awesome.

Claire Vo (01:09:33):
It's magic. We live in this magic time. I think it's so fascinating. But I agree, we're getting spoiled by innovation.

Lenny (01:09:41):
You said that there's this ratio that might shift with product managers, engineers. I'm curious which ratio, because engineers are also getting more efficient, and so it's interesting if the ratios will be consistent as engineers become more efficient, PMs get it more efficient.

Claire Vo (01:09:53):
I wonder if whole roles get eliminated and replaced, and then ratios aren't even the right way to think about things. There's the ratio of this PM role to this many, one PM to seven to 10 engineers or one EM to... There's those ratios.

(01:10:12):
I also think there's going to be this interesting shift of as a manager, as a leader, how you allocate budget against tools and people I also think is going to shift. And I saw something where somebody said that every role that they got asked to open, the team had to spend a week trying to automate it before they were allowed to open the JD. It's just this very interesting... In my mind people, think that's scary and it's going to reduce jobs. Yes, and I do think there's also potentially other jobs that open up that can become very interesting.

(01:10:45):
And so I don't know how it's going to pencil out. I really don't. What I do know is things are going to change and I, as a leader and a person that cares for people's long-term careers, want to be much more forward-thinking than close my eyes to what the possible maybe dramatic changes are in our industry. I'm thinking about it, I'm experimenting with things, and I'm hoping that in our team in LaunchDarkly we're leading from the front here as opposed to on our back foot.

Lenny (01:11:17):
I'm thinking many people listening here are like, "Okay, I need to get on top of this. I need to stay ahead. I want to follow Claire's lead." Is your advice simply create GPTs, play with ChatGPT? Is there anything else there to help people?

Claire Vo (01:11:29):
I also think PMs need to be thinking about building product skills particularly around these non-deterministic products. It's been [inaudible 01:11:40]. Part of why I built ChatPRD is not just to stress test how these sorts of things are going to change the product function. It's literally, this is a new type of product built by a new type of technology and it's moving very fast. And learning how to build these kinds of products, if you can do that, I just think back to when mobile happened, if you're a PM that jumped on mobile, you had the pick of the litter when it came to jobs in very interesting startups.

(01:12:11):
And so I think we're in the same moment here where, if you can ratchet down and specialize and learn a new technology, you actually can get into very interesting positions. Those are both of my motivations on ChatPRD, is understand how it impacts the function that I lead, but also understand how to build a great product with these underlying technologies that are just much different than the technologies that I personally built on before.

Lenny (01:12:37):
And so for someone, let's say, not super engineering-oriented, I guess how do you recommend people on your team explore this sort of thing? Is it [inaudible 01:12:46]?

Claire Vo (01:12:45):
Yeah. I do think studying products that are out there is quite interesting. I love this idea of doing outside-in product tear-downs. What is good about this? What is bad about this? How would I have written the PRD here? What would I be measuring? How would I think about error states? How would I think about if this is a great product, a good product, or an okay product? I do think doing that sort of crit on an external product can be a really accessible way to start to stress test your own skills around this and figure out where there are gaps.

(01:13:20):
That's one thing I think you can do. Two, I think there's a lot of no-code, low-code stuff you can play with. Even if you can't put your hands on keyboard and write code, you can certainly stitch together things and try some no-code tools. That's another way to do it. The other thing is find where it's fun. I think how fun is Midjourney? How fun are some of these more creative tools? And so find where there's something fun and build art out of it as a mechanism for learning. It doesn't always have to be commercially driven. It doesn't have to be part of work. It can just be find a space that you're personally interested in and play with what's out there.

Lenny (01:14:00):
Awesome. One last question about ChatPRD. With Copilot, there's all these stats. It's making engineers 50% more efficient, whatever percentage. Do you have any sense of efficiency gains so far with ChatPRD?

Claire Vo (01:14:14):
I have qualitative feedback from product managers who have used ChatPRD, who have said, "This has saved me dozens of hours I would've spent on writing documents." And another person said, "I am a single PM on a team that's growing and I don't think we're going to have to hire another PM now." There's the people, there's both the individual aspect and the hours aspect, which is it's helping individuals PMs get higher leverage across a broad engineering or building team, and that it's helping them spend their time more effectively.

Lenny (01:14:57):
Many people don't want to hear that they don't need to hire a PM. There's many people looking for jobs right now.

Claire Vo (01:14:59):
It's true, but we can't... I think we saw this in the last couple of years. Inefficiently hiring and building unsustainable costs into a company leads no one to success. And if that's a lesson that I can teach anybody, it's sustainability in organizations is the responsibility of a leader. Yes, I would love to give everybody positions. There are not positions to have. And the best I can do for the people in the team is be really responsible and really thoughtful about that because that helps me grow their careers and helps me sustain their careers long-term.

(01:15:41):
It's incredibly complicated, but also on the flip side, this is a very small startup. They can't afford another PM and they're extending their runway to build something transformational by not growing the team. And so, yes, people [inaudible 01:15:57] their teams and have these jobs and startups can't afford it, and they still have great things to do in the world.

Lenny (01:16:04):
Great answer. To start to wrap up our conversation, I have these two segments, Failure Corner and Contrarian Corner, and we can pick which corner you want to head to. Would you like to share a story of your career where you failed and something you learned from that? Or something you believe that most people don't believe? Which corner sounds more interesting?

Claire Vo (01:16:24):
I'll take Contrarian Corner.

Lenny (01:16:26):
Let's go for there.

Claire Vo (01:16:27):
Yep.

Lenny (01:16:28):
I need some sound effects for these corners. Do share.

Claire Vo (01:16:33):
I'm sharing this because you just released your podcast with Marty again. And I'm a sales-led product apologist unabashedly, which is, I think that it is okay to listen to the market and to be commercially oriented in products in ways that probably would make some folks in some types of product organizations squirm a little bit. And the reason why I believe this is I think there are tremendous businesses built on sales-led motions. And I disagree with the fact that that means you do not care for the craft or the experience of users. I think it can be the best of both worlds.

(01:17:19):
I love sales. I say if I was not in this role, put me on a quota and make me enterprise West. I love to sell, but I think product teams, this opposition we have industry-wide with sales-led I'm not convinced is healthy in every organization. And I was listening to the podcast and I think you all were talking about, you said, "SAP is like this. And who wants to be SAP?" Man alive. There are a lot of companies out there that would love to be SAP, now with a better product, with better experience, with more love from the industry maybe. But what a powerhouse company. And I think we as PMs turn our nose up to powerhouse companies too often because we want companies to be product-led, not sales-led.

Lenny (01:18:07):
Amazing. I'm going to not go deeper into this topic because I don't want to be speaking on behalf of Marty's perspective, but there's so much debate that came out of that episode and I love that it trickles to more opinions being shared about ways product can work.

(01:18:20):
I guess, just to understand your takeaway here, is sales-led companies can be awesome. They can build amazing businesses, and it can be great to be a PM at a company like that.

Claire Vo (01:18:27):
Yeah, and they can build great products.

Lenny (01:18:30):
Great. Claire, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Claire Vo (01:18:39):
I will say, because we've been talking a lot about AI and replacing PMs, I love to sell. I love to help people get jobs, so if there are ways that I can help people find great fit companies, it's one of the things that I get a lot of energy out of. I just want to say that in the world. It's something that sparks a lot of joy. I get a lot of it inbound, "Can you help me get in here? Can you help me get there?" But if there is a tractable way that I can help you get to a connected to a company or a role that you think is great for you, that's fun for me and I'm totally open to it.

Lenny (01:19:09):
How would people reach out to you to try to help you get them [inaudible 01:19:13]?

Claire Vo (01:19:15):
I am, of course, on LinkedIn. I'm on X at ClaireVo, all one word. And then if you really want to go into the archives, I have a very fabulous TikTok where I'm ChiefProductOfficer. It's all one word.

Lenny (01:19:27):
Amazing. We'll link to all these in the show notes. And we will refresh these two facts at the end of the podcast anyway, because I always ask this anyway. Before we do that, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Claire Vo (01:19:28):
I am so ready.

Lenny (01:19:41):
Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Claire Vo (01:19:46):
High Growth Handbook I love, and I like Scaling People. These are two books that the reason why I recommend them to people is because they have solid playbook answers to 80%, 90% of everyday leadership scaling people questions. And so they're just great reference books for what I think great leadership inside startups can look like, and they solve some of the things that you don't need to solve novel-ly. And then one on the fiction side that I've been recommending is Circe, which is a retelling of Circe's story from her perspective. It's a great read, and everybody I've recommended it to really loves it.

Lenny (01:20:28):
From Game of Thrones?

Claire Vo (01:20:31):
No, Circe from the Odyssey. Odysseus [inaudible 01:20:34]. She turns men into pigs.

Lenny (01:20:36):
[inaudible 01:20:36] lack of culture.

Claire Vo (01:20:37):
It's great. My kids are very into Greek mythology, so this is me meeting them on my side.

Lenny (01:20:42):
Amazing. The first two books are both Straight Press. Shout out to Straight Press.

Claire Vo (01:20:46):
Yeah, Straight Press.

Lenny (01:20:47):
And I have both books in the back there, and my laptop's actually sitting on Scaling People.

(01:20:52):
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Claire Vo (01:20:57):
I have kids, so I don't get to go see movies. Movies are, that's an adventure. It's basically a vacation. I saw Poor Things, which if you like capital W weird capital A art, highly recommend Poor Things. The show that I recommend to people, I love Mythic Quest. Everybody references Silicon Valley, but Mythic Quest gets at some of, I was in gaming once, gets at some of my experiences in the technology organizations. It's got a technical female lead and think it's quite funny. I like Mythic Quest.

Lenny (01:21:31):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Claire Vo (01:21:31):
I like to ask candidates how they would improve our business model. I think so many PMs come in with a point of view of the product and the target market but don't actually understand the underlying mechanisms of how we make money and what our unit economics are and how that could be improved. And the candidates that do come in and have a strong point of view on business model often are pretty successful in our organization.

Lenny (01:21:55):
And what do you look for in a good answer that's, "Oh wow, this candidate's great?"

Claire Vo (01:21:59):
It's thinking along the chain of value from how do we identify people in the market? What does our pricing model look like? What could they hypothesize our underlying unit economics or cogs are? And then where are their points of leverage along that whole funnel? It's really, do they have a mental model for thinking about a business model? Have they thought at all about how we make money, either top line or margin? And then can they identify places where they might improve it?

Lenny (01:22:28):
Awesome. Basically understanding the business really well. Great.

(01:22:30):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Claire Vo (01:22:36):
Okay, I'm going to make you laugh because you've gotten all these cars, right?

Lenny (01:22:40):
Yeah, I have such expensive cars.

Claire Vo (01:22:42):
You've got expensive cars. It's not new, I love my minivan. I am a big fan of my minivan. As my friend says, "It's like driving around your living room." And when you have two kids, you know what I want to do? I just want to drive around my living room, Bluey included. And so no Rivian, no Mercedes-Benz, but I really love my Pacifica.

Lenny (01:23:06):
Pacifica? Okay, I was going to ask.

Claire Vo (01:23:07):
But the actual car product that I really love, I love Waymo. We're in San Francisco, we've got these autonomous vehicles. It is, top to bottom, just a lovely product experience from the app to when it shows up, the sound design is great, the cars are comfortable, the displays in the car are great. It is, now every time a tourist comes in, a friend comes in to visit San Francisco, I make them take a round-trip ride in a robot car. And then even I've had a customer service experience with the Waymo team where my friend left an iPhone and [inaudible 01:23:44] and customer experience was great, 24-hour service. Top to bottom, great product design, great service design.

Lenny (01:23:53):
I just got into Waymo actually in the wait list, and so I'm excited to actually try it. I was actually treated as press early on to ride in a Waymo with a person from the company, just to experience it. And then I never got access to it after. Now, I finally can try it.

Claire Vo (01:24:08):
Enjoy. It's so nice. It's my preferred mode of travel.

Lenny (01:24:12):
The future. We've talked about a lot of ways the world is changing. That's another great example.

(01:24:18):
Two questions to go. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family they find useful in work or in life?

Claire Vo (01:24:26):
Fast beats right. Every time when debating between, do I noodle this for a thousand years and try to come to the perfect solution or do I make a decision and get executing and direction I have conviction on, I consistently see and believe that fast at the end of the day, wins. Fast beats right.

Lenny (01:24:51):
Final question. You mentioned TikTok. You put a bunch of awesome content out on TikTok. Any advice, slash is there a tip you could share with someone that is trying to be successful on TikTok from your experience?

Claire Vo (01:25:03):
I've been neglecting my TikTok for a little bit with new job and winter with sick kids. This is my advice, and I think you know this, consistency drives audience growth, which is, when I was on TikTok posting every day, you would get followers and engagement and the algorithm would bless you. And when you don't, you don't. I think consistency in almost all things wins.

(01:25:27):
The other thing that I think is a really good advice for any quote-unquote creator of whatever scale, of whatever ambition, is I think thinking about content creation as documentation, not creative generation is really helpful. I just like to talk about what I think about at work and I like to, an interesting meeting or interesting interaction, document why I thought that was interesting or what could be done better. And that becomes the basis of a very natural flow of content for me. It's a tactic that's worked really well for me and helps me do stuff in my free time.

Lenny (01:26:00):
Amazing. It might be time to start exploring Instagram also with all this TikTok news.

Claire Vo (01:26:05):
I know. Yep.

Lenny (01:26:06):
Claire, before we started this podcast, I asked you what your goal for this was, and it was to be helpful to people. I think we've 100% done that in so many different ways. Thank you again so much for being here.

(01:26:16):
Two final questions. We already covered these, but just to refresh people's memories, where can people find you online if they want to reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Claire Vo (01:26:24):
LinkedIn, X, I'm ClaireVo, all one word. And then on TikTok, get me back into it. Give me a follow, maybe I'll start posting some of my excellent content. But it's @ChiefProductOfficer.

Lenny (01:26:37):
Awesome. And then how can people be useful to you?

Claire Vo (01:26:41):
Help each other. That's what I want the most, which is I do really see, it is a tough time in tech right now and there are a lot of people looking for jobs. One, I think help each other. And then the other thing that I really, if I could ask your audience anything, is if you have a job where your job is typing into an internet box to create products out of nothing, really acknowledge the privilege and joy of that job and try to have some fun because a lot of people want to sit where you're sitting. Have fun. Appreciate what you have. Enjoy it. Enjoy each other.

Lenny (01:27:13):
Great and important advice to leave people with. Claire, thank you so much for being here.

Claire Vo (01:27:13):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:27:18):

# Lessons from 1,000+ YC startups: Resilience, tar pit ideas, pivoting, more | Dalton Caldwell (YC)

## Transcript

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:00):
Seeing everything people apply to YC with. People all have the same idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:04):
One of these themes is simple, pragmatic advice. Sell shit, make money.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:07):
One of my mantras is just don't die. Being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics puts you in the right mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You have this concept of tarpit ideas.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:17):
Seems like an unsolved problem. You'll get all this positive feedback from the world and people have been starting that startup since the '90s.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
Recently you put out a request for startups, 20 categories of ideas and the YC wants to fund.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:28):
We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating they are currently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
A lot of people say you're the king of the pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:36):
A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Are there other patterns you find across startups that do well?

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:43):
There's a lot of founders that come this close to it, all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Dalton Caldwell. Dalton is managing director and group partner at Y Combinator where he's worked for over 10 years across 21 different YC batches, including working closely in the earliest days of Instacart, Retool, Brex, Deal, DoorDash, Webflow, Replit, Amplitude, Whatnot, Razorpay and 20 other Unicorns. Prior to Y Combinator, Dalton was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, which was acquired by Myspace, and Co-founder and CEO of App.net, which was an early ads-free competitor to Twitter. Dalton has seen and worked with more startups than nearly any human alive and in our conversation we get incredibly tactical and deep on the startup journey. Why it all comes down to simply not losing hope and not letting your startup die. What to do when your startup is struggling and how to know when it is time to give up. What makes a great pivot and signs it's time to pivot. How to actually talk to customers.

(00:01:50):
Why every single startup goes through a point where they feel like all hope is lost. Why investors say no to startups. What most often leads to startups failing. Why you need to avoid over-delegating early on. Plus startup ideas that you should avoid. And also 20 ideas Dalton is looking to fund. Also so many great stories and lessons. This episode is action packed. With that, I bring you Dalton Caldwell after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Dalton Caldwell (00:04:45):
Yeah. Thanks so much, Lenny. I'm really excited to talk to you today. It's been great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
So to prep for this podcast interview, I asked a bunch of founders that worked with you during YC what advice you shared with them along the journey that was most transformative to the way they think about product, the way they think about building their startup, the way they operate. And there's a bunch of themes that emerged and I'm going to touch on a number of these themes. One of these themes is just how often you get to very simple pragmatic advice and how much of your message is just sell shit, make money, don't run out of money. Why do you think founders need to hear this advice, which is seemingly simple and obvious?

Dalton Caldwell (00:05:22):
Have you ever seen in NBA basketball or college basketball where they have the coach mic'd up and it shows what they're actually saying in the huddle? You ever listen to what they actually are saying? They're like, "Okay, we need to really focus and get the ball and win this game." If you actually listen to what the greatest, smartest, most successful athletes are talking about, if you listen to what Tiger Woods is saying to his caddy, it all sounds like pretty mundane stuff. It's not like what Tiger Woods is talking about with his caddy is some impossible to decipher jargon. It's like, "Yeah, you really need to keep your head down on this one." It's things like that. And I think the reason this is true is that even if you're in the best in the world, being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics is what puts you in the right mindset and that you already know everything, right? You're at the top of your game if you make it to the elite levels of being a startup founder or basically doing anything that's really hard psychologically.

(00:06:33):
And so yeah, one of my mantras is just don't die. Just keep your startup going. Just keep going. And I say that over and over again and honestly, that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said. It's not that I said some Ninja 5D chess mood that they never would've thought of before. It's just the constant affirmation that continuing to keep going and doing high quality reps is the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:04):
I know that you'd give a talk that's exactly called that, How Not To Die. Just to pull on this thread a little bit more, what is the general advice you share there for people that also don't want to die?

Dalton Caldwell (00:07:14):
The way to summarize that is if you look at all the startup stories that we have at YC and all the companies we funded over all the years, the underlying theme is that rationally the founder should have given up at some point. And so again, let's talk about Airbnb, obviously something you know a lot about. They probably should have shut down three or four times before they got into YC. It objectively wasn't working. They were basically ruining their lives, they were disappointing their parents, everything was wrong and it was a purely irrational act for the founders of Airbnb to keep working on their goofy startup. And again, that's just one story. If you look across the portfolio of YC and non-YC companies, there has to be this irrational intention to keep going even when the world tells you it's not working and you feel completely defeated. And you likely have to go through this many times and have these near-death experiences. And then you get lucky and then you look like an overnight success. Right?

(00:08:26):
And so that is the theme that is a summary and I provide lots of data and lots of stories there, but this is one of those things that the longer I have this job, the more I really, really believe this is true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
What's your advice on the flip side of that where there's a lot of startups, especially these days that are just super struggling, have been added for a while, there are mental health challenges, they'd be very sad if they had to shut this thing down, but often it's probably the right move? What's your advice to folks on deciding, okay, actually does make sense to give up in this case?

Dalton Caldwell (00:09:01):
I think this is a nuanced question and it's hard for me to say something on a podcast that'll actually be useful to people, but here's a couple of thoughts. One, are you still having fun? Do you still enjoy doing what you're doing? Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders? Is this actually a fun thing you're doing? And if the answer there is yes, I would tend to lean on the keep going. And then if it's more of, wow, this is actually profoundly affecting me a negative way and my relationships with people in my life and I don't really want to work with my co-founder anymore and things like that, then I would lean on the probably don't do it anymore. Something that a lot of the folks that turn it around have in common is they actually do love their customers and they love their product.

(00:09:51):
And again, in the Airbnb story, again, you know it really well, but they really liked Airbnb and they liked working with each other and they liked the first host that they met and they knew all their names. You know what I'm saying? They loved their startup even though it was going bad. And so that's to me a signal to keep going is that you really, really love what you're doing and the people you're doing it with and you love your customers and you love the problem. Versus where you're just like, "Yeah, I could care less about any of those things. I'm just having a bad time." Harder to be encouraging in that situation. And this is a fixable situation. You can make it more like the thing you love, can't you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Yeah. This is actually very practical and great advice. This is something people can sense, "Okay, am I actually enjoying this? Do I want to keep doing this?" Versus, "Man, such a drag that I have to keep running this startup." Is there anything you could say to folks that are just like, "I can't stop because it'll feel like I failed"?

Dalton Caldwell (00:10:50):
If it's really going poorly or if you're having a really bad time, it's no big deal. No one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years time. As long as you have integrity, as long as you're an honest person, as long as you handle yourself well through good times and bad, people will remember you fondly. We have such a short life. There's only so many years we get to have our careers, doing something that makes you miserable and the only reason you're doing it is to avoid losing face and you know in your heart is not going to work, I don't know, that seems like a pretty big opportunity cost on literally your life. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
Yeah, that's exactly what I tell founders all the time. Life is short. There's no need to force yourself to work on this. And I really like your point of just, is it still enjoyable? Do you like working with your founders? Following this thread of the struggle training a little bit more, one of the founders that worked with you during YC, his name is Danny Alberson, shared a story how during one of the batches of YC, one of the founders raised his hand and asked you, "What is wrong with our batch? Everyone is struggling, nobody is doing well. What have we done wrong?" And you shared a story about Brex that made everyone feel a little better. Does that ring a bell and if so, can you share that?

Dalton Caldwell (00:12:08):
That definitely happened and I think the story is the story of the Winter-17 batch. And in the Winter-17 batch, I funded something like, I don't know, 35, 40 companies in my group. So we subset them into groups. So it wasn't a lot of companies and I knew all of them really well. And founders can't help but compare themselves with other founders all the time about who's doing well and who's not doing well. And there was this one company in my group, this batch, it was called Vyond, that was their name at the time and it was a VR headset thing from these Stanford dropouts. And they basically showed up to group office hours and were just ashamed and they're like, "Our idea is horrible. We might want to shut our company down. This is really embarrassing." I had to beg them to not give up basically. And if you would've asked people in the batch what the worst company was, I think they would've said this one. Again, not because they were bad people but the founders themselves seemed despondent about how it was going.

(00:13:13):
And then funnily enough, this is in the story too, there was another startup also in my group called Cashew, which was this P2P Venmo, excuse me, in the UK and it was going really poorly also and not growing. And so if you just took this snapshot in time in the middle of the batch of who is definitely not doing well, it would clearly have been this Vyond company and this Cashew company. And so to cut to the chase, Vyond changed their idea and got really excited about it and renamed to Brex and this was Brex, which is like a decacorn. And Cashew changed their idea and renamed to something called Retool. And so out of my 35 companies, the ones that objectively seemed the worst in terms of everything is going bad, were by far, in retrospect, the most successful companies in that group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):
Wow. Wait, so you're saying Brex was a VR headset company?

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:14):
They thought it was really high-tech. They want to do a really high-tech startup, and so they're like, "We're going to build a new VR headset." And yeah, they were good programmers, but they just didn't know anything about optics or the things you might want to be an expert in to build a headset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):
Wow, that's an amazing story. It's a great segue to just another theme that emerged from talking to founders about advice that you've shared. A lot of people tell me you are the king of the pivot of helping people figure out how to pivot. I'm curious just what you've seen makes a good pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:45):
Usually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? And so in the case of Brex, it was they had worked on a FinTech company in Brazil when they were younger, and so I'm like, "You need to work more on the thing all about and not the thing nothing about." And that was what worked for them. In the case of Retool, it was the same thing. They had built similar internal tools both at their internships as well as for Cashew. They had all these dashboards they built to operate their Venmo competitor. And so they knew a lot about what to build in the case of postprod, pivoting and through idea, they knew a lot about analytics and had strong opinions about it. And so it was much closer than what the original idea is.

(00:15:41):
In the case of Zip, Rujul knows a lot about a lot of things and he knew a lot about the crazy picture and process at Airbnb because he worked there. A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you... And it never occurred to you that this thing you know all about would be a good idea or maybe you consciously are like, "I don't want to work on this because burnt out on it." Sometimes someone has to get over this barrier they have on why they don't want to work on a certain idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:18):
These are amazing. I like how modest you are. I'm like, "Oh, here's a big idea." And then you just give very tactical items to look for. So essentially a good pivot in your experience is you're getting closer, warmer towards something you have actual experience in, and two, it builds on something you've done. Can be essentially the core idea of a pivot, right? Where you're...

Dalton Caldwell (00:16:38):
In the example of Segment, which is obviously a really big successful company, they started with something to tell your professor you were confused in class. It was software that they sold to universities. And then they ended up pivoting to something like a mixed panel competitor after two years and it's because they learned about how analytics works running their first idea, okay? And then no one wanted to adopt their mixed panel competitor. And so they were like, "We should make this JavaScript thing that you embed on your website that can send events to multiple endpoints at the same time so that way people would be willing to try our mixed panel competitor side by side with mixed panels to show that it's better." And then they were like, "Oh yeah, no one actually wants that. They just want this JavaScript to send events to different locations." And so there's no way those founders could have started with the final idea. You get what I mean?

(00:17:30):
There was no universe where they would've made up the idea for Segment because they didn't know anything about how analytics worked, but because they were grinding for multiple years and became experts on these things is a side effect of their earlier ideas. They ended up with really good unique insights.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):
I think that's a really important point there is you don't need to necessarily have that experience before you start the company, could come from trying to build the company.

Dalton Caldwell (00:17:51):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
A big question people are always wondering is, should I pivot? Is this the time to pivot? Should I keep trying this idea? What's your advice there of just, okay, now you should really be thinking about something else?

Dalton Caldwell (00:18:02):
Again, this is one of those where I like to give very bespoke nuanced advice on a case by case basis to the folks in YC. But again, just to give you a preview of how I would think about it, I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them. Right? Hey, give it a shot. Again, in the Airbnb story, right? They tried all sorts of stuff including cereal and conventions. They had a bunch of zany ideas on growth and they didn't run out of them. And so I think when there's still gas in the tank on an idea that might be a reason to stay the course. And when literally the founder is like, "Yeah, I don't know, I guess maybe we should pay influencers or something." When that's the kind of ideas they're coming up with, that might be a better sign to pivot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
That is incredibly helpful. Coming back to Zip real quick, they went through I think six different pivots before they landed on this idea that is now a billion-dollar business. Is there anything from that specific journey that you found really interesting? Because they went in so many different directions like accounting, marketplaces and-

Dalton Caldwell (00:19:18):
Yeah. I think in the example of the Zip founders, they were both such great experts and I knew Rujul really well. He actually worked with me at YC as a visiting partner. And so I was really close to Rujul and he had done this marketplace called FlightCar when he was younger, which was raised a series B, it didn't work out, but it was a really cool company. And I had a lot of confidence in his competence on running a business and executing fast and just having great instincts. He really knows the fundamentals and the problem was they weren't as clear on what market to go into, is still with me. And so I actually suggested to do something in their case, again, this is very bespoke, but my suggestion was to start by looking at what companies are publicly traded and/or owned by private equity that are large and that also are hated by their customers, and to try to intentionally find where there's a knowable big market within incumbent combined with the software is horrible.

(00:20:29):
And they did that. They basically found out about all this procurement software and what the state of the art was and that was the prompt. Again, maybe he told you this, that was basically the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):
He did tell me that. I love that example and piece of advice so much. I don't know why more people don't do this. Basically find a large incumbent with very low NPS and try to disrupt them. So straightforward.

Dalton Caldwell (00:20:54):
Yeah, I mean, I can't promise that works for everyone, but again, in the very bespoke situation with Rujul, it worked really well because he actually knew exactly once he locked in on that prompt, oh man, he ran a masterclass. They did an A-plus job, was really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Also Lou, his co-founder, credit to him too.

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:14):
Of course. Sorry. Yeah. We got to give Lou the shout-out. Lou did an amazing job. I just didn't know Lou as well before he did YC. But you're right, we got to give Lou the credit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
I was watching your chat with Michael Seibel talking about pivots and either you or he used this phrase of you want to move towards the mountains in the desert to find the gold of a new startup idea versus the middle of the city. You're unlikely to find gold in the middle of San Francisco. Is there anything along those lines that you can share?

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:41):
Yeah, I think maybe this pertains into what we see from applications and interviews, which is from where I sit seeing everything people apply to YC with and what they interview with and whatnot. People all have the same idea. Basically imagine this, imagine your information consumption where you're listening to the same podcast, wink, wink, you're reading the same people on Twitter, you're reading the same blog post. Basically you have the same information diet of all these other founders and you're friends with all the same people. Does it seem surprising then that you would all end up with similar startup ideas or similar philosophies on what makes a good startup idea? Of course you are. So this is the metaphor on cities is that if you just are following the same principles and have the same information flow into your brain, you're going to come up with the same ideas with everybody else.

(00:22:37):
And so the prompt here is to try to go more off the beaten path either from your personal experience, like in the case of Brex and Retool or Whatnot. There was no one else trying to build marketplaces for Funko Pops. Go deeper in your own personal interests or experience to find something that just your exact peer wouldn't come up with in exactly the same way. And again, the Zip example, I don't think other people were trying to build wonky procurement software. That was not an idea that we saw much of. And so again, the prompt to people is try to mix up what your information diet is or what areas of expertise you have and mine that well, versus just having all the same thoughts as everybody else. And so again, let me give you one more example.

(00:23:24):
A few years ago, startups around trucking were super new and fresh because no one was doing them and they worked really well and then it became completely conventional wisdom to do trucking related startups. I'm not trying to diss anyone, but you'll see things that become fashionable really quickly because someone found success in this unfashionable space and then it becomes fashionable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:45):
This is a good segue to something I definitely want to spend time on, which is you have this concept of tarpit ideas, which are essentially ideas people all gravitate towards and get stuck in and either pivot into and then can't pivot out of or try to pivot out of. And essentially it's just consistently bad startup ideas that people continue to try to start. Can you just talk about this and then what is examples of just bad startup ideas that people should stop trying to start?

Dalton Caldwell (00:24:10):
For people that are familiar with this terminology from us, sometimes they get defensive and don't get what we were saying. By definition it is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea. Do you get what I'm trying to say? A bad startup idea is, I don't know, something that is obviously bad or something where you just can't get any positive feedback on. But some of the most common tarpit would be something like building an app to coordinate with your friends to decide where to go out at night or where to meet up with people, which is really, it's coming from a good place. It's a good idea.

(00:25:10):
If you ask your friends, "Hey, would you like an app for us to coordinate to hang out more so we can be friends?" They're like, "Yeah, I would love that." You'll get all this positive feedback from the world. And man, people have been starting that startup since the '90s and so you can validate it. Part of being a true tarpit is that you can get good initial validation. Do you get what I mean? And so anyway. And honestly I worked on tarpit ideas myself as a founder, which is a music discovery. This is something I did in my first startup. Music startups are hard and trying to be like, "Oh, we're going to fix music discovery." This was classic things where you can get lots of positive feedback and even get users to work on those things, but there are aspects of it that make it a very hard idea. So does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
Absolutely. I'm also guilty of this. I had this startup called Localmind that allowed you to talk to people, check-in in various locations around the city, on Foursquare and Google back in the day and asked them, "How's it going?" And everyone when they used it, they're like, "Holy shit, this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. I could see what's happening at this bar that I'm about to go to." And then they never use it again.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:19):
Do you remember when Foursquare clones was all anyone worked on for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):
Yeah.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:21):
Years?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
They told us Foursquare is going to own this. There's no way this idea you're building is going to be its own thing. And now, yeah, Foursquare is a B2B business.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:30):
Yeah. And all the Foursquare clones, if they didn't pivot out of doing what they're doing, wouldn't have worked. So anyway, that's a tarpit, is just something that's super appealing and a lot of people do it. And then you can get validation and that's why is a tarpit, is it draws you in and you get stuck because it seems like it's a good idea and you get all this positive feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
Along these lines, I was talking to a founder recently and she's asking me, "What causes an investor to say no to you when you're trying to raise money from them?" And I know every investor has a very different perspective on what turns them off to a startup, but is there anything that you find is just like, here, if you do these things, investors will say no.

Dalton Caldwell (00:27:09):
Maybe my best advice here is for founders to put themselves in the shoes of investors and just imagine what their life is like and how if you are in their shoes you would make decisions. And so given this framework, a lot of investors just don't make that many investments and as per what we talked about earlier, life is short. And so there's lots of things that an investor that in their hearts thinks it is pretty good and they're like, "Oh, I like this person and I like their pitch, but I only am going to do a few investments. And so even though I really like a lot about this, I'm going to say no." And I often think that founders think that there's some secret truth that's being held from them on why someone says no or they want more feedback. "I need feedback." That's like, well, the feedback is we didn't want to invest and it really is just that.

(00:28:05):
And so I think if you put yourself in the shoes of an investor of like, "Hey, I only could do a few of these a year, I have very limited budget." They're really just trying to pick the things that they're either personally most excited about or things that they think can be truly phenomenally big in some way. Or again, I know you do investments too, so it's that you only get so many shots as an investor. And so anything that doesn't seem like this is the one, this is the one I want to do is a no. And that that's actually why they're saying no versus, "Oh, you had a bad zoom setup or something. Oh, we didn't like what color your shirt was. We said no." I don't think that's how this actually works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
I think that's such a good piece of advice that it's not necessarily they don't believe in what you're doing, it's they have better options and they're waiting for something that hits the higher bar because they have a lot of options.

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:00):
Yeah. Because again, if you ask someone or put yourself in the investor's shoes, wouldn't you be making decisions the same way? Usually founders are like, "Yeah." If you do that exercise, a lot of this starts to make way more sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Specifically when you're evaluating startups. I wasn't going to go into this, but I think it might be interesting, is market size. How do you think about the importance of large TAM as an investor YC?

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:25):
I think it really depends on what stage you're investing at and it's absolutely critical the later stage you get. Right? If you're going to invest in a very high valuation, it is really important. The earlier you go, the less it matters. And some of the most phenomenally good startups, if you were really pedantic about it, the TAM would be tiny. The TAM of Uber would be nothing, right? The TAM of Airbnb would've been nothing. TI funded Razorpay, which is I think the largest payment processor in India, and the TAM of that was tiny because no one was using credit cards in 2015 in India. So you had to believe that the size of the credit card industry in India would 100X. Well, guess what happened? You know what I'm saying? So I'm not saying that having a large market someday doesn't matter, of course it does eventually. But trying to be super pedantic about market size when it's a pre-seed company or someone applying to YC, it's just not something I'd put a lot of thought.

(00:30:34):
And again, Whatnot. What's the TAM of the collectible Funko Pop industry? I don't know. I don't think it's that big, man. I don't know if you did that analysis when you invested, but I think is pretty small, but I wasn't worried about it. That was the last thing I was worried about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):
It makes so much sense that at YC you don't think about it that much because of, as you said, many startups pivot anyway. So if you like the team-

Dalton Caldwell (00:30:57):
Yeah. And I'm not saying it's not important, it's not... And the things I'm worried about is like, hey, how do you get users? Hey, how do you grow? Things like that. Are you making something people want? Those are the things I'm really worried about as opposed to, ooh, I ran an Excel model and I'm worried this might not be a big enough TAM. That's not the top of my list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:15):
I think it's important to acknowledge that a lot of investors are very... YC I think is unique in a lot of ways where you invest very early and you help people through this journey. A lot of investors are very focused on TAM, so you may find you're getting turned down because they don't think there's a big enough market for you to build a big business, right?

Dalton Caldwell (00:31:32):
Yeah. Or that you're asking them to believe a crazy leap of faith that, again, they could say, "Well, it's theoretically possible you'll be able to sell more than Funko Pops, and I understand that that is your pitch, but I have other opportunities that are less risky." You know what I'm saying? A lot of founders make the argument that the TAM is big, and you can say, "Wow, that's a really interesting argument and I'm not going to argue with you about it, but no, I'm not going to..." And so again, it's hard to get someone to engage in a debate about TAM even if you have some proof points. Ultimately, a lot of investors just don't like that risk. Fair enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:15):
Fair enough. Going in a slightly different direction. So someone else that worked with you, another Lenny, Lenny Bogdonoff who started a company called Milk, and then he was head of growth at OpenAI for a bit. He asked me to ask you about things product leaders and startups should watch out for. Does that ring a bell?

Dalton Caldwell (00:32:35):
I don't remember the specific office hours, but I understand the question and I of course remember Lenny. I think that the advice that he's referencing here is just how important it is to not overdelegate and for the founders to stay close to things, as well as watch out for the trap of hiring super senior people with fancy resumes, really early in a startup. I think that's what he's referencing there. And again, this is definitely one of those very basic things that we find ourselves repeating a lot where they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. Don't overdelegate. We get it, Dalton." And then two years later they're like, "Wow, we overdelegated. We need to go clean that up." So that is probably the best product advice. And the folks that are really great at product, the founders that are always deeply in the weeds on product and still care a lot and are still talking to customers, no matter how late stage it gets, again, I'm sure you experienced this in Airbnb culture, but you can't delegate caring about your users and you can't delegate caring that the product is great. That is so critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:36):
To make this even more real, what is it that you see them do? It's they hire a PM too early, they hire a senior salesperson too early, what are the-

Dalton Caldwell (00:33:43):
Yeah, I think that you get pushed often by investors to hire executives or to scale the team or you raise all this money, you got to spend it, you got to show you're serious about growth and building a world-class organization, whatever, stuff like that. And so you end up with super nice people with super shiny resumes from big tech companies. "Oh wow, they did this amazing thing at Google." And then they hire them and then you wake up one day and you're like, "Oh wow, everything went wrong." It's not really anyone's fault, it's just that you took your eye off the ball and this is what happens to first-time founders a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):
How do you as a founder then have time to do all these things? Is there any guidance you give just like don't overdelegate, don't over hire? But also, you have 24 hours in a day? Is it just find the time, prioritize well, or is there more to it?

Dalton Caldwell (00:34:39):
I think if you just care a lot about your customers and you care a lot about the product, your instincts are pretty good on what to spend time on. And so for example, spending tons and tons of time hanging out with investors and networking, it's probably the thing that I would be cutting. You know what I'm saying? It's what we talked about earlier. If you really love what you're doing, no one needs to tell you how to reprioritize your time. Your intuition will be correct on what you should be spending all your time on, which is being obsessed with product.

Okay, so one of your current colleagues, not former colleagues, Gustav, was on the podcast previously. His episode is, I think, the fourth most popular episode of all time currently, so no pressure.

Dalton Caldwell (00:36:54):
Oh, Cool. Okay. I don't know if I can feed with that. All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:56):
I think you can. So I asked him what is often the most common reason a startup fails? And his answer was they don't talk to customers, they don't find product market fit. They nothing else matters if they can't do that. And so his advice is talk to customers more often. So two questions here. First of all, just is there anything else you would add to why do startups fail? I know we talked about some of these already, but just what comes to mind there?

Dalton Caldwell (00:37:23):
I completely agree with what Gustav said, but to look at this from a different frame, I think is that the founders lose hope. And when you and your heart is like, "Yeah, we're failing." I can see it when I'm meeting with a founder, when they resign themselves that they're failing versus. First is when like, "We got one more move in us. We got one more try." You can see in their eyes when they feel like there's more ideas or there's some last ditch Hail Mary thing. It doesn't always work, but it's almost like you have to not accept that you're going to fail. And as long as you don't accept that that's going to happen, there's usually a lot more moves you can try to save the company. Maybe it's to get profitable, maybe it's to do some other zany thing, maybe it's to launch a new product.

(00:38:17):
And so it's pretty rare, I would argue, that the cause of death is that they had lots of firepower and they were feeling really positive and they just ran out of money. That's actually more rare than founders think. It's much more common that they still have some money left. I'm not saying a lot, but some money and they're just like, "Yeah, I'm done. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to do this anymore." And again, fair enough. But do you get what I'm saying? I think founders are afraid that they're going to run out of money and that's why they're going to shut down. And it's way more common that their idea doesn't work and they have a big fight with their co-founder, and then they can't agree on what to work on, and then they just like, "I don't want to do this anymore." And they shut down. That is the most common cause of death, is something that sounds like that story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
That is so interesting. And again, this comes back to your core advice. Don't die. Just don't die. We talked about this already of just sometimes it's actually okay to die. And I guess just to refresh that lesson is if you're not having fun anymore, maybe it's okay-

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:16):
Yeah, you're out of ideas. You're like, "I'm done." If in your heart that you're done, you don't have to keep going through the motions. No one benefits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
And you've also seen enough cases now, you've shared a few of these where all hope was potentially lost, but they kept going and then they turned into a huge success story. And I think most people don't see those examples. I guess is there anything you can share just how often that happens, how often you see that turn around?

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:41):
I would argue that if we define it as the company had a near death experience where it was going poorly and the founders seriously wondered if it was all going to be over, a hundred percent of the time people go through that where the founder's like, "Yeah, I guess we're done. I guess we should pack it in." And at least you feel that way at some point in your startup journey, man, everyone goes through that. And again, there's gradations, people that actually truly got down to very, very hard situations. It's still a high percentage, maybe 50%. I mean, you can ask founders, there's a lot of founders that come this close to it all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:21):
That is really empowering, I imagine, for many founders hearing this of just knowing every single founder goes through, okay, I think it's actually over. Following on this real quick, the advice that Gustav shared, which is about talking to customers. I'm just going to keep trying to pull wisdom out of your head. Do you have any advice for just how to effectively talk to customers? We're always hearing, "Talk to customers. Build things they want." Easier said than done. You get a lot of asks. You get one customer asking for a lot of stuff. There's a big company that's like, "Build this thing, we'll pay a million dollars." Just do you have general guidance of just what to pay attention to and what to build versus avoid?

Dalton Caldwell (00:40:57):
Yeah, I think when I talked to aspiring founders about this a lot, they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I talked to customers. We get it. Cool." And I'm like, "Cool. Well, how many customers do you talk to?" And they're like, "Well." And they get really quiet. And so I think this is one of those things like, hey, you should have a healthy diet and exercise every day or whatever, where people know it and that doesn't mean they do it. And so I think to start with, you have to get out in the world and talk to people in person. And you can't just hide behind your keyboard and call that talking to customers. Right? I think a lot of folks, the inclinations are to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads and try to get people to sign up for something. And again, maybe that's something, but I think a lot of the reason people do that is they're just shy and they don't want to put themselves out there because it's a little awkward to go talk to people.

(00:41:49):
And you have to set yourself up to go out in the physical world, get people to meet with you, get them to take you seriously, show them a product you're building. And so again, it'd be very tactical here. You can do a self-assessment. In the past month, how many in-person physical meetings have I had with potential customers? Maybe you've done a lot, I don't know, listener, maybe you have, but it's shocking how many companies I talk to, they're like, "Well, we're focused on raising our pre-seed round before we talk to customers." Things like that. And again, I think the core, core thing going on is just social anxiety and looking stupid. And I think you just got to get past that. You just got to start doing it until it doesn't feel bad anymore. Think about how stupid the Airbnb founders must have felt. They were like, "Hey, you should rent out your house and I'm going to come and sleep in your house, and here's an airbag."

(00:42:51):
The whole thing is a little awkward, right? So you got power through the awkwardness of talking to people, and once you start doing it's actually fun. And so once you get used to overcoming this awkwardness, I think people do much better at talking to customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:08):
When someone does this self-evaluation, is there a heuristic that tells you this is enough? What do you look for? Is there a number? How many per week? How many per month?

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:17):
Yeah, I don't know if I know a good number. I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call, meeting with who, meeting with this person. And when the calendar is not that or it's all... Again, what you're actually doing is just buying ads to try to validate your idea, I don't think that's talking to customers. I think that's something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:46):
That's an awesome heuristic. So roughly fifth of your time at least should be talking to customers.

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:51):
Yeah. And again, it depends on the idea space you're working on. Some are more, some are less. So yeah, it should be a fair amount of time. And nothing substitutes for an actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):
Makes so much sense. So the Airbnb is a classic example of they went to New York and talked to their host and things like that. Is there another startup that comes to mind that did this really well, that found just a really cool way and hustle to talk to customers?

Dalton Caldwell (00:44:14):
Well, again, some of the companies we talked about, I mean, for Brex, they were just talking to other people in their batch and that worked extremely well. Same with Retool is they just sold it inside of the YC network. I think with Zip, they were just beasts at getting companies on calls with them to ask them about procurement. And I think they had way more than 20% of their time. When you looked at their calendars, oh man, they were talking to customers a lot to build their first product and pre-selling it before they built it. Same with PostHog I guess that's a different go to market. They launched this open source thing to start with and their calendars are filled with people that were trying to implement the first open source version of PostHog or were so excited about it.

(00:44:59):
And people on Hacker News were excited about it and they had this huge influx of people that were excited that PostHog existed and had lots of feedback and web reports. It wasn't always positive, but they never lacked for people that wanted to talk to them once they launched that, which was very helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):
On Zip, I actually have a lot of their story in one of my series on how to build a B2B startup. And what they did actually, as you know, is they just called, DMed people on LinkedIn and ask them for advice on, "Hey, we're trying to understand how you enjoy your current procurement products." And then they ended up being early beta testers. And I think they did hundreds of these. They just-

Dalton Caldwell (00:45:38):
Oh, yeah, no, it was a numbers game. They were just grinding at this. And so yeah, that was very good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):
The other classic YC stories, the Collison Collision, I think it's called or the-

Dalton Caldwell (00:45:47):
Collison Install.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):
Oh, Collison Install. Okay. Can you tell that story briefly?

Dalton Caldwell (00:45:53):
The Collison Install is what often happens with customers, is that they say, "Yes, I want you buy your product." And then they do not implement it, they just go quiet. There's no implementation and this is very bad if you're selling software to someone. If they never implement it, they're going to churn. You basically failed on the one yard line, okay? And so they developed this tactic to be like, "Oh, well, I'm at the neighborhood, I'll drop by your office to help you implement Stripe and just create..." Again, it was a little awkward like we talked about earlier, but you would be like, "Yeah. I'm in the neighborhood. How about I drop by?" And then they would show up and they'd be like, "Cool, cool. Can pull up your text editor?" "Oh yeah, cool. All right." "Hey, can I drive? Can I have the keyboard?"

(00:46:43):
And they would just install Stripe into the customer's website, smiling, being charming guys. And they'd be like, "Oh, that's cool. Okay. Well, can we roll out the website now?" And they basically would not go away until you finish the implementation of Stripe. And again, it was actually helpful because they were doing all this white glove service to get it implemented. That was very effective. And I think the takeaway from that story is even when you get a yes, you're not actually done with sales. You have to finish the last mile to get the thing implemented. And they were very good at that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:18):
That was an incredible story. And now they're, I don't know, a hundred billion in business and that's how it all begins.

Dalton Caldwell (00:47:24):
Yeah. I was an early Stripe customer at my startup and yeah, Patrick would... We used Google Talk at the time. Patrick would be sending me messages on a weekly basis just checking in. And so again, it's funny how successful these folks get, but yeah, Patrick was very hands-on with all of his customers and was extremely available. I can say that because I was one of them. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):
And I'm sure he had social anxiety going through all that. That wasn't a comfortable thing to do, just keep pushing people to install your software and deploy.

Dalton Caldwell (00:47:54):
Oh, surely not. If you want your startup to work, this is just what you got to do. Comes with the territory.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):
This is going to be just a way broad question and I don't know if you'll have an answer, but just are there other just patterns you find across startups that do well? This is maybe the $64 million question of just founders and what they do that ends up leading to success.

Dalton Caldwell (00:48:15):
I don't think personality types matter as much. I've seen very quiet people, very extroverted people. You name it. I've seen all sorts of personality types. So for me personally, I don't think there's a personality type that people should copy and be like, "I need to be like this person. I need to be Steve Jobs. I need to be Elon." I don't really believe in that because there's just so much variation. Tony from DoorDash is so different than a lot of folks, and Rujul is so different and Grant from Whatnot. These are all very, very different people. Patrick is a different kind of person. Ryan from Flexport. These are just very different personality types. But the thing that I would argue folks that build really big companies have in common is they just really want it and they really believe in themselves and they really believe they can make it work. And that they're somehow deep in their internal psyche, there's something that's like, "I'm the one and I won't accept this not working."

(00:49:26):
And even though objectively there's all this data coming in, this isn't working, this is bad. My employees want to quit, my executives want to quit. Whatever it is. Somewhere deep down in there, they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to make this work. This company is going to be big." And they just believe. And it's almost like that internal gravitational force inside of them is so large, it warps the world to bend to that will. And people start to believe it because they believe it so much and they convince their employees to believe in and they convince everyone around them that this is going to happen for them. And so again, this is not a personality trait. I'm arguing this is a core belief.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:10):
So interesting. And it connects so much to what we've been talking about. Just don't die. Don't lose hope in what you're working on. A founder hearing this might feel like, "Man, I don't know if I'm so convinced this is going to work." In your experience, how much of this is internally, they're so certain and convinced versus externally, they need to show this confidence?

Dalton Caldwell (00:50:31):
Well, I think it's internally they're convinced. Yeah, I'm not sure it's external. But, and this is the big but, no one has this at the early stages when they don't have a good idea and they don't have customers and it's objectively not working. And so again, I know a lot of founders are like, "Well, I don't feel that way. Oh no, maybe I'm an imposter and I shouldn't do a startup." Well, of course you don't feel that way if you haven't talked to any customers and haven't built a product. But what usually happens is you pivot to a good idea where you start with a good idea that you care about and customers you care about and you launch it. And the better the product does, the more obsessed you get with your own company.

(00:51:12):
I think in the case of Stripe, I don't want to tell Patrick's story for him, but I recall him saying at some point he wasn't as sure that Stripe was going to work until they were a year or two in. And then once it started working and then they really believed in it. But it wasn't like he woke up one day and like, "Stripe is the thing. It's going to work." I think you build conviction and you have this network effect virtual cycle where you get work conviction. The more customers reflect back to you and data reflects back to you that you're on the right track.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:45):
This is exactly what Scott Belsky shared in our episode when I asked him when to pivot is, do you have more conviction this is going to work or less conviction over time? And so I like that connection we just made there. Okay, so we've talked about all these way startups fail, bad ideas, tarpit ideas. I want to go to the flip side and talk about good startup ideas. So recently you put out a request for startups, which is essentially 20 categories of ideas that you want to fund, that YC wants to fund. Can you share some of these ideas that you're excited about? And basically you're looking to fund and looking for founders to work on.

Dalton Caldwell (00:52:21):
Yeah. And so we put out the request for startups just to inspire people to maybe apply with ideas that aren't the ones that we always see. It's not prescriptive like we will only fund ideas on this list. It is not that at all. Remember what I talked about earlier with information diet? We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating. There aren't currently. And so a couple of the ones that we put out there, I made one about ERPs which is enterprise resource planning software. And I did that because I get so few applications on that and they're usually pretty good. And I just would love to see more people look at that and learn about what the ERPs are, just because it's so rare that people apply with that. And now I have a feeling we're going to see a lot more applications working on that. And so it worked as intended, which is to introduce this idea space to founders that didn't even know what an ERP was. Now they'll go learn about it.

(00:53:16):
Another one is we'd like to fund open source companies. And so that's one of the RFSs where if more people apply to YC with open ideas, I think we'd be pretty excited about that. Maybe founders didn't realize that that would be something we want to fund. Same with space companies. Yeah, we've had a lot of success with space companies. Several of the folks that are actually going to space right now that aren't SpaceX or YC companies. And so I think sometimes founders feel like those ideas are too bold and ambitious, but no, I'd love if more people apply with space companies. And so think about it that way, where we're trying to put out of idea spaces that perhaps someone subconsciously filtered out as what might be a good startup idea. And hopefully that creates a new set of startup ideation for the person.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
And we're going to link to this page in the show notes for folks that want to explore. I'll give a couple more real quick. A way to end cancer, no big deal. Spatial computing, new defense technology, bringing manufacturing back to America. So a lot of hard science, deep tech stuff, which is maybe a new... I don't know. I imagine you guys have invested this in the past, but it feels like trend.

Dalton Caldwell (00:54:30):
We totally have, right? So these aren't like, "Oh, we've never invested in these before." It's more of like, "Hey, it'd be cool if we saw more applications along these lines." It would be nice because it currently feels a little bit under... There could be more startups working on this stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:46):
Yeah, instead of the tarpit ideas. A couple more real quick, better enterprise glue.

Dalton Caldwell (00:54:51):
Yeah, I like that idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):
Say more about that. What does that look like?

Dalton Caldwell (00:54:55):
The software to connect all these business systems is usually pretty brittle and janky, and there's been lots of good startups founded to solve this problem. I think there's still a lot more room for improvement and likely LLMs will improve. We'll probably be able to create better and better glue so all sorts of software systems can talk to each other. And so again, very broad idea. But yeah, I think we'll see a lot of very successful companies where that's the kernel of the idea they start with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):
Awesome. One last one. Small fine tune models as an alternative to gigantic generic ones. Yeah. Sweet. And so we'll include this link in the show notes and folks can click on each of these and there's a lot more explanation of what it is you're thinking about there. Awesome. Okay, just a couple more questions.

Dalton Caldwell (00:55:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:39):
One is just your background. So from what I've read, in the early 2000s, you were basically hanging out with some of the biggest success stories of today. Folks like Zuck and Reid Hoffman, Sam Altman, Elon, Sean Parker. This is before they really became anyone and they all became very successful. I'm curious just looking back at that, what you've noticed is consistent across these folks that ended up being really successful over time.

Dalton Caldwell (00:56:06):
Back in 2003, being in Silicon Valley and being interested in startups, it was a really small space. There just weren't that many people that were into this stuff. And so I remember I cold emailed Reid Hoffman when LinkedIn was 12 employees and he just responded and he's like, "Oh, let's have lunch." He was just a guy and everyone else that was doing, I guess you could call it social networking, that was the people that I knew. There was a few conferences you would go to and there'd be 30 people there. It reminds me of stories about the Homebrew Computer Club. I'm not saying this is as cool. But when I read stories about what it was like when the Homebrew Computer Club existed, it was a very small number of people that all knew each other that were real weirdo outsiders that were into this stuff, okay? And so that's what in the post.com boom Bay Area startup scene, that's legitimately what it felt like.

(00:57:03):
And so I didn't think a lot about the personality traits of these people. Again, they were all pretty different people, but what they had in common is the folks that are now the really big names just had a lot of staying power. Right? So when I met Sam, he had dropped out of Stanford to work on Loot, which is hilariously a way to find people around you to hang out with. An interesting theme here, huh? He was cool. He was this really young guy and he just did that. It wasn't huge. And then he got into other stuff and ended up working at YC, ended up getting involved in hard tech and has now reinvented himself as the big mind behind AI, which again, awesome. But if I think about who he was back in the day, yeah, he was a 23-year-old working on a thing for feature phones to find friends in your neighborhood.

(00:57:58):
Their customer was Boost Mobile. I bet you could go find the commercials for Loot that Boost Mobile put out on YouTube. Those are actually pretty funny. Have you seen those commercials?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:06):
No, but I'm going to go check them out.

Dalton Caldwell (00:58:07):
Anyway, it's pretty funny. So yeah, that's the real story. And then, yeah, I remember I was in downtown Palo Alto at the time, and some of the folks I was friends with were friends with Sean Parker, and this was actually before Sean Parker went to Facebook. He was part of Napster. And so one of my friends was like, "Oh, we need to get my friend a ride to the airport." And so I ended up giving Sean Parker a ride to the Oakland Airport. And again, what was he like? I don't know. He just basically sat in the back seat on the phone the whole time. But again, my point is I wasn't like, "Wow, these are going to be really big successful people that one day will be important in the world." It just felt like a bunch of nerds that really liked the internet and computers, doing things that they were interested in and were just obsessed with this.

(00:58:57):
They weren't like, "Gee, should I move to New York?" Or, "Maybe I should go to law school." It was people that were very bought in to staying working on internet companies. And so you'll see these folks just reinvent themselves multiple eras, right? Okay, like Reid Hoffman, he worked at PayPal, right? And then he did LinkedIn and then he was a VC. He's had all these different eras where it's the same person, but it's almost like a different figure, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:28):
There's a lot of interesting lessons there. One is that your career is long and you'll have the opportunity to do many things and you can continue to shift. In my example, this is my fourth career, I realized. I was an engineer, then a founder, then a product manager, now whatever this job is. And I think that's really common. I think the other, again, is the personality types point, which I didn't comment on, but I think it's so important that you can be super introverted and be super successful. You can be super extroverted and be very successful. And I think the key there is use your skills and strengths to achieve the same things. You don't have to be the amazing presenter on Steve Jobs type stage. You can do the same thing in a different way. And then the other point there is, again, coming back to you just need to be really excited and enjoy the work you're doing because that'll drive you forward and make you be successful. So I like that the story is a summary of so many of the things you've shared so far.

(01:00:21):
There's other two other fun stories, maybe pick one. The other one is you sold your startup to MySpace and your job was basically to save MySpace. And then the other is you're the reason Andreessen Horowitz missed out on Instagram and couldn't invest. So which of those would you want to share?

Dalton Caldwell (01:00:41):
Well, it's the same story. And the way that it's the same story is my second company... Basically, I sold my first company to MySpace. It was the music company that I worked on. And they recruited a new CEO who was formerly the COO of Facebook called Owen Van Natta. So again, hilariously part of the same little circle of people. And Owen was like, "Okay, we need to fix MySpace. Rupert Murdoch's got the juice. He wants me to fix it. We're going to do it. So come up with some ideas." And the best idea that I could come up with at the time was doing something around mobile photo sharing, something like Twitter, but for photos. And I figured with MySpace's user base, that would work pretty well. This was in 2010, so it was right as the App Store was getting big, and I had a lot of success in the App Store with imeem. It was one of the top downloaded music apps. And so I was like, "Wow, the App Store was really good." And I was really into apps being the thing.

(01:01:40):
And at this time, Facebook was a little early on. They were trying to do cross-platform mobile apps, if you recall. And their apps were not great. This was, again, ancient history. So that was my plan. And then immediately Owen Van Natta was fired, and so I didn't even really get onboarded. And so I just left. I think I worked in MySpace for a month because the person that acquired my company got fired and I think the whole word chart got fired. I didn't even know who to talk to. It was really great. It was a great experience. You know what I'm saying? I wasn't really sure who my point of contact was at that point. I don't think they knew either. It was just a mess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
Just message Tom.

Dalton Caldwell (01:02:19):
No, no. He was long gone. Seriously. I know you're kidding. But no, literally, I don't know who was left at that point. Tom was long gone. And so I was like, "Well, I should just do a new startup and I should work on something like what I was thinking about." And I ended up starting the company and quickly was able to raise an angel around because people remembered my company from the first one. And the major investor we had was Andreessen Horowitz. This is one of their first board seat investments, like Marc Andreessen was on my board. And again, I have my own set of stories about that, but it was interesting experience and we launched it in... I think we got half a million or a million users. You can go find tech print articles about it. We launched on Android and iOS and it was mobile photo sharing, and actually it was growing pretty well. Okay?

(01:03:11):
And then what happened is there was another portfolio company called Bourbon, which was originally a ForceWare clone that was built by these two guys. And they decided to pivot out of that and into what... Which was pretty similar to my thing. Again, fair enough, that's just how this works. And they did something smart. Again, this is just me talking, I don't know what their version of the story is. But what I think they did that was smart is if you looked on the paid app store charts, the number one app was Hipstamatic and Hipstamatic cost money. And what do we know about what people want? They want things that are free that cost money, right? And so they basically built a pretty legitimate knockoff of the Hipstamatic filters, combining it with a social graph, and they launched it and it pretty quickly took off. So of course this is Instagram, right? And so it took off really quickly and that was a wild experience for me to be like, "Oh, this seems familiar."

(01:04:07):
And basically because Andreessen Horowitz had invested in my company, was on the board, even though they were investors in Instagram, that was a conflict and they didn't do the deal. And then for whatever reason, this became a big source of Silicon Valley gossip, which was like, "Wow, I can't believe this happened." And so it was just a really weird experience for me as a founder to be right in the middle of something that became culturally so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):
I imagine there's a bullseye in your back from a16z for a little bit.

Dalton Caldwell (01:04:42):
Oh, I don't actually think they care. I don't think they held it against me because what did I do wrong?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):
It's true.

Dalton Caldwell (01:04:50):
I started a company. You know what I'm saying? Obviously there was some frustration, but I was guy who had a company that they invested in. I don't know. I didn't feel didn't much higher for them. I think this is just how life works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):
Yeah. I wonder if they changed their conflict policies after that at all.

Dalton Caldwell (01:05:10):
I don't think so. I think this has happened multiple other times, but those aren't my stories to tell.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):
And by the way, I don't know if you mentioned the name of your startup, it was called PicPlz, right?

Dalton Caldwell (01:05:21):
Yeah, it's called PicPlz. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:21):
Great. Okay. So for the final phase before we get to very exciting lighting round, I have these two segments, recurring segments. I have failure corner and contrarian corner. We can do both or we can pick one or the other. Failure corner, share a story of a time in your career where you failed and when you learned from that experience. Contrarian corner, what's something you believe that most other people don't believe?

Dalton Caldwell (01:05:45):
Yeah, I think for contrarian corner, I know where I would start and I think it's relevant for your listener. I think this is relevant to this and you could argue this isn't contrary, but here's what I think. I think growth and growth hacking and doing all this analytics, A/B testing stuff, is a total waste of time for very early startups. And that one of the weird things about having lots of startup advice on the internet, again, this is one of the reasons we started making videos at YC, is a lot of the advice was catered towards later stage companies. Like, "Oh, here's how you set up your board and here's how you motivate your sales team." It was all aimed at series A, series B founders, and not for seed stage founders. The problem was seed stage founders would consume all the later stage advice and get really confused.

(01:06:35):
And so the anti-pattern I see is there are lots of founders that are very familiar with your awesome work, which again, I really recommend, I like it. But when you have no customers and you're reading Lenny's guides on how to set up split testing and how you did growth at Airbnb, oh man, that is so dumb. That is so not helpful. And so you see this inclination away from getting a first customer, getting one customer and talking to that person, and instead they have all this really complex growth hacking theory. I think this also happens if you worked in big tech where your product already has scale. And so if you work at Facebook and your job is to launch new little features, yeah, of course you should make heavy use of analytics and A/B testing and split testing and feature flags. Yeah, yeah, yeah, makes sense. But when you have no users, what are you doing? So do you think that's contrary? What do you think? I'm just trying to argue this advice applied to a startup that's too early is actively not helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):
I think it's contrarian for many people. 100%. I also 100% agree with it. It makes me feel like I need to, at the top of my post, share here's who this is for. If you're earlier than this, ignore it. If you're later than this, ignore it.

Dalton Caldwell (01:07:49):
I mean, again, I'm not saying you do anything wrong, but imagine if the OG Airbnb founders took all of your current advice and applied it when they had four users and they knew their names and they were trying to run complicated growth hacking split testings.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:03):
Yeah. Maybe just to clarify when you talk about growth hacking. So obviously when you're starting something, say a consumer app, you need to get a bunch of users somehow. What's your sense of just when you say don't do this sort of thing, but this is okay? What falls in those buckets?

Dalton Caldwell (01:08:20):
I think it depends on the idea. I think in the case of Whatnot, it was consumer app and they needed to get users. But they were very intellectually honest on the metrics for how you get a marketplace off the ground. And they didn't just go dump all their money into Instagram ads. They effectively knew they needed to focus on buyers and on the buy side and build momentum on the buy side. They really understood marketplaces. And so for consumer, I think it's having a sophisticated view of how you get the consumer company off the ground. I think if you look at the Facebook story, them getting a hundred percent penetration on the Harvard campus first instead of launching overall. Again, good strategy, would recommend that strategy. So again, the way to extrapolate that is know what your comps are of what companies you... Or type is, and then look at what they did on the zero to one and ignore what they do today. Right?

(01:09:20):
Don't pay attention to what Facebook does today if you're a brand new startup founder, pay attention to Facebook when they were getting their first thousand users. What were those tactics?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
I feel like this should be its own episode where we just go into how to get your first thousand users. I know there's a video actually we'll link to that Gustav made with YC's advice on how to get your users. Did you want to visit failure corner or not? Or shall we move on?

Dalton Caldwell (01:09:43):
I failed at tons of stuff. As an investor, I make lots of bad investments as well as good ones. I think in my startups I pivoted a lot and a lot of things I did didn't work out. And so again, I just gave you a specific story with PicPlz, right? You just heard a specific story there. I guess what I learned is that you just can't let it get to you too much and you got to keep going. And that if you keep going, no one really remembers those as much and it doesn't really define you. Fear of failure shouldn't dominate all of your thoughts. And instead you should use your energy and positivity to keep trying to do good work, right? Because back in the day, if I would've been like, "Well, I guess startups aren't for me, I guess tech isn't for me." I wouldn't have had a career doing any of this stuff. I wouldn't be working at YC, I wouldn't be advising companies, right?

(01:10:36):
So I always had to have in my life a lot of optimism and energy and use that energy and motor to keep me going. And it served me really well, right? Even if lots of stuff I tried didn't work and continue to not work. Again, obvious stuff I know, but yeah, that doesn't mean it's not true, even though it's obvious.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:58):
I feel like that's a recurring theme here and I love that it's another version of just how not to die. There's the startup itself that shouldn't die, and then there's your just drive and motivation to keep going and try new things when things don't work out. I love all the recurring themes and messages for people here. Dalton, is there anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Dalton Caldwell (01:11:20):
Yeah, I guess the final thought is if someone wants to do a startup and doesn't know where to start, just to give you permission to talk to potential customers and try to pre-sell something before you write code and have those conversations. I think so many folks don't know where to begin on starting a startup, and my tactical advice is start doing customer validation first versus building a PowerPoint deck, versus trying to raise money versus all these other things. I think a lot of people don't use that strategy, and basically if you find people that are really excited and you do line up customers, that is a great green light that it is time to do a startup, right? That can get you down the path. So yeah, I think that's my final advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:09):
And then with that, when does the building come in? Is it build it while you're talking, build it before you... It depends on basically-

Dalton Caldwell (01:12:15):
Build it once you have some conviction and then you're like, "Oh, I think I would have a customer. I think that at least one person would use this thing I want to build. At least one."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:23):
I love it. I love the simplicity and pragmatism of all of your advice. Dalton, welcome to the very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Dalton Caldwell (01:12:33):
Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:34):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Dalton Caldwell (01:12:38):
I think a lot of founders are afraid of doing sales and they don't know how to do sales, and they think they need these really experienced sales coaches and they need all this training, and I'll be like, "Well, go on to Amazon and find the most popular sales books like Getting to Yes that everyone reads, and just read those and that'll get you 80% of the way there." You know what I'm saying? They want to hire someone for millions of dollars to give them sales coaching. I'm like, "Well, have you read these really basic sales books?" And they're like, "No." And so I think that's a low cost way to go on Amazon, Getting to Yes and a few other of the top sellers, I forget the names, and just read those, and that is your crash course on how to be great at sales.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:16):
Awesome. There's also this book called Founding Sales that I imagine you're familiar with. Pete Kazanjy was on the podcast talking about that and that's something I always recommend because it's just like, "How founders can do sales."

Dalton Caldwell (01:13:26):
Start there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):
Start there. Great. We'll link to that. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Dalton Caldwell (01:13:33):
This may be warping what you're asking for, but I like to watch old shows a lot, and so I keep rewatching The Sopranos and the Wire, and it always is different to me every time and things like that. I think here's a silly answer. I've been really enjoying watching old episodes of Columbo, which was a television show from the '70s and '80s. I don't know why, I don't even know if this is destructive, but for some reason, I'm really into that right now. It's very old episodes of Columbo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):
You're an old soul, Dalton.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:01):
I guess. I don't know. It just feels like a time machine to a different time when I watch these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:06):
Definitely, maybe one of the most unique answers yet.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:10):
Fair enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:11):
Columbo.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:12):
Well, again, I guess I'm not trying to give you an answer where I sound super clever-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:15):
No, I love this.

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:16):
I'm telling you the real answer. So that's actually what I'm watching.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:19):
It does actually sound very sophisticated and clever. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask, I guess founders in this context?

Dalton Caldwell (01:14:28):
I don't really believe in trick questions, and I think I just start with, "Hey, so tell me about what you're working on." Or, "What have you learned since you started?" Again, none of these are trick questions, but I think you can get the most honest and interesting answers by asking the most straightforward basic things and having that be a blank slate for their answers to draw on. You know what I'm saying? So I like the most simple prompts and let them take the conversation where they want to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:56):
I know this probably is a very big question, but just what do you look for in their answer that gives you a sense of this is a good or bad answer?

Dalton Caldwell (01:15:05):
For YC interviews?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:05):
Yeah. And I know this is its own podcast episode.

Dalton Caldwell (01:15:08):
I think evidence that they actually have thought about it. As per I said earlier, that they've done research, that they have opinions, that they care about it. Right? Sometimes when people answer questions, you can just tell that it's really superficial, and they haven't put much care or soul into their answers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:31):
Awesome. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Dalton Caldwell (01:15:35):
I like my Oura ring and my Apple Watch and all that good stuff. I've been a fan. There's a YC clinic called SiPhox, S-I-P-H-O-X, I just sign up for, and they do at-home blood testing. And basically I'm trying to sync that at-home blood testing thing into all my other devices. I don't know. I really enjoy all the stuff that Apple and other startups are working on and YC companies are working on around personal health. And so yeah, those are products I'm into.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:05):
SiPhox. Okay. And wait, then you do a needle and stuff and you take your own blood?

Dalton Caldwell (01:16:09):
It's this little tiny needle. It doesn't hurt at all. It takes a few drops of blood and you do it at home and you mail it in and then it has all these blood tests. It's actually really cool. Yeah. It was one of those cases where I saw it and then I later was like, "Oh, wait, that's a YC company." Basically, I became a customer and was pleasantly surprised that it's a YC company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
And I think I found it. So it's S-I-P-H-O-X health dot com.

Dalton Caldwell (01:16:38):
Yeah, it really rolls off the tongue, right? Yeah, that's the name of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):
Very cool. Okay, I see the little needle. Okay, great. Go SiPhox. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life, share with friends?

Dalton Caldwell (01:16:55):
Just check in with yourself that you're having fun and that you enjoy what you're doing. And if you don't, you should probably make a change, whatever that is. And again, if you're a founder, you're in control, right? You can change your own company. But I think a lot of people go through life and they don't ask themselves this question, am I having fun? Am I enjoying? Do I value what I'm spending my time on? And I think that you just can go back to this over and over and over again as a good prompt on how to decide what to do with your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:29):
Easier said than done to change that in many cases, but it always starts with realizing, okay, this isn't actually what I-

Dalton Caldwell (01:17:35):
Yeah, and bidding to yourself. Yeah, I'm not really enjoying this, and then trying to be like, "Well, how can I fix it?" Having that conversation with yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):
Yeah. It reminds me of a Steve Jobs quote where you wake up day after day, it's okay to wake up some days being like, "I don't want to be doing this." But if it's every day and continues to happen, then that's a sign you should change it.

Dalton Caldwell (01:17:53):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:54):
Final question. You and Michael Seibel have been doing this incredible podcast together. If somebody wanted to check out the podcast and dive in, is there an episode that you love most that you think they could start with?

Dalton Caldwell (01:18:05):
It depends. Some of the episodes are more for folks that already have a startup and they're dealing with problems. I don't know. Some of the episodes about investors or things like that. It's very clear that the audience for those is current startup founders. And there's a lot that are just more life advice, how to make decisions and think about. And those have strangely become very popular and gotten a lot of views with non-startup founders, which is a pleasant surprise. And so I'd recommend those for folks in the audience that are not currently startup founders. I don't know. Life tips from top founders, I think is a good-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:41):
Oh, from billionaires? Is it that one?

Dalton Caldwell (01:18:43):
Yeah, yeah. I think that was pretty popular. So what I'd be looking for is diagnose, am I a current founder and I have founder problems? Or am I just looking for general philosophy type questions? And I really like those philosophy ones. We have one for high school students, the audience is, here's advice for high school students that are interested in startups. Here's some tips that you should be thinking about. Again, pretty narrow target audience, but I love that episode because we're really trying to speak directly to that audience and I think it's pretty good advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:13):
Dalton, you are wonderful. Thank you for sharing so much wisdom. This is action packed. I'm really excited for founders to listen to this. I think it's going to make a big dent in a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on some of this? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Dalton Caldwell (01:19:27):
I am on Twitter/X.com and Dalton.C is my username. And also my LinkedIn is pretty good. It's pretty popular. I don't know. Just search for my name on LinkedIn. And yeah, I'd love to see you all there. And then how can folks be helpful? I mean, honestly, it's just great when folks want to apply to YC and do a startup. And so feel free to dive into other videos and apply to YC. And something that's really special about my job is I get the privilege of getting to fund companies that they already know me from videos and they're shocked that I'm exactly the same as... Effectively, they're like, "Wow, you're just that guy from the videos I've been watching, and it's so cool that you're just exactly like you seem in the videos." And so basically, yeah, if people like what I have to say and they like the videos and apply to YC, I would love to fund their companies.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
The business you're building, the team you're building, the way you're operating is the very bleeding edge of how companies are trying to operate in this AI era.

Dan Shipper (00:00:07):
We have a head of AI operations. She's just constantly building prompts and building workflows that I and everyone else on the team are just automating as much as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
What are some things that you believe about AI that most people don't?

Dan Shipper (00:00:20):
I hate the headlines that are like, "Entry-level jobs are taken away by AI." Whenever I see a kid with ChatGPT, I'm like, "Holy shit, they're going to go so much faster than any other person that I've worked with." We have this guy, he made a year's worth of progress in two months because every time I sat down with him and told him, "Okay, here's how you tell a story, here's how you think about a headline," he recorded all of it, put it into a prompt, and he never made the same mistake twice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
There's this sense we're getting to a place where you don't have to write any code, you have a product team not writing code at all.

Dan Shipper (00:00:46):
No one is manually coding anymore. Organizations like ours, people who are playing at the edge, we're doing things that, in three years, everybody else is going to be doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):
Today, my guest is Dan Shipper. Dan is the co-founder and CEO of Every, which is a company that is at the very bleeding edge of what is possible with AI. Their team of just 15 employees has built and shipped four different products. They publish a daily newsletter, and they have a consulting arm that helps companies adopt the latest AI best practices. On their product team, their engineers don't handwrite a single line of code and instead use an arsenal of agents who help them craft requirements and build their products.

(00:01:22):
Their editorial arm uses AI to publish better work faster, and they even have a person whose entire job is to help every employee at the company become more efficient using the latest AI workflows. In our conversation, Dan shares a bunch of tactics that they use internally to increase the leverage of their own employees, his personal AI tool stack, the one predictor that he's found for whether a company will successfully find huge productivity gains through AI, how he's building his company in a really unique way, a bunch of predictions for where AI is going, and so much more.

If you're an engineering leader or on a platform team, at some point, your CEO will inevitably ask you for productivity metrics.

(00:03:24):
But measuring engineering organizations is hard, and we can all agree that simple metrics like the number of PRs or commits doesn't tell the full story. That's where DX comes in. DX is an engineering intelligence solution designed by leading researchers, including those behind the DORA and SPACE frameworks. It combines quantitative data from developer tools with qualitative feedback from developers to give you a complete view of engineering productivity and the factors affecting it.

Dan Shipper (00:04:11):
Thank you for having me. I've obviously been a huge fan for a long time and so it's an honor to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:16):
It's my honor, Dan. I feel like this is a podcast that was meant to be. I'm so happy we're finally doing this. There's so damn much that I want to talk about; there's so damn much we can talk about. I thought it'd be fun to start with just some hot takes.

(00:04:29):
And the reason I want to start here is I feel like you spend more time thinking about AI, building with AI, using AI, evaluating AI than anyone else I know nearly. And so I really respect your insights and your perspectives on where things are going. So let me just ask you this question and see where this goes. What are some things that you believe about AI using AI tools that most people don't believe?

Dan Shipper (00:04:55):
I'm going to go with my hottest take, and this is the take that I have the least evidence for. So let's just start with that. I have other more well-reasoned takes to give you, but this is my hottest one, which is I think that AI may be one of the biggest force for reshoring American jobs. And so I think everyone is worried about it unemploying people. And for sure, it will change the skills needed to do the jobs that you're doing, but I think it may actually reshore a lot of jobs, and it'll do that in two ways.

(00:05:27):
One is, there are a lot of expensive services that rich people and big companies are paid for right now, so in-house counsel or call center or whatever. And what cheap intelligence does is it makes those kinds of things affordable for small companies and individuals. So it stimulates demand. The other thing that it does is it allows people who are in those jobs to serve more people cheaply. It may not get rid of customer service, for example, but it may allow 10 people in the Midwest, who would normally be working at a call center, to serve hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Maybe that's too much, but a lot more people than they would ordinarily if they were the ones on the phone all the time.

(00:06:22):
And so it becomes much more cost-effective for American companies to hire people in the US. And I think the people in the US are going to be better, in a lot of cases, at using these AI tools to do work. So I think it may actually make it more effective to have those jobs in the US run by people sitting in the US who are using it to get work done. And also, the model companies are here too. So there's a lot of American stuff happening, and you can decide whether or not you think that's a good thing, but I think it's quite lost in the conversation over whether AI will get rid of jobs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):
I like optimistic takes about AI, so this is great. And to your point, TBD if this is good for other countries, but good for the US. What else? What else you got? What other hot takes?

Dan Shipper (00:07:10):
Okay. Another big hot take, and this is less contrarian and more just, I think, people are truly sleeping on it. I think people are truly sleeping on how good Claude Code is for non-coders. And I'll extend this to not just Claude Code, but Google just came out with the Gemini CLI command-line interface. So things like that. And I'll tell you for people who are listening that don't know what Claude Code is. Claude Code is just the command-line interface. It's those black terminals that programmers use. It's a command-line interface that you can boot up. It has access to your file system, it knows how to use any kind of terminal command and it knows how to browse the web, all that kind of stuff.

(00:07:47):
You can give it something to do and it will go off and it'll run for 20 or 30 minutes and complete a task autonomously, agentically. Especially with Claude Opus 4 that just came out, it's this gigantic leap forward in AI's ability to work by itself. And Claude Code can even spawn multiple sub-agents that do a bunch of tasks in parallel and it's incredibly useful for programmers. Everybody inside of Every is using it all day, every day. Everyone's agent-pilled. They've got 15 agents doing all this kind of stuff. It's crazy.

(00:08:18):
But non-programmers don't use it because it's intimidating to use the terminal. But for example, you can download all your meeting notes and put it in a folder and just be like, "Okay, I want you to read every single one of my meeting notes and tell me..." Something that I do, for example, is, "Tell me all the time that I subtly avoided conflict."

(00:08:38):
And it writes a little to-do list for itself. It can have a little notebook, it can go and read each little thing and then write into its notebook, go down its to-do list and give you a summarized answer over multiple turns. So it's not just stuffing everything into context, which is what you'd be doing with ChatGPT chat or a regular Claude chat. It's actually processing every single file that you give it. And so I think it's incredibly powerful for any kind of task that involves processing a lot of text.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:06):
So as a simple way to think about this, you basically have an agent on your local computer that can read your local files and do your bidding.

Dan Shipper (00:09:14):
Yes, exactly. And it can do that for long amounts of time without going off the rails.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Interesting. And so there's a small hurdle that non-technical people have to overcome, which is using their terminal and giving commands, but once they get it running, it's just you talk to it in English and ask it to do stuff.

Dan Shipper (00:09:32):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:33):
So the hot take here is just Claude Code, which most people think is for engineers, is the most underrated tool for non-technical people.

Dan Shipper (00:09:42):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):
What are some other ways you imagine people seeing this? This meeting note example is really cool and I could see people using this. What else have you seen or thinking about?

Dan Shipper (00:09:52):
Something that I've done a lot, so I'm a writer for a lot of my job. And I know you're going to ask me about books I love, so I'm going to give you a sneak peek, which is I love War and Peace. I just read it for the third time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:03):
Wow, that's a long book.

Dan Shipper (00:10:06):
It's so long, but it's so good. I think Tolstoy is a brilliant writer. And one thing that I wanted to do is I was like, "I want to inflect some of my writing with some of Tolstoy's style." And the way I did that is I think he's incredible at these little subtle sentences where he shows you what a character is thinking and feeling just by how they behave, how they move their face or the mismatch between the intonation in their voice and the expression in their eyes, all that kind of stuff. He's just an incredible student of human behavior and psychology.

(00:10:36):
And so I just downloaded War and Peace to my computer, which you can do because it's public domain. And then I had Claude read the first three chapters of War and Peace and pull out all of those descriptions, and then make a guide for itself for how to do character descriptions like Tolstoy. And you could totally do this with a regular Opus command, but you couldn't put all of War and Peace into it. It would take a lot more hand holding to get it to do this. And it just did this by itself without my really intervening.

(00:11:05):
I had it download a Russian version of War and Peace and the English version, and then start comparing different scenes that I love to tell me about things that I might've missed in the translations, so that you can get as deep and weird and nerdy for whatever subfield you care about as you want to. Same thing for if you've got tons of customer interviews or tons of customer data you want to go through, it's incredibly powerful for going and figuring stuff out from big data sets like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
You actually inspired me to use... This is not what you're describing, but it's also something that's very cool. This is going to sound so nerdy. I'm reading Anna Karenina right now.

Dan Shipper (00:11:40):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:41):
Also Tolstoy. And this is recommended by a previous podcast guest. And so I was like, "All right, I got to read this." Also very long. I'm on my Kindle, I'm just like, "All right, 13% in, I've been reading for months."

Dan Shipper (00:11:52):
Hot take, I think War and Peace is better than Anna Karenina, especially for a tech person. But they're both good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
Okay, there we go. There's my year. I saw you tweet this use case that I love that I've been using, which is just while I'm reading, having ChatGPT voice sitting around and then just asking it questions. Because you don't actually have to feed it the book, it knows the whole book. And Anthropic just shared this. I don't know if they shared or someone found this in their legal briefings that they actually bought tons of books and scanned them themselves, is how they did fair use.

(00:12:23):
And so it has all this context. So just sitting there and asking it, "What the heck is this thing in Russian society?" is super fun. Okay, so this is awesome. So the tip here is just coming back to your hot take. The tip is you basically can have an agent using local files and doing all kinds of cool stuff on your computer versus having to upload it into projects or into your prompts and things like that. Super cool. So the bet here is that people are going to discover this and start using this just day to day.

Dan Shipper (00:12:53):
I think they absolutely will. And I also think probably the model companies are going to start making this more accessible. I think one of the things that will just come from Claude Code and other things like it into everything else you use, whether it's on the web or wherever, is all of the original AI apps were pasting a chat box into an existing UI. So you've got Copilot, it's got the auto-complete in the IDE. You've got Cursor, it's got a little sidebar with a little chat. And the difference with Claude Code is you never look at the code. It's not meant for coding, it's not meant for coding by hand.

(00:13:34):
It's meant for you to say, "I want you to get something done," and it goes and does it. And I think we're just getting to a point where for pretty much all the usual applications, AI is going to be good enough that we can get rid of the interfaces more or less where you're digging into all the things that it's actually doing and you're interleaved with its execution and you're more just like, "I'm delegating, it's going to go do it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:58):
Yeah. I had Cursor's CEO, Michael Truell, on the podcast, and this is his big vision is, "What comes after code?"

Dan Shipper (00:14:05):
English.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:06):
Exactly. Exactly. I also just had the founder of Base44 on the podcast who built this company, sold for 80 million bucks to Wix. And he shared that he's been around for six months, the company. For the last three months, he hasn't touched a single line of front-end code, all Cursor and other tools he's using. So this is happening.

Dan Shipper (00:14:27):
Same thing for people inside of Every, no one is manually coding anymore.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:32):
Okay. Definitely need to talk about that. Before we do, any other hot takes that you want to throw out there?

Dan Shipper (00:14:38):
I have one other hot take, which is I have a definition for AGI. And so AGI is famously hard to define. What does it mean for it to be artificial general intelligence? The Turing test was one, but we'd pretty much blown past the Turing test in a lot of ways. So we have no good one. And so what I have noticed is that you can tell how much better AI is getting by how long a leash you can give it to do work.

(00:15:09):
So with Copilot, you can tab complete and that was the beginning. With ChatGPT, you ask it a question and it returns a response and that's maybe slightly better than a tab complete. And then now with Claude Opus 4 and Gemini and all that kind of stuff, also with deep research, it can go off and work for 20 or 30 minutes. So that leash is getting longer where you have to intervene.

(00:15:34):
And I was thinking about this and it reminded me of Winnicott, who was a child psychologist. He wrote this book called Playing & Reality. And his conceptualization for what it means to become an adult, what it means to go from being an infant to a child to an adult is when you're first born, you're effectively fused with usually your mother, your caregiver. There's no difference between you and her or you and whoever your caregiver is.

(00:16:02):
And growing up is this process of being gradually let down in certain moments where you can handle being let down. So you learn that there's a separation between you and your caregiver. So for infants, it's instead of being fused at the hip for every hour of every day, you get left alone. Maybe you get left alone to cry it out. Who knows if that's the right thing to do with infants? A lot of consternation there. But that's teaching you that there's a separation between you and your mom or you and your dad. There's not going to always be someone to pick you up.

(00:16:38):
And raising a child is about knowing when they're ready to be let down a little bit and have to stand up on their own. So I think there's that same leash with human development. You get longer and longer periods of time where you can be on your own. So we're still in the 20 to 30 minutes is maybe... I don't know, you probably can't leave a toddler alone for 20 or 30 minutes, but it's a little bit older than a toddler.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:02):
Maybe 20, 30 seconds.

Dan Shipper (00:17:06):
With a toddler, you can be in the same room but not interacting with them every single second for 20 minutes sometimes. So it's around there. I think we have that similar leash with AGI. And so I think a good definition of AGI is when does it become economically profitable for people to run agents indefinitely? So it just never turns off. It's a Claude Code that's always running, it's always doing something, you just never turn it off, and you don't need to because you know that it's worthwhile to keep it on.

(00:17:41):
It's never waiting for you to be like, "Okay, next thing." It'll always respond to you when you're like, "Okay, next thing." But it's off just essentially living its life like a teenager and that is profitable for you. You'd rather have it do that than just wait for you to tell it what to do next.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:56):
Interesting.

Dan Shipper (00:17:56):
I think that's a good definition of AGI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
The profitable piece is also just the cost of running that thing and having it.

Dan Shipper (00:18:02):
It's partly the cost and partly the value. And obviously, you can game this a little bit and be like, "Cool, I'm just going to tell Claude to run in a loop forever." But I'm talking about more than that, more widespread adoption of agents that work all the time. And I like the profitable thing, because if it costs a little bit of money and the bar is profitability, it has to actually be doing something useful for you to keep it on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:29):
It's interesting how the metaphor of a senior employee and autonomy and essentially the more autonomous they are, the less instruction you have to give, the less reviews you have to do, is also just directly correlated with how senior they are.

Dan Shipper (00:18:44):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
Okay, great. Anything else along these lines?

Dan Shipper (00:18:48):
I have plenty of them. I hate the headlines that are like, "It's going to replace jobs," or "It's going to unemploy two thirds of the workforce." I don't think that's true. I hate headlines that are like, "You don't use your brain when you use ChatGPT," or another good headline is, "Doctors alone, doctors plus AI, or just AI, which one is better? AI is better, therefore, doctors are going to be outmoded."

(00:19:18):
All that stuff is, I think, pretty dumb. So for the doctors plus AI example, I think it's important to recognize that using AI is a skill. And so if you study doctors in a vacuum that don't really have a lot of experience with AI, you could probably create a situation such that it's better to just use an AI. And sometimes it is going to be better. But there's so many contexts that doctors need to make decisions and do things that it's really hard to take one study and make any conclusion about that.

(00:19:52):
And it's especially hard when you're dealing with a technology that's developing so rapidly that doctors can't really be expected to be experts at it yet. But I would guess in five or 10 years, that will be totally and completely different. For the student example or the "AI turns your brain off" example, I think it's really important to understand that in the history of technology, it has always been the case that you give up certain skills in order to get other ones. For example, Plato is famously very skeptical of writing because he thought it would harm your memory. And it did. We don't remember things quite as well as they did back in the day because they had to remember long epic poems to entertain each other.

(00:20:37):
But I think writing is a worthwhile trade for having a slightly worse memory. And I think something similar is going on with AI where you may be slightly less engaged in certain tasks, but if you use it right, you're going to be way more engaged in other tasks where you have much more power. And so you can construct a study that says brain connectivity goes down when you use AI in the same way that you could construct a study that says people's memory are worse when they have writing skills. But I don't think anyone would want to go back to a world where no one was literate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):
That is super interesting. There's all these studies that are showing the benefits of AI to students with these studies in Nigeria and just how fast people progress. So I think it's really important, this context you're sharing that you will lose some things, but the hope is the gain is much higher, and so far it seems like it will be.

Dan Shipper (00:21:27):
Yeah. I think people always, especially at the beginning of a tech hype cycle or a revolution paradigm shift, it's always easy to underestimate how quickly things are going to change. And the example I always use is, I live in Brooklyn and the tailor down the street from me doesn't accept credit cards. Credit cards have been around for a long time, so it takes a long time for technology like this to be adopted even in the best case.

(00:21:55):
And I think it's really easy to underestimate how complex specific contexts are that humans know how to deal with. And just because you can get a really good score on a test... It's incredible. I love AI, it's so incredible, but it doesn't actually give you an intuition for how difficult it is to actually be replacing specific parts of work or activities that you would do. I think a really good thing to give you maybe a little bit of an intuition for it is I built this thing over a weekend a month ago that was, "0.3, can it predict what I'm going to say in a meeting?"

(00:22:45):
That's a benchmark. It's the CEO benchmark. And the reason I did that is because the gold standard for OpenAI for testing how powerful a model is, is they test it on their internal code base. So they say, "How good is the new model at predicting what comes next in our internal code base?" Because that's not anywhere out on the internet. So it's a really good benchmark for that. And so I was like, "Well, my meeting transcripts aren't anywhere on the internet. A lot of what I say is on the internet and there's some overlap, but it'd be interesting."

(00:23:19):
And so I ran a bunch of the frontier models on this, on just my Granola transcripts, and they're pretty bad. They are pretty bad, and it's not because they're not smart. There's this real push now. Tobi from Spotify coined this term called "context engineering," which is getting the context to the model, the right context at the right time, is at least half the performance.

(00:23:43):
And I think that's 100% true. It's something that I've been writing about for three years. At the time, I called it knowledge orchestration. I think context engineering is probably a better term. But it's totally true, and that's a very, very hard problem to solve. It's not just a one- shot problem where it's gigantic context window and we're done. It's going...

Dan Shipper (00:24:00):
... that problem, where it's like gigantic context window and we're done. I think it's going to get better over time, but the minute it gets good at predicting what I'm going to say next in a meeting, I'm just going to use it as a tool, and that's going to change the entire dynamic of what I say next in a meeting. So it's not as easy as it seems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:18):
Interesting. I imagine you can build a GPT from that. And then, instead of having a meeting with Dan now, just talk to this thing, and he'll make decisions.

Dan Shipper (00:24:26):
Yes, definitely. And I mean we do this a little bit. It's not the same as being able to predict exactly what I'm going to say in a meeting. But I think if you're a CEO, or founder, or manager, it's really stunning how much of your job is just repeating yourself. And that is one of the best things about this AI, particularly AI revolution, is that you don't have to repeat yourself.

(00:24:48):
And so we had it last quarter. I tend to set one or two quarterly goals. And one of my big goals for us last quarter was don't repeat yourself. So I don't want ever say the same thing in a meeting twice, if I can help it. So for us, at Every, one of the big parts of Every is we have a daily newsletter. And I'm spending a lot of time giving feedback on headlines, or giving feedback on, "How do you write an intro," or "Is this idea any good," that kind of stuff.

(00:25:15):
And we've started to codify all of that into prompts that basically... It's not the same as mimicking me. It can't exactly say exactly what I'm going to say in a meeting, but it pushes my taste out to the edge so that writers who are not able to talk to me, by the time I see it, they've already talked to some simulation of a simulation of me. And that's incredibly powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:41):
Let's follow this thread. This is exactly where I want it to go. I feel like the business you're building, the team you're building, the way you're operating is the very bleeding edge of how companies will operate and are trying to operate in this AI era. You guys are trying to be super AI-first. And it's super aligned with just so much of your writing. There's just so much reason to study what you guys are doing. So-

Dan Shipper (00:26:04):
Well, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):
Yes. And this is benefiting all of us, so thank you. So first of all, just tell people what the heck Every is, and then share a few insights into just how you operate. It's funny that you laugh at [inaudible 00:26:20] whatever you say.

Dan Shipper (00:26:20):
Everyone asks that because it's a very weird shape of a company. You can actually see other companies that have this shape from earlier eras, but it's less common. It doesn't make as much sense.

(00:26:33):
And I think it's newly enabled by AI, and we can talk about why. But the way that I typically talk about Every is we do ideas and apps at the edge of AI. So the core of the business is we have a daily newsletter. We've been doing it for about five years. We have about 100,000 subscribers. All of the people from the top AI labs read us. Anyone who's basically interested in or working in AI at the frontier and wants to know what's on reads us.

(00:27:00):
We do a lot of... For example, whenever OpenAI or Anthropic drop a new model, we get our hands on it early, and then we get to play with it and write about it, which it's my ideal job. I love it. It's the best.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:14):
It sounds like it.

Dan Shipper (00:27:14):
I don't if I can curse on this podcast, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):
You can.

Dan Shipper (00:27:15):
... it's the fucking best.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:18):
Perfect. Excellent use. And you call those "vibe checks", is that the-

Dan Shipper (00:27:22):
Yeah, we call them vibe checks-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):
Vibe checks, love those.

Dan Shipper (00:27:24):
... which I think is really important because... And this gets to the next part, the apps part of what we do. I think it's really important to do vibe checks and to call them vibe checks because they're about how does it feel to use this thing and how does it feel to use it for work for things that you would normally use it for in your job or in your life. Because I think that captures something that standard benchmarks just don't capture and really can't. And the best people to tell... to write a vibe check are people that are actually at the edge using it for stuff.

(00:27:57):
And so what we've found over time is we have... We love, we think the best writing and content about technology is from people that are actually using it and building with it. And so we've always had this sort of function, where we're always building little experiments in addition to our writing, and that helps us write great stuff. And that has turned into a suite of apps that we run internally. And the people who are building those apps are also writers, and they're contributing to things like vibe checks.

(00:28:27):
So you get a really inside look into how is this stuff being built from people who are actually using it every day. And the suite of apps that we have, one's called Cora. We just launched Cora publicly on the day that we're recording this, which is really awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:39):
Congratulations.

Dan Shipper (00:28:40):
Thank you. You can think of it like a chief of staff, an AI chief of staff for your email. It helps you manage your email with AI. It's very cool. We can go into more of it later. We have another one called Sparkle, which is an AI file cleaner. We have another one called Spiral that does content automation with AI. We originally incubated Lex, which is an AI document writer, which we spun out into its own company, and my Every co-founder runs that.

(00:29:05):
And basically we bundle everything together. So you pay one price, and you get access to all of the software that we make, and we're constantly putting new stuff in the bundle. And I can tell you more about what kinds of things do we like to incubate and how do we like to incubate it because I think there's some really interesting, special things in there.

(00:29:21):
But I've been blabbering for a while, so I'll stop there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):
There's also a consulting firm, which I want to talk about, but let's hold off on that.

Dan Shipper (00:29:25):
Yeah, we have consulting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (00:29:27):
We also do that, and that's the third leg of the stool in the business. It doesn't fit quite as nicely into my ideas in app streaming, but we spend a lot of time with big companies, where we teach them basically how to be AI-first. We train all the people on how to use AI. And it's very cool, it's really fun, and a very important part of what we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:47):
That feels like a billion-dollar business right there. I want to come back to it.

Dan Shipper (00:29:50):
[inaudible 00:29:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:51):
Because everybody wants to learn this.

(00:29:53):
Okay, so share a few ways that you guys operate. You mentioned that your team doesn't write any code. What are just some ways that allow you to operate this efficiently? I know your team's really small. You have a daily newsletter, you have three, four products, you have a consulting arm. How big is the team at Every?

Dan Shipper (00:30:10):
We have 15 people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:11):
15 people? Okay.

Dan Shipper (00:30:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:12):
So just give us insight into some of the ways you operate that are at the bleeding edge.

Dan Shipper (00:30:16):
Okay, so a couple of things. One, and I think everyone should do this, is we have a head of AI operations. I sit with her once a week. And every time I'm doing something repetitively, we put it in a to-do list. And she's just constantly building prompts, and building workflows, and stuff like that so that I and everyone else on the team are just automating as much as possible. And I think that has been a big unlock because it's really hard to...

(00:30:44):
If you're working in a job all day, you're fighting fires, and you're like, "Okay, am I going to do this in the way that I know how or am I going to do it in the new way that might not work?" I don't want to spend a bunch of time [inaudible 00:30:54] you're building some no-code automation. I don't want to do that. And having an AI operations lead lets you basically identify those things and have them solved without people who are doing the work actually having to take time to do it, which I think makes it much more likely it happens.

(00:31:10):
There's always a trick with that, where it's like you have to make sure it gets used. So it's basically you're developing little applications internally, but if you're good at making applications people use, it's great. Highly recommend having an AI operations lead.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:23):
I imagine you saw the [inaudible 00:31:25] Quora tweeted about this, wanting to hire exactly this sort of person.

Dan Shipper (00:31:29):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:29):
So clearly this is a trend.

Dan Shipper (00:31:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:31):
So the idea is your point that this needs to be somebody who's outside of the day-to-day work of the company, and is specifically focused on helping the team be more efficient with AI?

Dan Shipper (00:31:43):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):
And then is this person mostly just you automating you, or can they help other people? Are they helpful-

Dan Shipper (00:31:49):
No, she helps everyone, basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):
Everyone? Okay.

Dan Shipper (00:31:51):
Where we're starting right now is with the editorial operation. So there's so much stuff in the editorial operation, where I or our editor in chief, Kate... Kate, is constantly doing little, small copy edits to make sure everything is in Every style, and it takes hours a day. And so now Opus is at a point where you can give it a style guide and a prompt, and it will go through anything you're writing, and copy edit it, which is amazing.

(00:32:24):
The trick is it's not just building that. You also have to get Kate to be like, "Did you put this through the prompt yet," anytime someone gives her something. So there's a little bit of behavioral update too that has to happen, which I think is a really interesting organizational challenge.

(00:32:38):
And I think for us it's a little easier because everybody inside the org is very AI-first and just wants to go do it. We don't have anyone really who's like, "I don't know. I don't really want to do this." And that's a whole different challenge, which I think a lot of organizations face, but there's always a problem of getting people to use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:55):
That is super cool. What is her background, this AI operations person?

Dan Shipper (00:32:59):
Her name is Katie Parrott. She actually does a lot of ghostwriting for us. So she also, when people inside of Every who are builders... Often they just write themselves, but sometimes they want help, and she'll help them write about whatever they're working on. So that's how she started with us. She still does that, but she also spends a lot of time doing the AI operation stuff.

(00:33:20):
And then before that, she worked at Animalz, which is a content marketing agency, one of the top content marketing agencies. And they're very process oriented. And I think the reason Katie is so good is because she's incredibly good at that kind of process stuff or thinking about that, but she's also a great writer and she's also just incredibly excited about AI. She just wants to tinker and wants to use it. And that was the thing that got me to be like, "Okay, you should just come and do that. Instead of just ghostwriting, we should add this to your plate." And it's been really fantastic.

(00:33:58):
At minimum, you really just want someone who's just like, "I want to tinker. I want to build stuff." There's also people who have a little bit more of that process orientation. I think that is important. And to the extent they understand the craft of the thing that they're trying to build for, that also helps a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:14):
This is an amazing tip. I feel like everyone's going to start hiring these people.

Dan Shipper (00:34:17):
I think so. There's a couple other people who talk about this. I heard Rachel Woods, who's another... She thinks a lot of AI stuff. She's talking about it. I think it's becoming a thing, and I think it's really important, and it just bleeds out into every other part of the org.

(00:34:33):
So we're doing this inside of the editorial org, but there's a lot of copy that goes out on Cora. And by the way, Cora is spelled C-O-R-A, so it's different from Q-U-O-R-A, slightly confusing. There's a lot of copy that goes out on Cora, or Spiral, or Sparkle that we want to have that same Every quality bar for. And so we have engineers sending Kate, like, "Here's the Figma file. Can you go and do copy edits?" And that sucks for everybody. And Kate is one person, and it's just really hard to do that.

(00:35:04):
So one thing that we did, Nityesh, who's one of the engineers on Cora, built a Claude Code command that just uses that prompt, and checks through the entire code base for all the copy edits, and then creates a pull request on GitHub, and then sends the pull request to Kate. So she's just looking at the pull request, and being like, "Does this make sense?"

(00:35:26):
And so you can translate that prompt into, for example, a format that engineers can use. And suddenly your engineering team is writing marketing copy in the style you want. I think that's so cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:36):
That is extremely cool. I'm going to take us on a little tangent. You keep mentioning-

Dan Shipper (00:35:42):
[inaudible 00:35:42].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):
... Claude, and I'm curious just what is in the stack of tools that you find yourself using, your team ends up using. It seems like Claude is a core part of it.

Dan Shipper (00:35:51):
I do love Claude. I would say I'm generally... My first thing that I open is o3. I'm a ChatGPT boy. And I think o3 is super high quality. I think it's great for writing, it's great for coding, it's great for all that stuff. And what it has that really makes a difference still from Claude is it has memory. And I just love that. I've spent so much time yelling at ChatGPT about, "I need my writing to be punchy and concise." And it just knows that now.

(00:36:20):
So I think when I ask it to write something for me, it's actually better than yours. Or maybe not yours, but your average ChatGPT user. And I also find I use it a lot for self-reflection and personal growth type stuff. So it knows me. So when I send it a meeting transcript, and I'm like, "How did I do?" It's like, "Well, you did that thing that you normally do, but you're way better on this other thing." And I like that. I think that's really great. So day-to-day, o3, that's my go-to.

(00:36:49):
I think Claude Opus is... First of all, Claude Code, everyone inside Every, that's basically what we use. If you're building something, you're using Claude Code. It's crazy. It's so good.

(00:37:01):
Gemini just came out with something, so I'm very excited to try that because I think that's the model that we use most for the apps that we build, inside the apps. It's incredibly powerful and it's incredibly cheap, which is great. So I want to try the CLI tool that they came out with.

(00:37:17):
We also use Codex a bit, which is OpenAI's coding tool. And that's for, like, "I want a one-off, self-contained... I want to pick off this little feature."

(00:37:27):
What else do I use? Going back to Claude, Claude Opus 4 can do something that no other model, except one other model that I can't talk about... can do something that no-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
[inaudible 00:37:39].

Dan Shipper (00:37:39):
... other model can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):
Okay, we won't go there. We don't want to get you in trouble. Okay, go on.

Dan Shipper (00:37:44):
But yeah, no other model can do this. Which is earlier versions of Claude, and I think generally versions of other models, when you ask them, "Is this piece of writing any good," Claude, for example, would always give it a B+. And then if you did another turn of the same conversation, you're like, "I updated this," it would always go to A-. And then if you give it another turn, it would go to A.

(00:38:07):
So it doesn't have the same kind of gut. It's thinking about what you probably want hear too much. And there's various methods that you can use to prompt engineer around this, like give it a template or whatever. And they sort of worked, but it just still doesn't have that thing where it's like, "Can it tell if writing is interesting or any good? Does it have that gut sense?" And Opus 4 has it. It's really wild. And I think that's super important because it opens up all these use cases where you might want to use a language model as a judge. So for us, for example, we're working on a new version of our product Spiral, which does content automation. You've used that in the past. And we're doing essentially Claude Code, but for content style product, where you say, "I want it to write a tweet," you give it all the documents, it has a bunch of memories, it creates a to-do list for itself, and then it goes and writes.

(00:39:04):
And one of the things that is so interesting is now, because it can judge things, part of its to-do list is, "Okay, I wrote three tweets. I'm going to judge whether I think these are any good," and then it can improve before it comes back to you.

(00:39:21):
And that's just a huge, huge unlock, that we were struggling for three months to build this crazy system to try to get it to judge writing. And then Opus 4, just one-shotted it, and we're like, "Great, this product works. Let's start chipping it." So yeah, I love it for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):
Are there any other AI tools that you just use regularly? You mentioned Granola, even outside of the bottles. So what are some that you think maybe people are sleeping on?

Dan Shipper (00:39:46):
I use Granola. So I used to use Super Whisper and Whisper flow, which I think are fantastic. We have an internal version of that called Monologue that will be shipping in a month or so that I use now, but you can think of them as roughly equivalent. And I think generally speech to text interfaces are the future, and more people should be using them, and more people should be building them as affordances. We use Notion all the time, and I specifically use their meeting recording. I think that's mostly the stack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:17):
Okay. That was really helpful and super interesting.

(00:40:20):

(00:41:28):
Let's go back to ways that your team operates. You mentioned having Kate. Was that her name?

Dan Shipper (00:41:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:33):
Okay. What else? What else do you do that you think other companies should be doing or will eventually start doing?

Dan Shipper (00:41:39):
So the Cora team, which is Kieran and Nityesh, basically-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:43):
[inaudible 00:41:43] that's the team, two people?

Dan Shipper (00:41:44):
That's the team, yeah. Well, with Cora, it's Kieran, Nityesh, and 15 Claude Code instances, so it's more powerful than you think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):
I love that. This is just, again, a glimpse into the future.

Dan Shipper (00:41:58):
One of the things that we do that I think is really cool, and they basically invented this, I had nothing to do with this, is they invented the idea of compounding engineering. So basically, for every unit of work, you should make the next unit of work easier to do.

(00:42:16):
So an example is, in a Claude Code world, where you're not coding a lot, you end up spending a lot of time essentially typing PRDs. Like, "Here's a document with exactly the stuff that I need to do," right? And so you could just be like, "Okay, cool. That's my job now. I'm going to just write PRDs." And so each successive PRD, it's the same amount of work.

(00:42:45):
Or you could spend a little bit of time being like... There's a sort of platonic ideal of a PRD. And what I'm going to do is write a prompt that can take my rambling thoughts and then turn that into a PRD. And so you spend a little bit of work to make all of the next PRDs that you're doing easier to write because you're writing less of them.

(00:43:08):
And so finding those little speed-ups, where every time you're building something, you're making it easier to do that same thing next time, I think gets you a lot more leverage in your engineering team.

(00:43:20):
And so, yeah, we have Kieran and Nityesh. And Cora, it just became public. It was in private beta. It had 2,500 active users. And there's millions of emails going through it. And that's one of the products that we do as a 15-person company. It's kind of crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:37):
It is crazy. How do you do the speed-up thing? Is it prompts that they continue to refine [inaudible 00:43:44]?

Dan Shipper (00:43:44):
A lot of it is prompts, and automations, and stuff like that. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:47):
Got it. For automations, what's the tool? What's the tool you use for automating automations?

Dan Shipper (00:43:52):
What they're using a lot of is Claude Code. So you can do slash commands in Claude Code, which are repeated prompts that you're doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):
Got it. Okay. So basically they're building a library of prompts that make the process, of, "Here's what I want to build," to a good solid PRD that you can feed into Claude Code more correct and more efficient?

Dan Shipper (00:44:13):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:14):
Super interesting. And they just keep a file or they put this into a project? Is that how they store this stuff?

Dan Shipper (00:44:14):
It's a GitHub. It's a GitHub GitHub-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):
[inaudible 00:44:22].

Dan Shipper (00:44:22):
... where they can share it with each other.

(00:44:24):
Another thing that they do, which I think is very cool, is they use a bunch of Claudes at once, but then they're also using three other agents. There's an agent called Friday that they love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:36):
That's an AI Asian product called Friday?

Dan Shipper (00:44:38):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:38):
Hadn't heard of that. Okay, interesting.

Dan Shipper (00:44:40):
There's another one called Charlie that they really love. And in particular, I think the thing they like about Charlie... We have a whole video about this, which I can send to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:47):
Yeah, I'll point to it.

Dan Shipper (00:44:48):
They did an S-tier through F-tier of AI agents, which I think is so funny. And one of the things I really like about Charlie is that it lives in GitHub, so when you get a pull request, you can just be like, at Charlie, "Can you check this out?" And that seems to work really well to have different agents that have maybe slightly different perspectives. It's like different people that have different perspectives and have different taste.

(00:45:15):
Kieran, he's one of those serious Rails-files, who they just love Rails, and they love the way that Rails feels, and so I think he has a real sensitivity to... Okay, this agent, ChatGPT for example, it feels very terse, and minimal, and professional, and it has a particular kind of style that maybe he likes. Versus, I don't know, Claude is a slightly different style. And I think all of that is so interesting that these things have personalities, and that that changes what you might want to use it for or why you might want to use three of them at once.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):
That is so fascinating. It makes me think about Peter Deng's conversation again, where he talks about his hiring strategy and one of his key lessons. And he ended up hiring the current head of product for ChatGPT, the current head of marketing at ChatGPT, the current head of engineering because he hires these incredible people.

(00:46:07):
And his philosophy is to hire a team of Avengers, where everyone is strong at certain things, and together they're the perfect team, versus everyone... versus the best at everything. And it's interesting that you can almost do that with different product, different agents from different companies.

Dan Shipper (00:46:22):
You definitely can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):
And it makes me feel like there's a bigger market than people think potentially, where people will want different companies, agents, not just all Devins or not all Codexes.

Dan Shipper (00:46:30):
I think there really is. It's definitely not one agent to rule them all at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):
So interesting.

Dan Shipper (00:46:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:36):
Oh, my God. The two people on the Cora team, what's their background? Are they both engineers or what are they?

Dan Shipper (00:46:42):
They're both engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):
Okay.

Dan Shipper (00:46:44):
Kieran's got this crazy background, where... They both have really interesting backgrounds. Kieran's got this crazy background, where he was previously VP Eng at a startup, so was effectively the CTO of a startup, or maybe two startups, and was one of the founders. But before that, he was a composer, a professional composer. And before that, he was a baker. So we did a team retreat in France last year, and he taught us all how to make croissants. My croissant was horrible. His was beautiful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:14):
Seems [inaudible 00:47:16].

Dan Shipper (00:47:16):
And generally, I think that kind of multidimensional type of talent is the kind of person that I love having at Every. Because we're all generalists. We all want to use AI for all these weird, awesome, creative things. And someone who has that background is going to have a good taste for not only agents, but, "What should the landing page look like," or whatever. Which I think is increasingly important, where you're trying to scale a team of generalists of 15 people to five products. So that's Kieran's background.

(00:47:43):
Natasha's background is... I'm jealous because he only started learning to code when ChatGPT came out. He had wanted to learn to code forever, and he's only known how to code in an AI era. And I keep telling him, "Dude, I learned to program in middle school from books." I had to go to Barnes & Noble and buy a book. And there was nothing... I couldn't Google any-

Dan Shipper (00:48:00):
I had to go to Barnes and Noble and buy a book and there was nothing... I couldn't Google anything about why this function wasn't working.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:08):
No Stack Overflow even back then.

Dan Shipper (00:48:10):
Yeah, yeah. There wasn't that overflow. There was weird BB net forums and stuff that I was like 12 and I probably shouldn't have been on there or whatever. So he has gone so much faster than any other engineer, I think in a pre AI era. And I see the same thing in the rest of the company. I think there's this huge question about what happens when kids... Entry level jobs are taken away by AI. And my take is like that's worth thinking about and it's possible that that might be a problem at some point. But my take is whenever I see a kid with ChatGPT, I'm like, holy shit, they're going to grow so much faster than any other person that I've worked with. We have this guy Alex Duffy who works with us, he writes for Context Window and he just launched, we taught AIs how to play diplomacy with each other, which is really cool.

(00:49:08):
And he did that whole thing and I think he's really, really, really talented. And when he came to us, I guess almost a year ago now, it was one of those classic cases which I've seen over and over at every... Which is, you have great ideas, but you're not a good writer yet and it's really hard for me to do anything with you until you're good enough at it. So I have to give you small little things until you get better and blah, blah, blah, whatever. And what I noticed with him is he was just making a year. He made a year's worth of progress in two months because every time I sat down with him and told him, okay, here's how you tell a story. Here's how you think about a headline. He recorded all of it, put it into a prompt, and he never made the same mistake twice.

(00:49:49):
And I think he's so much accelerated from where he would have been because of this stuff, and I see that in lots of other parts of the work. So Natasha is another good example. And so I think generally people are going to figure out that some 20-year-old with ChatGPT subscription is super powerful if you just mentor them. And I think that's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:11):
Man, there's so many threads I could follow here. There's all this fear of entry level people will never... The roles are disappearing for entry level people and so how will we ever have senior people if these people can't learn to do things as an entry level person? And what you're saying is ChatGPT and these tools help you accelerate really quickly so you don't really need to be at the bottom rung for a long time.

Dan Shipper (00:50:33):
Yeah. You're effectively learning how to be one level above the entry level from the beginning and this is sort of my whole allocation economy thesis where when you look at skills are going to be valuable in the AI era, one big group of skills are the skills of managers. Today, they're human managers, tomorrow everyone's a model manager. Right now, AI is not... Right now, management skills are not broadly distributed, because it's very expensive, another expensive thing that... So 8% of the workforce is managers. It's now going to be much cheaper to manage, so more people are going to have to do it. And so that's the thing that kids, 20-year-olds, whatever, I see is now are going to start to have to learn in addition to, it's not like you can just say, okay, go do it and then come back. You have to be able to go into the work that's being done and help make it better. But they're learning both at the same time. They're learning how to manage and how to do the actual work so that they're good at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):
And the managing here is managing agents. Right?

Dan Shipper (00:51:41):
Yeah. You're managing AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:43):
And so coming back to your point about how this core team, and I guess you said everyone doesn't write code, zero code written, now it's just managing agents that are writing code for you.

Dan Shipper (00:51:54):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):
Okay. I've never heard of a company at this stage, so this is extremely cool. So the workflow is they give it, here's what I want. I refine it using this cool prompts library that they build on and agents build code, write the code. Then basically the time is spent reviewing code and then reviewing the output. What does it look like? What does it feel like? And then continuing to refine, wow. So you guys are at where Michael from Cursor said we will be. So I chatted with him a few months ago. He said in a year, this is where he thinks the thing will be. We're not looking at code anymore. You guys are already there. Although you were looking at code. Okay, you're still looking at code.

Dan Shipper (00:52:33):
They definitely are looking at code. So you're doing a code review before you do anything. And I do think Danny, who runs Spiral, which is the cloud code for content tool I was talking about that we're building, he spent a couple of days digging into the internals of some third party library that we were interested in just because it's helpful to know, it's helpful to understand those things, but then he's not actually writing any code. Once he understands it, he's just off telling cloud code what to do. And I think that's really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:08):
This is an insane milestone we're hitting here. There's this sense we're getting to a place where you don't need to really understand code, you don't have to write any code. We'll get there and you guys are there. I think this is so easy to overlook how wild this is. You have a product team not writing code at all.

Dan Shipper (00:53:26):
It is really wild. I think it's really wild in particular, just having a small group of people that have... Everyone has all these different skills. Everyone's a generalist, everyone's AI forward. So what you can do in an environment like that with just still a small team is crazy. And you're kind of inventing all these new principles for how do we work together, how do we do engineering, all that kind of stuff. And I think that's what makes the writing... That's why I like doing that is because the writing that we do from that I think is really good because we can talk about it from a sort of position of experience, but I do want to say something else which is we're not at a point yet where the people that work at every could do what they do if they didn't know how to code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
Yeah, this is what I was going to ask.

Dan Shipper (00:54:10):
Which is a different bar, and I think for a long time it's going to be valuable to know how to code for a long time, but this is a progression that is not a new progression. So for example, when I was in middle school learning to code, the new hot thing was scripting languages, which is Python and JavaScript. But if you were a real programmer, you would understand the language underlying Python and JavaScript, which is written in C. and scripting language weren't totally real. And in order to really do anything interesting, you had to be able to learn both parts of the stack. Same thing for C programmers, when I guess in the seventies C was invented, it was like you got to be able to write assembly.

(00:54:59):
And English is just a layer on top of scripting languages. So I think all of those things were right in the sense that there's... Especially during transitions, there's a lot of reasons why it's important to be able to go down a layer in the stack and it gets less and less frequent over time, but that still takes a long time. And there's some times when even if you're a JavaScript or a Python programmer, it's useful to know how that stuff works, how it's written, and see how it's implemented. Today it's much less important than it used to be, but that took 10 or 20 years. And I think that the same thing is going to be true for programming. Having that skill is super important and will accelerate you significantly. It will sort of start to get less important over time, but we're not close to that yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):
Okay. That's a really important point. I'm glad you went there. So do you have a sense of how far we might be from you hiring someone to build another product that isn't an engineer?

Dan Shipper (00:55:54):
Like a real SaaS product?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):
So hey, we have this idea we want to bring someone on to actually lead it.

Dan Shipper (00:56:00):
Very far. Not within sight, but there's a lot of things that could be products that are a level down from that I think that you could do almost now. So an example, we were talking about DIA, the new AI browser from the browser company. DIA has these things called skills, which are effectively little AI apps that you can run in the browser. You can prompt them and they run on the web page and do work for you. A non-technical person can build that, same thing for custom GPTs from ChatGPT. A non-technical person can definitely build that. So I think while I will definitely maintain that we're not anywhere close to anybody being able to build a conventional SaaS app with zero programming knowledge, aside from just a demo, there are going to be other forms of software.

(00:56:55):
One of my things is like software is becoming content. There's going to be other forms of software that don't look like the software today, but you can run, start and run as a business, as a non-technical person even if you don't know how to code. And that'll happen very soon. I mean, it's already kind of happening. It doesn't look like the thing that you're asking about. It's sort of like the difference between a Hollywood movie and a YouTube video.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):
I think that's really reassuring to a lot of people. Basically what you're seeing is AI just supercharges people who have a skill and allows them to do a lot more.

Dan Shipper (00:57:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:26):
Okay. Is there any other way that you guys operate that is really interesting that might be worth sharing that helps you operate really quickly, helps you do more with less?

Dan Shipper (00:57:38):
I mean, I would love to talk about how we think about building products, what products to build, what do we end up building? Because I think that there's something sort of special about it that probably there's a playbook that is useful for people. So when I think about... This is only sort of snapped into focus recently. So a lot of this was just doing it intuitively without really a thought for it. But when I think about the kind of things that we have ended up incubating, it's basically goes back to something I said at the beginning, which is there are these things that were historically really expensive that only rich people or big companies could buy. So a chief of staff for your email, I think a therapist or a lawyer is another interesting example. Someone to organize your closet or organize your computer is another example. Someone to go straight for you, that are becoming orders of magnitude cheaper so that everyone can use them even if you're at a small startup.

(00:58:39):
And so basically when you're running, we are sort of this AI first company. You're running into all these little things where you're like, I wish I had a ghost writer right now, but ghost writers are really expensive. Or I wish I had a lawyer but it would cost me like $25,000. Lawyers are really expensive and there's a lot more demand for those services than can be fulfilled because they're so expensive. And what AI does is it allows you to be like, oh, I could just use cloud for that. I can use ChatGPT for that. And so you're able to use the demand that you have that we can afford a lawyer. We have ghost writers, but there's a lot more that we can't do because we can't afford it. So we still have our lawyer and we still have our ghost writers, but we just do a lot more of that stuff.

(00:59:27):
And so we notice that. We start to then use ChatGPT and cloud first, these general purpose tools to try it and see is this useful? Does this actually work? All that kind of stuff. And then if it does, we will unbundle it into its own separate thing that becomes an app. And I think what's really special about this time is the entire game board has been totally reset in terms of things you can build. Where five years ago it was like you're going to build another Notes app. We've been building notes app for forever, another B2B SAS app. It's all the same stuff in slightly different packaging. And now it's totally new territory. No one knows what's going on. Everyone's inventing it as it happens. All these new workflows are being created in a very similar way to, I don't know, for example, when spreadsheets were first a thing on computers, we were figuring out all these new workflows on spreadsheets.

(01:00:24):
They got unbundled in the B2B SAS, same thing for ChatGPT and Claude. And what's really cool is you can be like, cool, I'm using using ChatGPT for this. It's really useful for me. And you might be one of the first people to really notice that. And then because everybody that works at Every is AI first and came to us because they reads Every, they read Every, so we all have the same vibe and we're all kind of doing similar stuff. They become our first users. So we measure the success of the product by is it a banger inside of Every, monologue the app that I was talking to you about, everyone just started using it and we're like, okay, we've got something here.

(01:01:05):
And what's really interesting then is if everyone inside of Every uses it and people read Every, they have a similar vibe to us too, so they become the next set of users. And that's a really, I think, interesting pipeline for building applications or building apps. It's a totally new greenfield so that all the stuff you're thinking about, it's probably new, which is really cool. And over time, what I think is organizations like ours, people who are playing at the edge, we're doing things that in three years everybody else is going to be doing. So it may be kind of niche for now, but it will be a big deal in three years when everyone else has the same needs that we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:45):
That is really cool. What I'm hearing is GPT wrappers are a good idea and are worth building.

Dan Shipper (01:01:50):
100% thank you. GPT wrappers are amazing and they've been much maligned for absolutely no reason and people don't understand how absolutely valuable they are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:03):
I think there's also just you guys raised a sip seed round. This is a good time to maybe talk about that. Just these products don't have to become some mega-billion dollar hits. You kind of have this portfolio of companies, you have the content business. So I think there's a really interesting approach to how big these need to get to be successful. Maybe just talk about that.

Dan Shipper (01:02:25):
Yeah. I really want Every to be an institution that teaches people how to live a better, more human life with technology, particularly with AI. And both teaches them how to do it with writing and the content we make and then builds tools for them to do that. But I think fundamental to building an institution is, at least for me, the way I would like to do it is I want internally it to feel like this creative playground where we have the opportunity to take risk and do stuff and do weird stuff that just doesn't make any sense. We can't justify anyone, but we just feel like it would be fun. And so I think I'm always playing with that dynamic tension between institution serious, we want this to be lasting and important and it should just be fun. Let's play around. And I think having that tension is really valuable.

(01:03:16):
And so I've always been sort of hesitant to raise a lot of money because I think it locks you into having to be that serious thing that's totally going for it. And there's lots of companies that figure out that balance. But just for me personally as a founder, I'm like, I want to keep the optionality alive and I want to keep the kind of playful feeling alive. And I think part of that comes from I know I have the control to do what I want more or less. There's probably also some deeper psychological things going on there, which I'm happy to talk about if you want to get into it. But I think there's also just... That's what I want. And so when we started Every, we raised a very small 700K pre-seed round, and this was at the height of the creator economy.

(01:03:59):
So we both started our newsletters. He and I started our newsletters around the same time. It was the hypest, craziest thing. People were throwing money around. It was wild. But we raised 700K because it was like, I want to raise enough for us to be able to experiment, have a little cash cushion, but not so much that it locks us into anything. And we sent an email to all of our investors being like, and you're one of our investors, so you've probably got this email.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):
Tiny investor. But I'm in there, I'm in there.

Dan Shipper (01:04:26):
We sent an email to everyone being like, this is probably not a venture business, so you should not expect us to raise again. And we even raised on this slightly modified safe that gave everyone the option to convert to equity in three years, even if we didn't raise more money. So we did it in a way that allowed us the option to get really big and do the traditional thing and also the option to do it the way we want to do it. Maybe it's not a huge business, but we love it. That's great. And we did the same thing for this recent round where we raised up to 2 million from Reid Hoffman and starting line VC. And we did it as what I've been calling a sip seed round, which is basically they've committed $2 million, but we can pull it down whenever we want and we just do it on a safe at a set cap.

(01:05:12):
And for me, that's really helpful because it allows me psychologically to take a lot more risk. If we go to zero on the bank account, I can get more money. Great. I don't have to think about it. But what's also really helpful is I'm not, and the rest of the team is not staring at a gigantic number in the bank account being like, cool, we can burn this. Let's burn it. And also for our investors, I think Reid very much wants us to succeed, but I don't think he cares what size of business this is. I think he's more philosophically aligned with the thing that we're trying to do. And if it becomes a huge business, he's psyched for it. And I think that kind of alignment is what I was looking for. I think there's this core creative spirit to the thing that I want to maintain and I really care about having a big impact.

(01:06:03):
But I think there's a lot of ways to have an impact. And one of them is building a $10 billion business. I think another way is really changing how people see the world, see themselves in the world. And I think that's what stories do. And you don't necessarily... Sometimes you do that by building a gigantic company, but you don't necessarily always have to do that. A lot of the stories that we care about most are from people who maybe they weren't rich at all. And so I really like creating this place where we can make a really good business. And I care a lot about that. But also the core of the soul of it is about changing how people see themselves in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
I love that you've kind of innovated a new middle ground way of fundraising, not bootstrap and not just regular VC. It's a seed. And I love that this two... If I raised 50 million, it'd be like, okay, I get it. Let's not put 50 million in our bank account, but you do have 2 million. It's too much for us. We don't want to see that in our account.

Dan Shipper (01:07:01):
That's another thing. And we'll see how this ages. I might be back here in two years crying the blues because we didn't raise enough money or whatever. Who knows? But that's the other thing is I do think we can get so much further with very small amounts of money. Like Cora, I think all in to build Cora, we've spent maybe 300K, Maybe. That's crazy because-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
And that includes salaries?

Dan Shipper (01:07:27):
Includes salaries. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:27):
Wow.

Dan Shipper (01:07:28):
This product was not even technically possible even if you had billions of dollars three years ago. Not possible because you can't do email summarizing and automatic responses and all that kind of stuff without GPT. So not only was it totally impossible, but now we can get with two engineers, we can get the amount done that would've taken a team of 20 people. And I think that means that we need less money. And I don't think that VC has really caught up to that yet. And I think there are other companies that are doing... There's a term called seed strapping, so there are other companies that are starting to wake up to this too. And I'm curious about how it changes the VC model. For sure for us, we have a specific incubation model, which is a bit different from a VC model. And I think there's some differentiation in the stuff that we can do with founders, which is kind of cool. But yeah, I'm just trying to figure out a shape that works for me and that's different from other people and we'll see how this goes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):
We'll revisit in a couple years. Seems like it's going great from the outside. I'm going to ask about a couple other things before we wrap up. One is around this consulting arm that you have. I think it's really interesting because like I said, I feel like this could be a billion-dollar business. I feel like every company right now is trying to figure out what the hell's everyone else figured out that we're not doing. I've had so many emails from chief product officers at companies being like, can you introduce me to some chief product officers that have done cool things with AI that we should learn from? So many people and I would just introduce them to each other and it's cool because you guys are basically solving that problem for a lot of companies.

(01:09:18):
So one is just maybe share a bit about what that side of the business for folks. And then two, I feel like I imagine you've seen companies that have done this really well, have adopted AI, things have worked really well, they found really good productivity gains, and then you found companies that don't. What do you find is the difference between those two?

Dan Shipper (01:09:35):
I love this question and I have a very specific opinion about this. So one, yeah, the consulting arm, basically we spend all of our time playing around with new models, writing about them and building stuff with them. And we have a big audience. So naturally we've gotten companies over time being like, can you just come and teach us how to do this? And so we started to do that. This is pretty nascent. It's probably been over the last six to nine months, but it's a pretty big business now. It'll probably double this year. Last year we did about a million. Maybe it'll be more this year. We'll see. It depends on a couple... We have a couple of big contracts out, so it might be way more than that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:13):
A billion. I predict a billion dollars in a few years.

Dan Shipper (01:10:17):
But yeah, basically people are like, can you come help us learn how to do this? So what we do is we spend some time going and researching your organization. So we go in and try to understand what are all the different teams doing, what are the repetitive tasks, some of the stuff we were talking about earlier. And then what we will do is first we present a little report, tells you here's everything that we found. Here's not only that, but you have a chatbot where you can chat with all the interviews that we did and you can pull out your own insights. We have a whole dashboard where it shows you, here are the teams that are really into this, here are the teams that are not. Here's how much leverage you might be able to get on different teams based on the interviews and based on the AI analysis.

(01:10:57):
It's pretty cool. And that's an app that I coded over a weekend with Devin a year ago. And then Alex runs part of the consulting has helped upgrade it. Then what we do is we have a training curriculum. So we go in and train each team and we customize it based on the interviews that we do. Because one of the interesting things about AI is it's such a general purpose technology, and I think people who work inside companies, 10% of them are like, I'm super curious about this. 10% are like, I will never touch this. And 80% are like, if you tell me how to do it for my job, I'll do it.

(01:11:31):
And so we customize the training to be like, here are the exact prompts you're going to use and here's the exact situations you're going to use them. And that really, I think helps drive the adoption. We spend four weeks with each team, an hour a week, that kind of thing. It seems to be really cool. And then we'll often also after this, go and build automations and do some of the AI operations stuff we were talking about earlier. Companies really like it. I think we work with a lot of big hedge funds and PE firms and big companies, all that kind of stuff. To your-

Dan Shipper (01:12:00):
Companies, all that kind of stuff. To your second question, which is, "What separates the good companies from the bad, or the companies that end up adopting this?," I think the number one predictor is, "Does the CEO use ChatGPT?," or insert your own chatbot. If the CEO is in it all the time, being like, "This is the coolest thing," everybody else is going to start doing it. If the CEO is like, "I don't know, this is for someone else," no one else is going to be able to lead that charge, and they're either going to have ... Either they're going to be negative on it, and so definitely no one's going to do it, or they're going to have way unrealistic expectations because they have no intuition for what's possible, and they're just going to get really disappointed.

(01:12:47):
But the CEOs that are using it all the time are able to both drive the excitement and set reasonable expectations for what can be achieved, and so those things end up working really well, and the people that do this really well ... So, for example, we work with a hedge fund called Walleye, which I had the founder on my podcast, AI and I, a few weeks ago, their gigantic $10 billion hedge fund. One of the things that they do, which I think they're basically the model for how to do this, first thing you did, which a lot of CEOs are doing is send the, "We're an AI-first company" email. Everyone's got the memo.

(01:13:20):
You just got to really do it, and one of the things he said in his memo, which I love, is, "I wrote this email with ChatGPT, and you should too." So you got to like ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
In the memo.

Dan Shipper (01:13:30):
Yeah. You got to lead from the front in that way. And then, what he does in, I think what a lot of other really cool companies do is they're doing weekly meetings where people share prompts and share use cases. They do a weekly email to their entire company, being like, "Okay, here are our usage stats for ChatGPT. Here are the people that came up with a new prompt and contributed to it."

(01:14:00):
Create this sort of awareness and momentum, because going back to the point I made earlier, about 10% of people are early adopters, those are the people inside of a company that you need to find and highlight because they're going to just go spend all this time figuring out what works, and then all you have to do is translate what they learn into the rest of the organization. And so if you create forums for them to be rewarded, you're going to automatically transfer a lot of their learnings to everybody else, and encourage more of it, and I think that's kind of the secret.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):
That is awesome. I love this advice. So just to reflect back, what you just shared, a few kind of tactics you find that you encourage within companies, one is just send this memo, the Toby memo. I don't know if that's the right way to describe it, who I think it was first along these lines just, "We're AI-first." It's going to be part of your performance review.

(01:14:50):
It's going to be asking, "Can you do it in AI before you could talk to anyone else?," all these things, and then just note, "I wrote this using ChatGPT's," it's a great idea. This idea of a weekly meeting, so it's like a live or Zoom meeting, where people share, "Here's the thing I've learned about using AI," and then this weekly stats email of, "Here's how much we're using ChatGPT across the org. Here's some people that did some awesome work."

Dan Shipper (01:15:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:13):
Amazing. And I especially love this very simple heuristic of, "If you're a CEO, uses ChatGPT or Claude, or whatever daily, it's going to work out."

Dan Shipper (01:15:22):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:23):
That is super cool. I know it's early, but what kind of impact have you seen from a company, kind of leaning into this and adopting AI widely? Anything you've seen either anecdotally or numbers-wise?

Dan Shipper (01:15:34):
It's early. It's really hard to say other than ... I think generally, people who do this well now feel like they can do way more work than they used to without having to hire more people, and so they're just going further faster at the same budget. I don't see a lot of people being like, "Cool. We're going to fire a bunch of people."

(01:15:58):
Also, I don't really want to do consulting work like that. That sucks. But we've never had to say no. Mostly, people are like, "Cool. I'm just going to go further with the people that I have."

(01:16:08):
I think also, back to kind of the first point I made about reshoring American jobs, I have seen some companies, not the ones that we worked with, but I have seen some companies of people that I'm friends with, where they're like, "We have a call center somewhere, but I think I can get the same amount done with two employees in the U.S. that use one of these customer service platforms." They're still not totally automatic. I think that Klarna CEO thing, that was bullshit. But, yeah, you can have a couple people in the U.S. that maybe you pay a little bit less to than you would for 100 people somewhere else, and obviously, that's the calculus that everyone has to make for themselves, but I've definitely seen that happen, and yeah, I think that's the get more done with the same amount of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):
Maybe to close out our conversation, I want to come back to this idea that you referenced, but I want to spend a little more time on this, which is this idea of the allocation economy. If I understand it correctly, we've been in this knowledge economy, where people get paid to do a thing, and your thesis is that we're moving to this allocation economy, where the manager skills become more important, and we're going to be spending more of our time managing. And I think what's amazing about this is it also tells you which skills will matter more in the future, which is something I think a lot of people are thinking about. So maybe just answer that question and share whatever you think is important to share to give people a sense of what you're thinking.

Dan Shipper (01:17:38):
Yeah. So this is based on our article I wrote two, two and a half years ago. So this is back before agents were even thought of as viable. And I was really trying to think about, "How do I express what ... In my experience, using this every day, what skills are useful for me?," because I think that'll be the case for a lot of other people, and I think that's kind of the best method, I think, to do these sorts of predictions, is you have to be doing it all the time yourself, and then that informs your opinion about this stuff.

(01:18:14):
So what I noticed using, at the time, like GPT-3 or maybe GPT-4, was that I was spending a lot of time, for example, thinking about, "How do I communicate the problem? How do I gather the right information for the problem? How do I put it in the right way so that the model that I'm working with gets it? How do I pick which model to give it to you, and how do I maybe divide up the task to be like, 'Okay, this model does this, this model does this,' based on what I know to be like, 'What's good and what's bad?'? How do I give them feedback?"

(01:18:50):
"How do I have a vision for what I want and a set of criteria for whether it's good?" All that stuff is exactly how I found myself using these tools, and I was like, "Oh, that's just managing." And once that clicks for you, I think you'll start to see a lot of other things. So a really good example is there's a big complaint that it's like, "Well, how can I have AI do this? I can't trust that they're going to do it well, so I just do it myself."

(01:19:22):
And I'm just like, "Yeah, that's exactly what Every first-time manager says." You always have this problem, where you're like, "Okay. Well, if I delegate it, it's not done in the way that I want it to be done. If I do it myself, I get no leverage." And so that's how a manager has to learn how to be a manager is like, "When do I lean in and maybe micromanage a little bit, and when can I delegate, and how can I trust it, and how do I divide up the task and all that kind of stuff?"

(01:19:45):
And so I think there's a lot of overlap in those skills. And those skills are not broadly distributed right now, but they will be in the future because it will be so much cheaper to be a manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):
And specifically, I was looking at the article you wrote, the skills that you highlight will be more valuable is evaluating talent, vision, taste, and to your point, when to get into the details, when it makes sense to dive in.

Dan Shipper (01:20:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:12):
Awesome. And then, there's also kind of a connected point you made that you referenced, which is that generalists will become more and more valuable in the future. You mentioned that everyone at Every is a generalist.

Dan Shipper (01:20:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):
Share a little bit about that.

Dan Shipper (01:20:22):
Yeah. I find ... I mean, maybe it's because I'm a generalist, so you should take this with a grain of salt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):
Same, same.

Dan Shipper (01:20:28):
But I think that's one of the things that has made AI so awesome for me, is I love to dabble in different things. So it's like in one day, I can be coding an app, and making a video, and making images, and writing, and all that kind of stuff, and ChatGPT is right there with me. And I think basically what has happened, as civilization has progressed from Ancient Greece to now, is what we've discovered is the more that we specialize, the better we can coordinate across many different people. And so it's like the Adam Smith, like there's a pin factory and someone's making a pin or whatever his thing is, is specialization against our trade. And there have been a lot of really good impacts of that.

(01:21:18):
One of my favorite examples of this is back to Ancient Greece, Ancient Athens. Athens was a civilization of generalists, at least for citizens. They have a bad history with women and people who are slaves, but let's just put that to the side for a second. If you're a citizen, generalist. You could be expected to be a fighter, a judge, a juror, maybe a general.

(01:21:46):
You could expect it to have many different roles inside of your society in your lifetime. That changed though, because Athens became an empire. And as it became an empire, if you're going to send a general off to go and invade Sicily or whatever, you want that person to be pretty skilled. And so it started to break the general kind of thing into people start to have specific roles, and they coordinate with each other and all that kind of stuff, and I think that pattern has actually been really good for developing civilization, but it's also, in a lot of ways, it is not as fun. It's actually really cool to be a well-rounded person. And I think the interesting thing about AI is that it's a little bit like, you can think of it like having 10,000 PhDs in your pocket.

(01:22:36):
It knows so much about every little branch of human knowledge and every art form and every way of making things or building things, and you just have access to that, so it's doing a lot of the ... It's good for doing a lot of the specialized tasks that you might've had to spend 10 years getting good at learning about this particular species of cicada, so you know exactly how they reproduce. But now, you've got this thing in your pocket that can tell you all about that in any given context at any given time, and so you're empowered to jump a lot more between all those different domains of skill, and you can get more done as, for example, like a founder, where I think we can stay at 15 people much longer than we would be able to. So the people inside of Every can stay generalists for much longer, and I think that that may sort of ripple out into the rest of the economy, where instead of gigantic, massive corporations, where each person is doing one little button turning, you have many more smaller organizations with more generalists, and I think that would actually be a really good thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:44):
This reminds me, I was talking to my personal trainer that I'm trying out for a little bit, and she said that she's a very big vision, kind of high-level person, and not good at executing, like we're staying organized, and ChatGPT is such a godsend for her, because she's just like, "Here's what I want to do roughly. Just help me get it done."

Dan Shipper (01:24:01):
That's great. I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:03):
And so, yeah. And it really made me think about just how much value all this stuff is going to unlock. This was amazing. It was everything I wanted it to be. But with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Dan, are you ready?

Dan Shipper (01:24:14):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:15):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Dan Shipper (01:24:21):
Well, I already recommended one, which is War and Peace. Definitely got to read that. If you want a like Tolstoy primer, I would read The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Another good one is A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, which is by George Saunders, and that's a collection of Russian short stories that is also about writing. And in particular, I really like the Russians because a lot of the Russian novelists are dealing with the effects of technology on the traditional Russian way of life, and they're very kind of in this really interesting middle ground between a sort of romantic outlook on the world and a more rationalist like, " We're progressing, we're making progress."

(01:25:02):
And that's one of the things you'll find in Anna Karenina, oh, and ... God, what's the guy's ... Levin is out in the fields with the peasants, doing the scythe thing. That's Tolstoy kind of thinking about, "Oh, what would it be like, instead of being a nobleman who's trying to make farms way more efficient, I was just like with my scythe, that was really happy?" Anyway, so they're dealing with a lot of similar stuff to, I think AI.

(01:25:27):
The Master and His Emissary is another really good one, and that's about basically how the different hemispheres of the brain view reality. It's really, really good, and I think it relates to a lot of AI stuff too. Yeah, I think those are my three or four. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:44):
Excellent list. I think nobody's mentioned any of these, so that's always a good sign. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Dan Shipper (01:25:53):
Yes. I really love Deadwood. Have you seen it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):
I absolutely love it. I remember when they stopped it for some reason. I think he had to go do something else at HBO. It was so sad.

Dan Shipper (01:25:59):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:06):
It's amazing, yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:26:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:26:07):
David Milch is incredible, national treasure, incredible writer. But what I really love about it, and I only recently watched it, is he talks about Deadwood being about how order forms out of chaos. So it's this like frontier town, people are going to it, and there's no law, there's no rules. And by season three, there's a mayor, and all the industry has come in, and it's like a real proper town, and I just love that. And I think there's a lot of parallels from the Western frontier to technology frontiers, and so I think that show is a really interesting study in that kind of dynamic.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:50):
I love how everything connects to how tech works and how AI came to be. I love this.

Dan Shipper (01:26:57):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:58):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Dan Shipper (01:27:00):
I don't have a good answer for that because I just spent a lot of time using our internal products, but my stock answer is Granola. So I do really love Granola. My one gripe with them, and I hope they listen to this podcast, is I really want to export all my notes. I want an API, but other than that, I think it's a fantastic product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:18):
That is definitely the most mentioned product in this segment for the past couple months, so good job, Granola. I can't help but mention, you get a year free of Granola if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter. Well, what a freaking deal. And not just you, but your whole company gets free Granola for a year. What a deal.

Dan Shipper (01:27:34):
This is not a paid promotion by me. That's just how I feel. So I'm glad it's part of the bundle.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:41):
Yeah, incredible. Okay. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?

Dan Shipper (01:27:47):
So basically, I use ChatGPT all the time, and it has memory. So I was like, "I'm going on Lenny's podcast. What would my life motto be?," and it said, "Your life motto is witness deeply, build bravely. You prize slow, attentive seeing, whether it's reading Tolstoy, tracking meditation themes, or X-raying a David Milch paragraph." So it's hitting all the stuff I just mentioned, which is really funny.

(01:28:10):
And then, Build bravely, you turn those insights into concrete things, like Every in Quora and longform essays and all that kind of stuff. So I think there's something about that. Actually, this reminds me, this actually reminds me of the actual motto, which is ... And I didn't come up with this. I think it's like Pliny the Younger said, "Do things worth writing about, and write things worth reading." Seems like a pretty good summation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:31):
Do things worth writing about and read things worth reading.

Dan Shipper (01:28:34):
Write things worth reading.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:36):
Write things worth reading. That should be the motto of both of our newsletters.

Dan Shipper (01:28:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:41):
That is really good. Okay. And by the way, I love that you asked ChatGPT, "What's my life motto?"

Dan Shipper (01:28:48):
And wait, this is interesting. So it didn't give me the answer, but inspired the answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:51):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:28:52):
And I think that's actually exactly how I use it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:55):
[inaudible 01:28:55] Wow. It's an extension of our brains already.

Dan Shipper (01:28:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):
Last question. I was reading somewhere, where you wrote that you stopped writing at one point. You were just like, "I need to do other things, I need to build this company," and then you realize, "I need to get back to writing," because things started going sideways. And I feel like this is such an interesting corollary to a lot of the stuff you talked about, of just things that make you happy, stay close to enjoy. Just share what happened there, because I didn't know that.

Dan Shipper (01:29:23):
This is definitely not a lightning round thing, so I'll expound, but I'll try to do it as quickly as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:29):
Perfect.

Dan Shipper (01:29:30):
I think generally, when you're building a company, even if you do it the way that I do it or did it, which is you don't raise a lot of money and you try to stay in control, there's a big temptation to try to run the company in the way you think you should. And I have this weird thing where I'm like, "I really love writing, but I also really love business," and there were not a lot of models for me of people who had successful businesses that were also writers. It turns out there are, but I didn't know about that for a while. And so early on at Every, it was growing really well, because I was writing a lot, and Nathan was writing a lot. And when I stopped writing, the business didn't work as well because media businesses don't follow the same pattern as tech startups, because if you're a media business and you are a founder who then hires people to make the product, which is right, if you have product market fit before, you lose it, and maybe you hire people that are good writers, but that's hard. It's total opposite pattern for startups. So you build the first version of the product, and then you hire people to build the rest of it, and so that's what I did. And I also really struggled with, "Okay, what are the implications for that and for my career," and I think it was hard for me to admit, like I actually want to write because I just didn't have any examples of someone being the kind of writer that I wanted to be. And what's really interesting is three years into the business ... The business has been pretty flat.

(01:30:57):
I was pretty miserable because I was not doing the thing that I really wanted to do, and I asked ChatGPT, I was like, "Are there any examples of writers that have built businesses?" And it was like, "Yeah, Joel Spolsky, who built Trello and Stack Overflow. There's Jason Fried who I've known for a long time, and I've always looked up to, but I forgot about in this context. There is Sam Harris who's got a great podcast, and he's got a gigantic meditation app. There is Bill Simmons, who's incredible podcaster and also built The Ringer, sold to Spotify for a couple hundred million bucks.

(01:31:32):
There's a lot of these people, and there are patterns that they use to build companies that are pretty well-understood. They're just not typical Silicon Valley patterns. And so I was like, "Cool. I just want to be a writer. I think it'll be really fun."

(01:31:48):
And so I sort of flipped. I still have the builder, entrepreneur, founder part of my identity, but I sort of flipped it to be like writing is at the center, and I'm unapologetic about it, and that's actually good for the business. It's good for me and it's good for the business. And the more I've leaned into that, doing the thing that ... If you told anyone that you're starting a business, where it's like, "Well, we're going to be a newsletter, and we're going to incubate all these apps, and we're going to do consulting and whatever," they would be like, "You're nuts."

(01:32:14):
"Everyone wants to do that. Of course, Every founder wants to do that, but you have to focus. You can't write, whatever." But every time I've kind of just leaned into something that feels like the most, the ultimate luxury of my hidden secret desire, it's actually worked a lot better, and I think you end up ... What it really is, is there's a huge tax to doing something every day that you don't quite like that much, or you're not quite a fit for, and by sort of giving into those secret desires, you end up finding a shape for the work that you do and the business that you build that is good for you, and that's always going to be a somewhat unique shape from other businesses that have been built.

(01:32:54):
It's always going to rhyme with other things, but I think finding that unique shape, instead of just kind of cargo culting, like what you think a company should look like is definitely a much better way to be successful, and it's also a much better way to live.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:08):
I think this is going to hit hard with a lot of people who are listening, who are maybe founders or want to be founders, and this resonates with a lot of people that have been on this podcast sharing similar lessons. Dan, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks check out Every, find you online, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Dan Shipper (01:33:24):
So you can find us at every.to. I'm also on Twitter at @danshipper. You can go there to check out our products, our newsletter, if you want to stay on top of AI, all that kind of stuff. I also have a podcast. It's called AI and I.

(01:33:41):
You can find it on YouTube and on Spotify. And how can people be useful? Honestly, I think that the most useful thing for someone like me, based on what I want to do, is I want people to find interesting, cool ways to use AI that actually helps make their lives better. So just go do that, and tell me about it, and I think that'll be great, and so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:01):
What's the best way to tell you? Is it comments on your YouTube show? Is it emailing you, DM you?

Dan Shipper (01:34:05):
I would say tweet me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:08):
Yeah.

Dan Shipper (01:34:09):
If you subscribe to Every, you can also reply to those emails, and they eventually get forwarded to me. So tweet me. Reply to Every. And if you want to comment on YouTube, great. I'm not in the YouTube comments as much as I should be, though.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:22):
Don't do that. Maybe don't do that.

Dan Shipper (01:34:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:25):
Okay. Well, Dan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for sharing. Thanks for being here.

Dan Shipper (01:34:29):

## Transcript

Daniel Lereya (00:00:00):
... 8:00 PM basically for me is someone that is relentless until he gets this impact, until he validates that this impact is in place. In some cases, doing the biggest impact is not developing another feature, it's about making the current value more accessible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You've been at this for eight years, you said there's 250,000 customers at this point. What would you say is the most counterintuitive thing you've learned through this journey of building Monday?

Daniel Lereya (00:00:25):
We really have an approach of very radical transparency about everything. Before we went public, we actually shared every bit of information with our employees. Instead of demoralizing people, I think that this is something that gives them a sense of deep partnership. We really want everyone's brains in the challenge, and not just one centralized brain and a lot of working hands.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
You basically realized that your competitors were shipping a lot faster than you were, that made you shift the way you think about product and the way you operate.

Daniel Lereya (00:00:58):
Some of our competitors did something that we can only imagine. We said, "Okay. We need to treat it differently." We received a gift from our competitors. They showed us that it's possible. Use your competition, know it, and take it, and set ambitious goals, and believe in yourself, and you can do amazing things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:14):
Today, my guest is Daniel Lereya. Daniel's currently chief product and technology officer at Monday.com. He joined when they were just around 40 employees. And, a few years in, Daniel and the exec team realized that their competitors were able to move a lot faster than they were and ship a lot more often than they were, and that's spurred a transformation in how they build and operate their teams. Very few companies are able to transform like this, and even fewer recognize that something is wrong. In our conversation, Daniel shares a bunch of very specific insights and suggestions into how to go about making change or even recognizing that something is wrong. Daniel shares moments when it felt like everything was going to crumble. Why it's important to know that the skills that got you to where you're today aren't the skills that are going to take you to the next level. Why it's so important to orient all your teams around impact and so much more.

Daniel, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Daniel Lereya (00:04:32):
Thank you so much for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:34):
We're going to get into the story of Monday. We're going to talk about your journey over the last eight years, building and scaling this company, and all the things you've learned along the way. But I want to start with a very specific moment that you shared with me, where you basically realized that your competitors were shipping a lot faster than you were, able to get stuff out a lot more quickly and more often than you guys, and that made you shift the way you think about product and the way you operate. Can you talk about that moment, and that lesson, and what you took away from that?

Daniel Lereya (00:05:06):
Yeah. Well, you take me a while back. I think it was when we were relatively a small team. I think we were something around 30 people. And, including engineers, and product, and everyone, it's actually that back in the days we did so many things. And, actually, we had an amazing, amazing execution. We had a weekly update. We would share everything that we did with the company and it was always super long and super... We had so many different things. And, we really felt good about ourselves at that point, to be honest, about the execution.

(00:05:49):
And then, I remember, one day, coming to the office and just looking on one of our competitors, and at Monday we have one of the main things that we have in the product is our boards. It's the heart and soul of the product. And, you can think about it as a table, and it has different column types, data types that you can capture within the board and work with. And, back then, we had five of these. And, I was actually coding the sixth one, to be honest. And, each and every one of these took us four months to develop together with defining the product and everything. And, this morning, we actually saw that one of our main competitors back then has actually launched 30 new columns.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:39):
30?

Daniel Lereya (00:06:40):
Yeah. And, we said, "Okay..." At first, we didn't really know what to do. And, we thought about it and I remember that we said, "Okay, we're going to take even some time out of the office. So back then, Roy and Eran, which are the founders, and also together with me and Tal, which was one of the main tech leads in Monday for a long time, and few others, we went outside the office and we said, "Listen, we need to do things differently. Something doesn't make sense." And, I remember back then that for me this realization of, understanding that we're doing so much, but suddenly, some of our competitors did something that we can only imagine, and actually transform the product, because it's a different platform, if you think about it. It was really hard. Personally, first of all, admitting that although you worked like crazy, you didn't do something that really transformed the product.

(00:07:51):
Because, I remember back then, when we did a conversation, we said, "Okay. We're doing so much. What is the most meaningful thing that we did over the last three months?" And suddenly, the answer was, "There's so many things." But it wasn't something specific. And after acknowledging that, it's a very hard thing personally, especially when you walk so hard and you put your entire heart in what you do, we said, "Okay. Now, we need to treat it differently. We received a gift from our competitors, they showed us that it's possible. Now, we need to think how. And in order to do that, we need to think differently." Because we said, "Okay. If we're going to add 25 more, multiply it by four months, we're a small team, we are lost. Okay, we can't make it." So we said, "Okay, we need to take upon ourselves an ambitious goal, like 25 columns in one month." And this is the goal that we took upon ourselves.

(00:08:59):
And, I think that the fact that our competitors did it, it didn't give us the excuse of saying, "It's not possible." So in a way, it was the biggest favor that we can ask for. And, long story short, month and a half afterwards, we had 30 columns in Monday. And, we did it by thinking totally different. And by the way, afterwards, we did it over and over again. So if you think about Monday, it's basically a platform for work and you have different building blocks, columns is one of them, but we did the same deal exactly with dashboards and widgets, and then with automations, and so on. So I think this was so transformative, because, A, we understood that you need to constantly think, especially at these phases, how would you transform completely the product in the next three months?

(00:09:55):
And if you can't answer that and you say, "Listen, I'm doing so much." But you can't point this exact thing, you have a focus problem in my eyes. And second is that put ambitious goals, it'll make you think differently. And, we really love now to do it even when we don't know it's possible and it actually works for us time after time. And, let's think about it. The team that was there suddenly became invincible, because it's such an amazing, amazing experience that you have a goal that you don't know how you're going to do it and you succeed, and then it makes you feel that everything is possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):
There's so much here. And, I have so many threads I want to follow on. One is just, there's this metaphor of the four-minute mile, where no one thought it was possible, and then someone did it, and then everyone started beating that record. So I like that this is highlighting, there's just so much power in seeing somebody else accomplish something you thought was impossible, and that unlocks the way you think. And, I love that you saw it as a gift. A lot of companies do this, they're in this place and they're like, "No way." It's like when the iPhone launch like, "No one needs that. There's no keyboard." And a lot of people deny that it's a thing they should be paying attention to. I love that you saw it as like, "Okay, we need to move. Things have changed. We're not doing things. We're not going to be competitive long-term."

Daniel Lereya (00:11:23):
I think it's also very much about focus. And I think that it's very hard to get to very good execution, but it doesn't guarantee that you are working in the right way. And many times, in my eyes, simple questions can provide the most and the deepest insights about your work. And I think that, for us, the fact that we managed to leverage it, as you said, and see it as a gift is one of the most important things. Use your competition, know it, use it to your advantage, and take it, and set ambitious goals, and believe in yourself, and you can do amazing things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):
Another, I think, piece a lot of people are probably resonating with here is starting a company that's small, growing, things are going great, and then all of a sudden, things start to slow down. And, in some cases, you don't realize that they've slowed down. And, that's what happened in your case. Sounds like in a lot of cases, the founder's like, "What the hell's going on? Why is it taking three or four weeks to ship one of..." Whatever you call them. And so, is there anything... By the way, what was the scale of the company at this point?

Daniel Lereya (00:12:26):
It's a good question. If I'm not mistaken, it was around 2018 back then, it's safe to assume 150, 200 people in the company. But, we were relatively small.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:43):
I recently had Ryan Singer on the podcast who created the Shape Up method from Basecamp, and that's his piece of advice too is around 50 to 100 people things start to really change, and slow down, and that's where a lot of companies start to go sideways. So that resonates. That's really interesting. And by the way, these columns you're describing, just to make it clear, this is a new data, new format of column, it's a new data format that you're building. It's not like, just add another column to some database.

Daniel Lereya (00:13:10):
Yeah. So actually, exactly. It's a new column, but it's a whole product around it. If you think about it, for instance, you have a column that dates, so it's pretty straightforward, but you can also have formula column, which is more complicated and has more complex product around it. I think, one of the best benefits for us as platform is that suddenly when we set the goal of adding so many different columns, we actually stopped for the first time and say, "What is the column like?" And we also organized all the product architecture around it. And, these things sounds really trivial in retrospect, but we really define, "Okay, each column need to have specific capabilities. It should be able to export it to Excel. It should be able to be filtered and sorted." And so many different other things. But basically, we defined what is it, and then create an infrastructure for all these shared things, making the work of adding a new column just thinking about the specific product that you want to provide with each one of these columns.

(00:14:19):
And the story about it is actually even more interesting. The way we actually achieved it is that we said, "Okay. In two weeks, we're going to have a hackathon, in which, each one of our developers is going to take one column and implement it in one day." And, if you think about it, from four months to one day, it's mind-blowing. And, back then, I remember, people said, "How can it be?" But then, I told you about build an infrastructure, he sent it to me. I did a column at night, just to see how it works. And, on the day that we did the columns, everyone knew what they're going to do, what they're trying to solve, and we just did it. And, two weeks afterwards it was in production, which was amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):
What we want to do here is help people avoid these moments where they're almost too late and realizing that things have slowed down. So I think really another important lesson here is the power of ambition and thinking crazily big. A lot of people think that when you ask your team when need to build 25 columns in a month or whatever it was, people would be burned out or feeling super depressed. But really, people get excited. There's all this opportunity to think really differently. It reminds me at our Airbnb, Brian Chesky was very famous for you give him a goal, "Here's our goal for the year." And he's like, "What it would take to 10X this goal?" Just like, "What would it take to do that?" And he's always pushing you to think a lot bigger, because your first reaction's like, "No, no, no. Leave us alone?" But then, you realize, if you really think big, it changes everything about how you approach the problem as you described, where instead of... Like in a day. What would it take to build this in a day?

Daniel Lereya (00:16:05):
Yeah. And I think, by the way, this is something which is really important about setting ambitious goals. If you set a different goal, "I want to reduce it from four months to three months." So many times, this translates in people's heads to, "I want you to work harder. I want you to work longer hours." And, this is not a message here. It's about working smarter. And I think that many times when we talk about speed of execution, there's fake speed, which means, trying to do the same work by skipping stages or not doing the high quality that you want, but there's the real speed, and speed of organizations, and speed of execution. Many times, it's about doing things right. It's about understanding, A, what is going to move the needle? And work only on that. Not working in a lot of things that you tend to invent when you're trying to solve a problem.

(00:17:01):
And B, is about, as you said, thinking differently. And I think that for the goals, this is why we really wanted the goal that you really understand from the first minute that if you work the same way, you cannot achieve it, even if you sleep in the office. So you need to change dramatically how you think. And, the advanced phase of it is that today we're doing it on things that we didn't see others doing. And, we have the confidence, because we have the experience of trusting ourselves that this is an exercise for us that will make us actually think about different solutions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):
I know another element of this that is really important to you that you have shifted the way you all operate is focusing on impact. There was a lot of focus on just building a lot of stuff and you realize there's a lot of power in thinking from perspective of how do we have the most impact? Talk about that.

Daniel Lereya (00:18:00):
This is the core and the main thing that we also measure our teams, and this is how I see a great PM. So a great PM basically for me is someone that is relentless until he gets this impact, and until he validates that this impact is in place. And, for us, it really changed how we think about things. It really changed how we set goals for our teams. So in many ways PM in Monday, first and foremost, is responsible for creating the shared understanding on what would be impactful for our customers. Okay? It's not about the solution and what we are going to build. It's about, what's the problem, what's the opportunity. And second, how we will know that we moved the needle. And without these two things, you can build so many different things, and it's songs for the door. Such huge part of what I build was never used by users the way I fought it was going to use.

(00:19:02):
So I think that, for me, having this understanding of what we want to change for our customers and also how we know we did it is a huge, huge part of the PM. And, for us, it means that we pay a lot of time in setting goals, in making sure that we really understand both, again, the opportunity, but not only that, but how we'll see and we'll know for sure that we move the needle. In many ways, it changes the conversation. So PMs and the teams, many times, spending a lot of time at the problem area, before they think about the solution. The solution is not the case anymore. There are so many different solutions. And, once you do that and you have these goals, suddenly, it reduces also a lot of the discussions that you have about the different solutions, because everyone knows that everything is going to be tested in real life. So they make everyone treat it differently.

(00:20:05):
And also, in that way, it makes you think much more holistically, which I also think is something that is very special at Monday, is that, we give our teams real life goals as much as we can. And then, in some cases, doing the biggest impact is not developing another feature. It's about making the current value more accessible. It's about connecting better the go-to market motion that you have. It's about understanding how your customers are going to learn what you built and use it. And, this realization is something that we try very hard to stay on it. And, it's hard, because people tend to build things. We all love to build things. And, when you start to build things, you get excited, and suddenly, you lose track of why you are doing it, and why do you need to change.

(00:21:04):
And, I think that in that sense, this is the most important part about this point of impact. And, this is also how we measure ourselves, so we can work extremely hard. It doesn't mean that we're successful, it doesn't mean that we're doing our work right. And, it's not only for the PMs, it's for the entire team. So the entire team succeeds or fail together, based on the value that we bring to our customers. And we have a lot of different ways in order to make sure that we stay honest to this principle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:37):
There's a lot of people listening to this that work at, say, modern tech companies, very high growth tech companies that are just like, "Duh, this is how you should work." A lot of people hearing this are like, "I don't really understand. What am I doing wrong? What am I missing?" Maybe. What's a sign that you're not oriented around impact?

Daniel Lereya (00:21:56):
I think, the most obvious sign for me is that you are building something without the aim or without the initial aim of what it changed for your users and how you are going to measure it. So in my eyes, it's many times the fact that you don't have a goal or the goal is like... Many times, for me, a smell for that is that I hear people use the word, "We're going to enhance..." "We're going to augment..." "We're going to extend value, and this, and this, and this." No, it's not enough. What is it going to change for users and how you are going to see it that it actually happened? And then, you start asking yourself all the questions, right? Because, once you have a goal that you're committed to, suddenly, you think about the target audience, because you need big enough target audience, for instance, in order to get to your goals. You need to make sure that what you build actually going to touch all of these people.

(00:22:58):
And I can share just a recent example. And, these things sound trivial and maybe an example would help resonate with that, because I know many people are thinking like that. And, we have a very interesting offering that we just introduced with AI, it's called AI Blocks. Okay? And basically, it means that with no-code, you can integrate blocks which contain AI actions within your existing workflows. And, 70% of Monday's customers are non-tech. And for them, this makes AI accessible for them and has a huge, huge value. And we started building these blocks and we listed to customers and we measured discoverability, and adoption, and retention, and so on. And, something that we do in order to stay connected to the numbers. So each team at Monday has, what we call, the daily numbers update. So think about it like a message that the team is building with all the numbers-

Daniel Lereya (00:24:00):
... a message that the team is building with all the numbers that they care about, because we really want people to live these numbers. So, for AI, for instance, for the AI blocks, it was the AI actions. So we had the AI actions, how many accounts are we using these AI actions, and so on, and so on. And we got amazing responses from our customers. We see great success of them getting value from the AI actions. We use a Slack channel in which one of our internal systems, [inaudible 00:24:36], is sending us this messages every day, and then we have conversations about it, okay? And one day, we saw, we noticed that the amount of accounts that are using AI is super, super low comparing to the entire population that we have. And we have 250,000 paying companies that use Monday, and we saw only few thousands there. And until this point, everyone in a very good feeling that we are making an amazing product, we get really good feedback, we are building great value, we're adding value, but we sat down and say, "Okay, why it's only this and this?" Then someone say, "Yeah, since AI is new, we need to do change of the terms of service for customers before we are opening it to them," and this is planned in the next quarter, or something like that. And said, "What? No, we need to do it now. We need to now open it for everyone because this is actually what would be the most impactful thing to do."

(00:25:48):
And then the team went and sat with legal, and sent with everyone. And with two weeks time, it was open to 98% of Monday customers. And I think, in that sense, this is a very good example because we could have continued building value, and it's great, but the impact wouldn't be the impact that we were aiming for, and this is a very important point. I think, in that sense, staying really connected to your teams... to your numbers. Sorry, this is something that I really feel strongly about. I feel that you need to get your numbers and push. You need to live by them. For me, it's so exciting to see a conversation that says, "Oh, wow, today, there were a lot of new accounts that are using what I'm building. Let's see why it happens." And this kind of things that I see the conversation about, it's amazing.

(00:26:46):
And also, in this case, seeing the AI actions go, it's like you want to dive it and push it forward. And in many ways, they feel that this is a very good example on where you can actually build a lot of value. You can walk really fast, you can deliver a lot of features, but the problem lays in other place in order to get the impact that you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:08):
Yeah. There's so much joy in watching your number go up. So, just to close the loop here, to help people see if they're impact-driven, working from a perspective of how do we drive the most impact, one simple way of thinking about it is you're working backwards from a goal that is going to drive business growth and revenue, basically, in the end. If you're working backwards from a number, and a metric, and a goal, and then thinking through what are the levers that will most move this metric, that's a sign you're thinking by impact, versus, "Let's just keep shipping features that the sales team wants."

Daniel Lereya (00:27:43):
Yeah. And I think another thing for me, it's an exercise that I really encourage everyone to do. For me, it was after the columns hackathon and everything that we talked about, I said, "Okay, each quarter..." and this is when we were much smaller, but it can be each month, it can be each two weeks, but how do I imagine the company and the product is going to be different and better for our customers in a quarter from now? And from that, walk it backwards.

(00:28:17):
But if you are just saying, "We'll have better security. We'll have better performance. We'll have less bugs. We'll have more enhancements to," I don't know, "this and this feature," it's not enough. You need to constantly build value, which is pivotal to your customers. And if you don't do it and if it's hard for you to answer about this question, it's a very good sign that you are not impact-driven. And I love to do it also with teams and individuals like, "What are the things that you are most proud of that you did in the last three months?" And if it takes you a lot of time to think, you are not very focused and you are definitely not maximizing the impact that you want due to that, in my eyes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:01):
I like that exercise as a, versus waiting for your competitors to do something and then realizing we're way behind, it's forcing yourself every quarter to think about this. So do you do this as you have a meeting or something on your calendar, or how do you actually operationalize this?

Daniel Lereya (00:29:17):
Today, we are under the builders organization, which is the engineering, product management, product design. We are 700 people. So, we have a lot of different ways and methodologies to do it in different levels, but I'll give you an example from the company level and from the team level maybe, because these are the most interesting ones. So, we just recently had our yearly kickoff. Each and every year, we do a yearly kickoff for our company, and one of the most exciting sessions, obviously, is what we are going to do with our product as a product company. And I really like to have a slide in which I write and I just share it, " When I'm going to stand here in a year from now, what is going to be different for our customers?" And this is on the company level.

(00:30:08):
And I have one slide, and it talks about our offering and it talks about the value that they are getting in a way that, next year, I want to... each year to start my presentation with the slide from last year and see where we are. And in this level, it can be something like, "Our CRM continues with a very strong momentum and becomes a product suite when we give much more robust value to our customers." This can be an example with an additional product of CRM marketing, I would just say.

(00:30:42):
But on a team level, what we did, and maybe I'll take an example from the early days, we really love to do, each and every two weeks, I told you we would write an update for the entire company about what we did, and the way we did it is that each and every one of our team members actually write out his highlights and then we would share it with the company. And this exercise really made us sit every two weeks and think on individual level, but also on a team level. And every one of our team members used to read these updates and say, "Dan, we had a good two weeks," or, "We had a bad two weeks," "We did a lot of impact," or, "We did not enough impact." So I really encourage to create these points in time where you sit down and you force yourself to understand whether what you did is what you thought you are going to achieve or not.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:46):
That's great. I really like the slide idea. It's basically there's all this power and just working backwards from something in the future, however you come up with it. So, it's just like, in a year, we're going to have... There's just working backwards from a goal, working backwards from a big vision. I think those are such good exercises. Obviously, Amazon's famous Working Backwards. There's a whole book called Working Backwards from their PR approach. Okay, I want to go in a slightly different direction. I want to zoom out a little bit. So you've been at this for eight years, building Monday. You said there is 250,000 customers at this point. What's the revenue scale? Give people a couple stats to give them a sense of just how large this company has gotten.

Daniel Lereya (00:32:24):
We recently announced that we cost the 1 billion in ARR, and we are serving, as I said, 250,000 customers across the globe from virtually any industry that you can think about, more than 200 different business verticals. It could be both tech and non-tech-savvy customers. The vast majority of our customers are non-tech, from a customer that is building airplanes and cruise ships, all the way to real estate, construction, finance, tech, and everything you can basically think of. Just for reference, in a single [inaudible 00:33:06], when I joined Monday eight and a half years ago, back then, we were called the Pulse. We had around 4 million in ARR, and we scaled from there to 1 billion. And from around 30, 40 people in the company to 2,500 right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:29):
Awesome. When you talk about the product you're building, to a lot of people, it's like, "Oh, it's like project management software, all this column. What's the big deal?" But I had Drew Houston on the podcast, and he made this really interesting point when he talks to people working at SpaceX, who are launching rockets to Mars, and he talked about people building ships. If you really boil down what are they doing day-to-day, they're sitting in tools like Monday, putting together tasks, and doing to-dos, and sharing documents. This is what the world runs on. So it's important to have that perspective. With that, putting that aside for a second, I think very few people have seen what you've seen, seeing a company scale this way. Also, the transformation you just shared of just almost shipping too much and being slow to like, "Okay, let's rework things to shipping 25 columns in a month," and all these things. Very few people have seen this, so there's a lot to learn from this journey that you've been on. So I have a bunch of questions in a bunch of different ways of approaching some of your biggest lessons from this journey. The first is, let me just ask you this question, what would you say is the most counterintuitive thing you've learned about building product and leading teams through this journey of building Monday?

Daniel Lereya (00:34:39):
Maybe, first of all, it's about something that we really care about, which is transparency. Let me tell you a story. I sat down for dinner at my family, and many different members of my family are entrepreneurs, so working as an executive in tech companies and so on. And back in the days, we as Monday, before we went public, we actually shared every bit of information with our employees. You would get into our office and you would see a dashboard with how many paying accounts do you have, how many people have churned today, how many signups do we have, and so many different things. Even if you came for an interview, you would see these numbers.

(00:35:27):
And I remember sitting in this dinner and everyone would tell me, "Listen, you are making a mistake. How can you do it when things go south? You'll demoralize the team and people will get upset about it." And I think this is, for me, one of the most important things. When you hire and you have such a talented team, we want to share with them everything, and the reason for that is that, "Dan, you are working on every challenge together." And instead of demoralizing people, I think that, for the right people and the people that are working at Monday, this is something that gives them a sense of deep partnership. And as a leader, there were many situations in my professional life that I knew some bit of information and I felt all the way on my shoulders, and I love to call it the dark side of the moon. You're there alone, right? You are coming to the office. There's nothing more demoralizing or depressing as a leader that you feel awful because something that you know and you're coming to the office and everything is great and everyone are happy.

(00:36:47):
And I think, in Monday, we really wanted to do it differently and we really have an approach of very radical transparency about everything, and this actually makes everyone part of what we are doing. And in a way, we like to say, "We really want everyone's brains in the challenge and not just one centralized brain and a lot of working hands." And I can share examples when, for instance, suddenly, people would come up to the office. We have dashboards, of course, everywhere in the office. Each team has its own dashboards. We have our company dashboards for metrics and so on. And I remember cases in which someone said, "Listen, what happened to the conversion?" And think how powerful it is when you have everyone at the company looking at these things. And many of the things that we discovered, many of the things that we saw as challenges and problems is things that people saw due to this transparency.

(00:37:48):
So I think that maybe the counterintuitive part is that don't be afraid to share the information. It's exactly the other way around. And I can probably share that, even today as a public company, we really share everything that we can. And also, if you are a product manager at Monday, you are signing a 10b5 program for selling your stocks, meaning that we found a way to make everyone still see the data because we think this is the most important part. And I think this is one thing that I really believe in and really changed how we work, and also how people are feeling about being partners in building Monday and not just working at the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:37):
Is that thing they sign that's just like auto sell stocks? So they're not-

Daniel Lereya (00:38:37):
Exactly, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:41):
... selling based on information, based on announcements that's coming. Okay, got it. So every PM basically has to automatically, "Can't decide, I'm going to sell my stock tomorrow because this number is tanking."

Daniel Lereya (00:38:51):
Yeah. So we want to give people a choice. But usually, we really feel that, in most cases, you really need to know this information in order to do your work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:02):
That's so interesting. And I think people even prefer just dollar cost average sell. It's like makes life easier, not having to try to time all these things.

Daniel Lereya (00:39:11):
I definitely think so, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:14):
That's really interesting. And that's just product managers, or how far does that all go?

Daniel Lereya (00:39:19):
No. So, basically, when we became public, I remember still one of the conversations that we had with the bankers and the lawyers about, "Listen, guys, things would need to change. You cannot have a dashboard. We follow your financials at the entrance of the building. It doesn't make sense as a public company." And we understood it, but we didn't want to let go of what we cared about because we really believe this is one of the main drivers to the business, having this transparency and having this shared brains mode. So, we tried to think about ways in order to do it.

(00:39:59):
So, now, if I'll fast-forward, we're almost four years public, and we have an internal app called Monday Morning. And in Monday Morning, you have two parts, part A and part B. Part A is for every company employee, contains a lot about engagement and a lot of data that can be shared with everyone, and part B is confidential and it's by role, okay? So it's the company management, but I think the important point is that we see product management as something that got to have these numbers. So we thought about it really hard, and it's a lot of logistics to do so many plans, 10b5 plans, but I think it's worth it, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:45):
This is so interesting. A lot of companies talk about transparency, and you guys are... I think radical transparency is a good way to describe this because I've never heard of a company doing this where you have to sign this-

Daniel Lereya (00:40:57):
They didn't hear about it as well, apparently. And yeah, it took time to get to these solutions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:05):
That's so funny. So, for people that are listening to this, they're like, "Hey, maybe we should explore this." What's one thing you'd suggest that they could do to start moving down this road? And the benefit, again, is you... I guess maybe, again, remind people of the benefits of doing this, because it sounds like a lot of work and risk.

Daniel Lereya (00:41:20):
So I think that, as a young startup, it's actually not such a hard work. When we were very small back in the days, we had the daily numbers concept that we now have for the teams, we had the daily numbers for the company, how much paying accounts, how many upgraded, downgrade, and so on daily, and you saw people reacting to it on a daily basis. So this is something that you can do in virtually one hour, and it changes how people see their role within the company, focus everyone to the company's KPIs because everyone understand what you care about, and so on. So this is one thing that you can do extremely fast, and I don't see any disadvantage, aside from the fact that people are afraid. Many time, you are afraid. And I can share, it's so much... It's even a bigger lift that you don't need to think, "Can I share it? Can I don't share it?" You just let it go and everything would be okay. And I can share from my experience that we shared everything.

(00:42:23):
And the second thing which is really practical, it's the office dashboards. We really believe in it. So, you buy a TV, you put it on the wall, you start a conversation due to it, "What do we want to show on this TV?" And when we were a smaller startup and we sat all in one office space, we had our company goals dashboard, and it also had... We programmed it to have sounds on meaningful events. So, when you had, for instance, new paying account, you had the almost Simpson saying the same with the, "$1 million, I'll become a millionaire," or something like that. For new signup, you add the tick, and so on. So, suddenly, everyone are living it. It becomes part of the cadence of the company. So these are just two ideas to make it super easy, and the change happens immediately.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):
I love how that connects back to the whole point about impact. People all lining around here is what we're trying to drive. If the Simpson sound is going off, that's a sign that this matters, and it's something we should be driving up.

Daniel Lereya (00:43:29):
And it creates such a partnership. I remember reaching to the first time where we had $1 million collection in one month, breaking the record of new paying accounts for one day, everyone are living. But in many companies, only the management or the founders are feeling. And I think that, in that sense, you already feel that you have a great power because everyone around is the same things, and it makes conversations different because everyone understands what matters to you at that point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:57):
This is awesome, really cool counterintuitive lesson. I feel like a whole podcast could be done on how to do this effectively. I want to move on, but I guess if people want to start implementing this at the company, let's just say they should go talk to you, and you could give them a bunch of advice.

Daniel Lereya (00:44:10):
I would love to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder of Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:20):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show. But for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:44:30):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018 focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications, like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names, like Atlassian RAMP and LangChain, start and scale their security programs, and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:01):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources, and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:45:08):
That is very much our experience before the company, and to some extent, during it, but the idea is, with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:25):
We appreciate you for doing that, and you have a special discount for listeners. They can get $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:45:39):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):
Any other big counterintuitive lessons from the journey that you think would be fun to share?

Daniel Lereya (00:45:45):
One thing I really love about what we do in Monday is that we really love to take risks, not for the sake of it, but we are not afraid to do bold moves. And many times, when you want to do bold moves, you have a lot of concerns, especially when you start to be successful, because you are afraid that you are going to break everything that you built until now. And for me, one of the most pivotal moments in the company life is when we decided that, back in the days, as you said, we were a platform, but we had a go-to market of project management tool and we said, "Listen, people are doing so many different things on top of Monday. They are building a CRM of Monday and they are building a software for managing their dev cycles, and they are building so many different things," and we took a strategic decision to become a multi-product company which is built on top of this platform. And we actually did something which is really counterintuitive.

(00:46:46):
The first thought that comes to mind, at least for me, is, "Why maybe not just launch a new product, do it relatively on the side, gradually understand if it's successful? And if it would be successful, double click on it." But we actually did it in a very different way. We actually announced five different new products simultaneously on the same time, and we had so many... I can't stress enough how hard it is to think about it. Because I remember when we talked about and doing it, people say, "What? But we are going to confuse our current users and it's going to have conversion. And how are we going to do the marketing now when we have so many different go-to markets? And the sales, they don't know how to navigate people to different... And what about pricing?" So many different concerns, but we decided to do it because we really want to create a pivotal leap.

(00:47:46):
And I think that, in that sense, fast-forward to this day, part of these products were really successful. For instance, Monday sale CRM is going faster than Monday back in the days, when it's amazing to see it, and-

Daniel Lereya (00:48:00):
In the days when it's amazing to see it. And some of them we understood that they don't need to be separate products and we collapse them back to the main product. But the point is, is that we managed to learn and to change both internally at the company, how the perception of everyone around what we are building, but also externally.

(00:48:21):
This move changed dramatically the competitive landscape that we live in. And, I think there was a lot of friction. Many people at the company were having a lot of friction with it. It was really, really hard.

(00:48:35):
But looking back it's such, I'm so happy with this move and the fact that we did it like that because just imagine what would happen if we would choose one of them and it wasn't the successful products. And our conclusion can be that multi product won't work for us.

(00:48:52):
We really managed to transform the company in a very short amount of time and also to create new reality. And I think that people need to remember that and I'm constantly reminding it to myself. And I think this is something that we are constantly working with each other in order to make sure that we remember that not taking bold risks, not making bold moves, it's a risk for itself. Okay?

(00:49:21):
And many times people want the inertia, people want just the incremental value. But if you want to do leaps many times you need to let go of things that were successful for you in the past. And this is very counterintuitive and we did a lot of mental models to help us cope with it.

(00:49:38):
So I remember that when we were small and we had for instance 20,000 paying customers, so we said, "Listen, but most of Monday's customers are not customers of Monday, yet. So we need to think about them, as well."

(00:49:51):
And this is something that really helps you because many times you need to do things that affect the current success that you have. But I think this is another very, very important thing that I am constantly reminding to myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:07):
There's kind of this other recurring theme that I'm noticing of just thinking big and taking leaps. And I love this point you made of not doing that is actually a big risk. Not taking a risk is a big risk. That's a really powerful point.

(00:50:20):
And it's innately scary to do something risky. And so, I love the push here of just take more risks because it's so easy. And this comes back again to the beginning of the conversation where we're just building things the way they've always been built. And looking back and what have we even done? What have we done over this year of hard work and tons of features?

(00:50:39):
I think a lot of companies get in that place where they're just like, "What are we?" Like in our B and B, I had this exact, Brian is constant like, "What are we even shipping all these billions of experiments that are moving the numbers? What are we even doing? I don't know anything that we ship that's really exciting."

(00:50:52):
And so, I think this is a really good reminder and push to just think bigger and you need to take big leaps. So, love that. Is there any other big counterintuitive lessons before we move in a different direction?

Daniel Lereya (00:51:06):
I really believe that many time, like spending more time on working on something will not yield to better results or to better products. And I think that many times we, as people, that are building products for others get to a point where the feedback that we want to get in the bottom of our heart is like, " Wow, what an amazing product you have built."

(00:51:33):
And I think this is a very bad feedback to get for initial things that you are doing. Because it means that, I feel that in many ways, the point in which you make real people use your product is really scary. Because you suddenly put your work out there and then in order to actually, and you are afraid that they will say, "Listen, it's a lousy product, it's not a good product." But actually we really encourage people to get really fast production, to put traps for themselves that is called by time and not by effort.

(00:52:12):
And, many times I saw that more time creates more questions. It creates more complications. It creates more assumptions that we put for ourselves in thinking what our users need. And we invent things.

(00:52:29):
And we do it all from good reasons. We want people to like what we build, we want them to get value. But, for me, this is a very important point that many times using, like the setting traps mechanism of saying, "Listen, we have three weeks, let's think about it."

(00:52:50):
And [inaudible 00:52:51] by time, it makes you extremely focused. And this is very important because we really want to get feedback from customers that say, "Yeah, listen, this is on the direction. I'm still missing this and this and this. And also we really love the fact of this is not a good product."

(00:53:11):
And I can give you a recent example. Even when now we work with big customers and, of course, there are different ways to implement what I said than you are a small startup. But we are building a new offering of enterprise work management. Think about it like a way of managing projects. It's a huge, huge scale. Thousands of projects like tens of thousands of employees and so on.

(00:53:33):
So, I really love using the deadline trap and it makes you focused, it makes you sharper in thinking. And, we just had a recent example with the offering I was telling you about of enterprise work management, managing project at scale. And this is an enterprise product.

(00:53:48):
So you have all the reasons in the world to say, "No, I can't release it, yet. I need more time. I need to do more things. They won't use it. They need this and this and this."

(00:53:58):
And I think that we actually released the first alpha version to them. And we got a feedback of, "Listen guys, this is premature. We need more comprehensive value." But we got exactly the feedback of what, and this is priceless.

(00:54:13):
And my response to the teams is, "Well done. I think you did an amazing job in releasing it and making sure." Because many times, being so afraid of releasing it and thinking, "If I just have 1, 2, 3 more weeks, I will build a better product." I think it's not true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:34):
This is such good advice. It resonates so much with recent other conversations I've had. So, just to clarify what you're saying, basically, you have a time box.

(00:54:42):
When you say traps, it's basically a set amount of time. We're going to spend three weeks on this feature and if we don't hit the three weeks, we just cut scope, essentially. Is that the idea?

Daniel Lereya (00:54:51):
I think, yeah, it's like this is the basic version of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:52):
Yeah.

Daniel Lereya (00:54:55):
But now, for us, we really want and we really love doing it as an exercise for ourself. For instance, let's say, now as a public company we say, "Listen, we're working on something. We want to announce it on the next earning. And put a trap for ourselves."

(00:55:09):
Why? Because, again, it makes you sharp. It makes you super focused about things. And I think that in many ways this results in a much better product because you are not building things that you invented. You are staying really true to what your users needs, the real core of the value.

(00:55:32):
And, it's really funny to see the dynamics of teams when they are planning from the bottom up. So, it starts with something that like let's say you've done everything great. Okay, you have the opportunity, you understand, you have the KPIs, everything is in place, but now you're starting to plan it.

(00:55:50):
And, suddenly, people are raising concerns and issues. And it becomes a sport to say what can go wrong and like being fear- driven. And then you tend to protect yourself and adding more content and more content. And then when you see what happens, it's actually, it's going to be shipped in two years.

(00:56:11):
And then we say, "Okay, no. Okay, we have earnings in two months. What can we ship to this earnings? And let's put a tab." And then you suddenly see the conversation changes. First of all, it makes everyone really focused on what's the core of the value. And it removes all the theoretical discussions that people have and things like that.

(00:56:31):
And, the results are amazing. And you need to remember when you do it, you need to continue afterwards like according to feedbacks and not let it go just but what you did in the first version. But, in many ways, I really love the fact that the first version get the feedback, which is not everything is perfect because if this is the feedback, it means that we built too much and probably it's not focused product enough.

(00:56:58):
And when you build a lot of features, this can be like a death by a thousand cuts because in each corner of the product you add more than you need.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):
Yeah, there's so much here that connects the other conversation we just had. We had Gaurav Misra, he's the CEO of Captions and he made this point that if people aren't complaining about your product, you want to see people complaining because that means they care. There's something there that they care about. If you're not hearing any complaints, they could care less about what you're building and that's a bad sign.

Daniel Lereya (00:57:27):
I really loved it. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
Their company actually goes to the extreme of what you're describing. Every engineer ships a marketable feature every week. That's their pace.

Daniel Lereya (00:57:38):
I really connected to it. And by the way, about user feedback, I think it's really nice because many times people associate, like they only measure themselves by user feedback and a specific point. And I think this is also maybe something that is counterintuitive. Not every customer feedback is the feedback that will drive you to the end result of the best product out there.

(00:58:06):
There are many aspects to it. I can share just one example about us. We, as a, in the beginning of the company, we, for instance, didn't want to have a free trial. And part of it is that we really wanted to hear feedback about our product only from people that the product means something to them. The best proxy for that is that they are paying because it means they get real value. And you know, in that sense it helped us at the beginning to stay super focused about separating the wheat from the shaft with the customer's feedback. So I think it's a super important point and we need to take customer feedback in context.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:51):
The other really interesting point here that you're making is this idea of, we had, I think I mentioned this already, Ryan Singer, he's the creator of this method, Shape Up, which is very centered around appetites over deadlines.

(00:59:02):
There's so many, everyone listening to this has probably gone through an exercise where like, "Let's redo our landing page." And it's like, "Yeah, it'll probably have some impact. Let's spend some time on this."

(00:59:11):
It ends up taking six months. And everyone's like, "Why did we spend six months redoing this freaking landing page? I would've given it three weeks and then moved on."

(00:59:21):
And the way to do that is you just commit upfront, "We will spend three weeks on this. We'll get as much done as we can in three weeks and then we'll move on."

(00:59:29):
People talk about this very hard to actually do so I love that's how you actually approach some of these bigger features you work on. Do you guys practice Shape Up by any chance or this is just a thing you do?

Daniel Lereya (00:59:38):
No, actually, I wasn't that familiar with it, but I definitely going to check it out. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:42):
Okay, cool. Yeah, it's a whole method. And I think the episode right before this is actually that episode. Okay. Let me go in a different direction and kind of keep extracting lessons from this journey because that was a really fruitful place to go.

(00:59:54):
So let me ask you this question. What's one thing that you wish you'd known before stepping into the role that you're in today?

Daniel Lereya (01:00:00):
This is an interesting question. I think there are many aspects to it and maybe if I'll take the personal aspects. So I've been in charge of the product and technology from since I joined the company. But with that, my role has changed, I think, dozens of times.

(01:00:21):
I feel I'm very fortunate to work in one company but actually work in dozens of different companies. Think about the scale that we talked about. Each point is a different, it's actually a different company and a different role and a different challenge.

(01:00:36):
And I think that something that maybe is counterintuitive personally, for me, was that in many of the phases that we undergrowed with, I felt that what got me to this phase is not necessarily what's going to make me successful in the next phase.

(01:00:55):
And if I want to be even more blunt, there will personally times when suddenly I saw how my biggest strength, for instance like, mastering all the details and having everything in my head knowing exactly what's happening on every corner of what we do. This was probably something that gave a lot of value when we were small.

(01:01:22):
But, as we got bigger, I think it suddenly created even the damage continuing to do the same thing. And in many ways, it takes time to do this realization. And I think that a good advice that I would love to have is that don't be afraid again to let go of things that you think are superpowers.

(01:01:47):
Many times your superpowers that brought you to this point and made you successful, many times you think that if you let it go you won't be successful and it's frightening. But, I really feel that you need to constantly evaluate what your current role is actually, is actually what is the role? And what is needed in order to be successful in it and not continue with the inertia?

(01:02:12):
And this is something that I wish someone has told me. Yeah. It took me time in many cases, you know? Many cases I did it too late.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):
Is there anything that helped you realize this or get good at this? Is it like coaching? Is it just doing it and surviving and failing and be like, "Oh, I see."

Daniel Lereya (01:02:29):
I think all of the above. I think that one sign for that, for me, was that in many cases I felt I'm doing a very good job. But then people, it can be like, I'll give you an example. Okay?

(01:02:50):
For instance, doing a company like Leadership QBRs. Okay, quarterly business reviews. So, when we just started it with it very early, I would actually tell about everything.

(01:03:04):
And I remember one meeting that I went out of the meeting and I say, "Wow, I really managed to convey everything and explain everything in a very articulated way."

(01:03:16):
And one of my colleagues in the core leadership team said, "Well, I didn't understand anything. What is the bottom line of all of this?" And it was like you suddenly realize that what you thought is good is not necessarily what the other people needs from you at this point.

(01:03:43):
And after understanding that, I went and ask, "What would be beneficial for you?" He said, "Listen, I want to keep in my head the three most meaningful things that you are currently facing with. I don't want to hear everything."

(01:03:55):
And it's hard. But, this was the point for me that I realized that I need to change. And I need to change something and the requirements are different.

(01:04:10):
At the beginning I tried to say, "But, listen, it's important that you know you are sticking to it." Right? But we need to let it go sometimes and think from the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):
There's this phrase that someone shared on this podcast once where, as you rise in your career, you often go from the person that is pitching leaders on something to the person being pitched. And that's a really weird place to move from, having to learn how to give great feedback, delegate, let go of things. And I love that this is a good example of that.

(01:04:44):
Since we're getting a little vulnerable and open about stuff, I want to try this question. You've done a lot of podcasts, you've done a lot of interviews, you've been all over the place. Is there anything you haven't shared anywhere else that might be helpful to share here about the journey you've been on?

Daniel Lereya (01:04:58):
Yeah, so, maybe continuing with the same point. It's a crazy journey and it's a crazy personal journey. If you think about it, I remember Roy once said, "If someone would've interviewed me to a public company of, like I would say $10 billion in market cap and managing 2,500 employees, I'm not sure that I would interview myself and get myself to the job."

(01:05:27):
And, for me, there were a lot of moments and it's constantly happening. You know, when things are going sideways and things doesn't work, and you see so many things are breaking down. You can be on the same day super happy and suddenly on the lowest point there is.

(01:05:49):
And I can show you, no. Many times I've asked myself whether I'm the right person to lead it, whether we need someone that is coming with all the experience to this phase. And I remember talked to that day with Ron. He tell me, he told me something, "Listen, first of all, as the one who built it, no one would be able to do it like you."

(01:06:14):
And I think it's an important thing to remember when times are tough. I really believe that if you have the passion, and if you have the will, and if you are willing to do the hard work in order to constantly adjust and evolve and to be vulnerable and also to say about yourself, "I didn't understand something. Now, I need to learn it and I need to deal things differently."

(01:06:44):
It's a very important point if you want to do this kind of a journey. And it's hard. And something I can share, I can reassure everyone that are listening to us, if you are feeling it, you are not the only one. Everyone are feeling it from once in a while. Be confident about yourself. Be vulnerable in order to learn and to evolve.

(01:07:06):
And I really love to do a mental exercise of saying, like we said about the product. So, let's say I'm Daniel of next six months. How do I want to look back on these six months? And what do I want to say about myself that I learned that I evolved? And this helped you get out from the state of everything is okay, I am good. And it makes you want to learn and want to evolve.

(01:07:37):
And also staying doing mode. I don't believe in, I think one thing that really characterized me is that it can be very difficult and very challenging time. But on the next day, I'm already bouncing back with energy. And in order to come and do things and win it.

(01:08:04):
And there are a lot of things that we, as leaders, needs to do in order to help ourselves to keep this mental state. So, I like to run. I like to do things that are unrelated to work in order to get back to my center.

(01:08:21):
But then quickly bounce back and to really believe in myself, in the team around me. So this, yeah, this is something maybe very personal, but I am pretty sure I'm not the only one feeling it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:37):
I appreciate you sharing that. There's a post that I did a long time ago with a coach and it was about imposter syndrome. And she made this really powerful point that you are actually an imposter in the role you're in. You've never done this before.

(01:08:54):
Most people are imposters in their role. They've never been a chief product officer. In a lot of cases they've never led teams this large. And first of all just realize that you actually are.

(01:09:05):
And second of all, that's okay and most people are like you said. And then third of all, this advice you shared about how to work through that is really powerful. Just like know many people feel this way.

(01:09:15):
Work hard, I think, is a really important part of this. Just like know there's another day and that you can bounce back.

Daniel Lereya (01:09:21):
Remember that everyone are people. No one is born to be in the world that he's currently at. And another thing that in Monday we're scaling so fast. So even people that are coming with experience and I had the chance to see it over and over again, because we're going so fast, each one of us will get to a point, which is the first time he's doing it sooner or later.

(01:09:47):
So, experience matters and we have a lot of people that are coming and bringing experience from the outside. But also remember that and remember that everyone are people and no one was born in a position.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:02):
Yeah. And in companies like yours, people have described it as every six months you have a new job.

Daniel Lereya (01:10:09):
Exactly. Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:11):
Cheryl Sandberg once did a talk that I was at where people are complaining. It was just like, "So much is changing, we're growing. The culture is not as strong as it was, and there's just like things not working. Our processes are no, hiring is hard."

(01:10:26):
And she's just like, "This is the problems you want because you're growing very fast and that's very good. Versus, if you were not growing, it'd be much more painful and hard. So, be thankful this is the problems you're facing."

Daniel Lereya (01:10:39):
I couldn't agree more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:42):
You talked about things breaking along the way and things you had to deal with. Is there an example of something? I love these stories of just maybe a moment of crisis along the journey where you thought like, "Okay, things are going to fall apart. This is over. See you, everyone."

Daniel Lereya (01:10:54):
Yeah. To be honest, we have so many. But, again, this is the problems that you are lucky to have. But, yeah, maybe I'll give you an example.

(01:11:08):
I remember this day that someone from our customer success team has approached me and say, "Listen, Daniel, we have a spike in performance issues in the board." And again, our boards is this table of think about it like of data.

(01:11:25):
And on each time we add new functionality and we make the platform more mature, people are taking it to the extreme. So, if you look back eight years ago, so this kind of tables usually had like, let's say, five columns and 100 rows. And if you look about it today, it's like hundreds of columns, tens of thousands of rows.

(01:11:45):
And so, performance is always a challenge and struggle in making sure that everything works smoothly. And this is also a value to us. We really believe that performance is the number one feature that makes people use your system. So, we came to me-

Daniel Lereya (01:12:00):
System. He came to me, and I remember that suddenly seeing the spike in the tickets, it's super hard, right? You say, wow, it's something super hard. You don't necessarily have a magic wand of fixing it immediately. And what we did, we actually, again, connected everyone to it. The first thing they did was taking disc golf to everyone in the team and showing and thinking together what we can do. And we did a lot of things and we worked really hard and we managed to make this situation better. And then time passed by and you are continuing, and then it happened again. And I can share that on the third time I said, "Okay, we had enough. We need to think totally different in a different way." And back in the days, this is where I think many of our core long-term projects have born. The signature one would be MondayDB. It's a name we use for an underlying data infrastructure that we've been building in the last three years or so.

(01:13:19):
Think about a very small team and a very small startup. I remember the day that we said, listen, we need few of our most talented people that are now not going to contribute features anymore. We are putting them on a separate place, and let's think and solve this problem while thinking about 100X. And it really, in many ways, so different from what we talked about in so many other of the examples, right? And I think now we said, listen, instead of being fixing an issue, we want this to be our competitive edge. We have a very unique product architecture where everyone can build their own schemas of the table. And it's a crazy thing in terms of technology behind it. We want to do something that will not only solve the problem, but also will serve us as a competitive edge. And we took a huge risk because we took a lot of people and put them aside for that, or not a lot of people, but the very talented people.

(01:14:27):
And I think in retrospect, by the way we released MondayDB, I think one and a half years ago, the first version, it did a huge, huge change for customers. And in many ways, this is what actually makes us today a platform which is enterprise-grade. My lesson from that is that if you feel about something, it is strategic. You need to not only solve problems, but be super proactive. And also, again, this contradicts the fact of, what are the goals, what are we going to achieve because you need to lean on something which is strategic. With everything that we said at the beginning of the conversation, there is also things that you need to do because this is the company you want to build, this is the product that you want to build. And you don't necessarily get the [inaudible 01:15:23] of getting conviction from things that happened in the past or from data. You need to just go with your intuition and take this risk. And I'm super happy that we did it, but this is an example where things really broke and what we did with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:39):
There's a couple other stories of crisis I'm thinking back to, and they all seem to be a database started reaching capacity and we are about to fall apart 'cause their growth was too fast. That's an interesting lesson for people to hear, just try to anticipate this a little more. And sounds like that's what you realized is let's think a 100X from now, not just a couple years from now. It reminds me of, so Brian Johnson, he's this dude that's trying to live forever or as long as he can and he makes this really interesting point that I promise connects to what you're talking about, which is he's like, okay, what is your goal? He asked everyone, what's your life goal? And so they're like, oh, I want to do this and this and that. To accomplish that, the base goal you're not even thinking about is you need to not die. And that's actually the number one goal everyone should have, don't die. And I feel like that's infrastructure in companies is you have all these metrics and goals, but really the goal underneath that is your infrastructure needs to scale. It makes sense why this is outside of, okay, we have all these metrics and goals, this is-

Daniel Lereya (01:16:39):
Yeah. Not necessarily treating it as a tax or as a risk, but rather for our offering as a platform, this is actually now one of our core advantages. It's super important as well, that value to customers comes in different ways, shapes and forms. And you need to think about the experience and not only about... And many times the general experience start with things that are reliable, performant, that you can count on them and suddenly you even use them differently because they're fast. I think this is another important aspect to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:16):
That's such a good point. When you have a problem, something that's slowing you down or might crumble the company, just not flipping it from how do we just put the bandaid here? How do we turn this into a strategic advantage if we really invest the time? I like that a lot. Okay. To start to close out our conversation, I'm going to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment I try to get to more and more with this podcast. And the question is, what's an example of you using AI tools in your day-to-day work to do better work, to do faster work that you think might be helpful to other folks?

Daniel Lereya (01:17:50):
Maybe I start with a personal one. It's not about work, but I think it really shows that for me, it was a moment of really saying this has so much potential in it. I actually prepared myself for a marathon and unfortunately I got injured in my knee. Yeah/ I went to do an MRI scan and I finished the scan and they gave me this disc with the results and then they said, "Listen, you need to schedule a doctor appointment five days from now." Okay. I said, I took it, put it in ChatGPT and ask for the results, an explanation of line by line, what does it mean. And then I of course went to the doctor and said, these are the results. But I think for me, this is something that I was really happy about using it and it also opens my mind a lot because I think that if you think about it from the product perspective, and this is how we think about AI in Monday, the technology is amazing, you can do so much with it, but there's still the part of productizing it because every person that I talked with him about this example, with enthusiasm he said, "How did you think about putting your MRI there?"

(01:19:15):
And I said, "I don't know, I just did." But this is all creating products that actually allow people to leverage this technology. And more on the work side, I use it a lot. I think for me, one recent example I would say is we really worked hard towards determining the pricing for AI offering that I was mentioning earlier. And just in two hours I managed to get the full perspective on what everyone else are doing. And we have analysts and we have product managers, but the fact that I was independent and managed to get the initial thoughts and all the information in just a bit, it was mind-blowing. I use it a lot in order to understand things that are very extensive, what the competitors are doing, what is the history of this and that. And I think it helped me a lot in that sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:16):
These are awesome examples. And is this all ChatGPT?Is that the tool of choice?

Daniel Lereya (01:20:22):
It's hard. I have my own periods right now, it's changing from one week to another. These two actually were with ChatGPT. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:32):
Very cool. The first example, my wife does all the time, my mother-in was in the hospital and we're waiting for the doctor to show up and she just put the chart in ChatGPT and is like, what's the problem? And it's exactly what he told us. And it feels like we're in a world now where an engineer without, say Cursor or one of these tools, that's not possible anymore. And it feels now with going to doctors, it's like if you don't do this and see what it says, you're missing out on a big gap. There's this New York Times story, I don't know if you've seen where they actually compared a doctor's analysis versus a doctor plus ChatGPT plus just ChatGPT. And guess what was the best, most accurate diagnosis?

Daniel Lereya (01:21:17):
Yeah, I want to say ChatGPT.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:21):
That's exactly what it was. Not even a doctor with ChatGPT.

Daniel Lereya (01:21:25):
I'll tell you a story about it. In the MRI, I did it because I wanted to go skiing and I didn't know if I can do it or not. I asked ChatGPT and he said all the recommendations and what I need to do and so on. And then when I was at the doctor, I asked him the same question, can I do ski? He said, "I don't know, I never ski." It's not only about getting the information straight away and getting accuracy, it's the fact that you can continue and deep dive with it. And this is something that also when I was in the pricing, it's not only the bit of information, but the fact that you can continue and continue and continue. It's definitely super impressive

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):
And it doesn't get annoyed, it doesn't get bored and it's very supportive. Yeah,

Daniel Lereya (01:22:08):
Yeah. It's always with good intent, or not, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:12):
So kind. Amazing. Okay. Well Daniel, we've covered a lot of ground. This was extremely fun. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Any other nuggets of wisdom you want to leave listeners with?

Daniel Lereya (01:22:25):
I think that in many ways, the things that we managed to achieve in Monday is due to the great people and culture that we have. And on early days, we used to take it for granted in a way, not the people but the culture, the fact that everyone understand, the fact that everyone are practicing it. And then you say, okay, culture is something that you can put your fingers on. But now as we scale, I really see how this is what actually drives everything forward. Maybe just to say on a personal note that a huge part of how I see my role is about the people and also about how we work together and what kind of an environment we want to build to ourselves. And we talked a lot about it during the episode, but I really feel that I can't underestimate on how meaningful it is and how grateful I am that I'm working with such talented people and doing what I love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:30):
That's awesome. I bet we could do a whole other episode on just culture and what you've learned. Building a culture, what the culture is like in Monday, but we got to get to our very exciting lightning round. Daniel, are you ready?

Daniel Lereya (01:23:41):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:42):
All right. I've got five questions for you. First question is, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Daniel Lereya (01:23:49):
The first one I would say is the No Rules Rules book by Netflix. Back in the days we used even the slides, but I think we took a lot of inspiration out of it. And I think that although we have different cultures, many of the things around execution, like excellent people and so on are things that I can really resonate with. And this is something that we really like to give people away after talking about our culture and so on to get inspiration also from other cultures. And another maybe on a different aspect is a book that actually Roy, our co-CEO has given to me, its name is Nonviolent Communication. And it's about effective ways of communication and understanding the people and their needs and how to communicate in a way that actually promotes an effective communication. And what I liked about this book is mainly we love to talk a lot and after we both read the book, our way of talking changed. It's very practical. I also like to give it away to our leadership and people within the team because they think it has real value in it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:16):
I'm trying to remember the framework of Nonviolent communication is like, I observed you speaking too much in this meeting and that made me feel like I wasn't listened to something like that, right? I forget the [inaudible 01:25:29].

Daniel Lereya (01:25:28):
You shouldn't be judgmental. You just need to say facts and talk about how you feel and act. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:35):
And I know I'm joking about it, but it's actually really powerful. And we had Carol Robin on the podcast who created this program at Stanford called Touchy Feely, which is similar to this whole approach to talking. And by the way, I love the combination of Israeli directness and nonviolent communication. I want to see that in action.

Daniel Lereya (01:25:55):
Yeah, definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Daniel Lereya (01:26:04):
To be honest, I don't watch TV so much. I get bored really fast and going back to other things. But when I do watch TV, so many times it's in order to clear my head. It's not that exciting things. Maybe a different thing that I'm doing is playing on the PlayStation with my son. FIFA just to vent out. Yeah. And in terms of series, maybe one thing that pops up is the Formula. I really liked it. Formula One, Netflix.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:42):
Drive to Survive.

Daniel Lereya (01:26:42):
Drive to Survive, exactly. Yeah. I really loved seeing the dynamics and everything behind. It looks like something simple of driving cars, but you see that there's so much into it. It's also really interesting and opens your mind to watch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):
Yeah. I haven't started the new season yet. I wonder if it's great.

Daniel Lereya (01:27:02):
Yeah, likewise. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:06):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Daniel Lereya (01:27:11):
I don't want to fall into all the AI trap in terms of products. Maybe I will say something, which is not so recent, but a product that I love. I really like to take pictures. And one product that I really love is Google Photos. I think that they managed to create something which takes the technology edge, but to a place where myself as a human really can connect to it and get a lot of value for it. I'm a really heavy user of that. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:47):
Yeah. That is a magical product that I think people under appreciate.

Daniel Lereya (01:27:51):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:52):
Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful and work your own life?

Daniel Lereya (01:27:58):
Stay positive. I think being positive, seeing the good things is a huge, huge power and it's a huge driver and it allows you to give energy to the people around you and it's contagious. I really love staying positive, making sure that we keep being optimistic. And it doesn't mean that you need to let go of the problems and don't see the problems, but also think about always look forward and always think how you can take the current situation and make it better. And I learned with the way that it's really more fun and actually bring better results this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:44):
I'm 1,000% aligned with that. Final question. I know you were in the army at one point in your life. Is there anything that you learned from that experience that helps you build better products?

Daniel Lereya (01:28:55):
The funny thing is that I think that like many things that I did in the Army, I was actually commanding of a very big group of people in the Army. And I think it's not about building products, but more about building teams and building this sense of purpose, sense of shared belonging. And I think that in that way many things are quite similar to, it might be counterintuitive, but many things are quite similar. And from that, many of the things of being together, although it's a hierarchical environment is something that I take with me and a lot of practical ways to lead a big organization, I would say.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:46):
Daniel, this was awesome. You're awesome. So much stuff that we went through. So many golden nuggets. I think that we're going to help a lot of people with building products, building teams, scaling, surviving, all these scaling challenges that keep coming up in these conversations. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe talk about being more transparent, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Daniel Lereya (01:30:09):
Online, I think that two main ways is by LinkedIn, I would say. And second is podcasts. I am guessing in a lot of podcasts and I think that this is a cool way to share things, full stories and full practical examples. And in terms of listeners being useful to me, so first of all, in many ways they already are useful to me. I really love your podcast and I'm getting a lot of insights from others and this is something I really love. Many of people that probably listening were also contributing to that. Thank you for that. And I really hope with that, that this episode would also be meaningful to people and that they will take value out of it. And if they are, it would be amazing to hear about it. I remember someone that sent me a picture of his new dashboard in the office and what did he do with that. And add additional ideas of what you can do that we actually took also here on Monday. If you do something, even if it's small, let me know. It's super fun to hear and also interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:24):
All right. There's the call to action. If you implement some of Daniel's advice, especially put up new dashboards or monitors in your office, please send photos. Go for LinkedIn, it sounds like, is the best medium. Daniel, thank you so much for being here.

Daniel Lereya (01:31:37):
Thank you very much, Lenny. It was a pleasure.
